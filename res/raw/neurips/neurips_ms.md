4Diffusion: Multi-view Video Diffusion Model for 4D Generation
Current 4D generation methods have achieved noteworthy efficacy with the aid of advanced diffusion generative models. However, these methods lack multi-view spatial-temporal modeling and encounter challenges in integrating diverse prior knowledge from multiple diffusion models, resulting in inconsistent temporal appearance and flickers. In this paper, we propose a novel 4D generation pipeline, named 4Diffusion, aimed at generating spatial-temporally consistent 4D content from a monocular video. We first design a unified diffusion model tailored for multi-view video generation by incorporating a learnable motion module into a frozen 3D-aware diffusion model to capture multi-view spatial-temporal correlations. After training on a curated dataset, our diffusion model acquires reasonable temporal consistency and inherently preserves the generalizability and spatial consistency of the 3D-aware diffusion model. Subsequently, we propose 4D-aware Score Distillation Sampling loss, which is based on our multi-view video diffusion model, to optimize 4D representation parameterized by dynamic NeRF. This aims to eliminate discrepancies arising from multiple diffusion models, allowing for generating spatial-temporally consistent 4D content. Moreover, we devise an anchor loss to enhance the appearance details and facilitate the learning of dynamic NeRF. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous methods.

A Benchmark Suite for Evaluating Neural Mutual Information Estimators on Unstructured Datasets
Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental metric for quantifying dependency between two random variables. When we can access only the samples, but not the underlying distribution functions, we can evaluate MI using sample-based estimators. Assessment of such MI estimators, however, has almost always relied on analytical datasets including Gaussian multivariates. Such datasets allow analytical calculations of the true MI values, but they are limited in that they do not reflect the complexities of real-world datasets. This study introduces a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating neural MI estimators on unstructured datasets, specifically focusing on images and texts. By leveraging same-class sampling for positive pairing and introducing a binary symmetric channel trick, we show that we can accurately manipulate true MI values of real-world datasets. Using the benchmark suite, we investigate seven challenging scenarios, shedding light on the reliability of neural MI estimators for unstructured datasets.

Accelerating Diffusion Models with Parallel Sampling: Inference at Sub-Linear Time Complexity
Diffusion models have become a leading method for generative modeling of both image and scientific data.As these models are costly to train and \emph{evaluate}, reducing the inference cost for diffusion models remains a major goal.Inspired by the recent empirical success in accelerating diffusion models via the parallel sampling technique~\cite{shih2024parallel}, we propose to divide the sampling process into $\mathcal{O}(1)$ blocks with parallelizable Picard iterations within each block. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly} \log d)$ overall time complexity, marking \emph{the first implementation with provable sub-linear complexity w.r.t. the data dimension $d$}. Our analysis is based on a generalized version of Girsanov's theorem and is compatible with both the SDE and probability flow ODE implementations. Our results shed light on the potential of fast and efficient sampling of high-dimensional data on fast-evolving modern large-memory GPU clusters.

Accelerating Self-supervised Learning Pretraining ðŸŒŸ
Our work tackles the computational challenges of contrastive learning methods, particularly for the pretraining of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Despite the effectiveness of contrastive learning, the substantial computational resources required for training often hinder their practical application. To mitigate this issue, we propose an acceleration framework, leveraging ViT's unique ability to generalize across inputs of varying sequence lengths. Our method employs a mix of sequence compression strategies, including randomized token dropout and flexible patch scaling, to reduce the cost of gradient estimation and accelerate convergence. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the gradient estimation error of various acceleration strategies and their performance on downstream tasks, offering valuable insights into the trade-offs between acceleration and performance.     We also propose a novel automated procedure to identify an optimal acceleration schedule that dynamically adjusts to the training progress, ensuring efficient training without sacrificing downstream performance. Our work significantly reduces the computational overhead of SSL training on the ImageNet dataset, making it more accessible to research communities and practitioners with limited computational resources. We achieve up to 4x speedup in model convergence, highlighting the potential of our methods to democratize SSL training for ViTs and other transformer-based models.

Accelerating Transformers with Spectrum-Preserving Token Merging ðŸŒŸ
Increasing the throughput of the Transformer architecture, a foundational component used in numerous state-of-the-art models for vision and language tasks (e.g., GPT, LLaVa), is an important problem in machine learning. One recent and effective strategy is to merge token representations within Transformer models, aiming to reduce computational and memory requirements while maintaining accuracy. Prior work has proposed algorithms based on Bipartite Soft Matching (BSM), which divides tokens into distinct sets and merges the top $k$ similar tokens. However, these methods have significant drawbacks, such as sensitivity to token-splitting strategies and damage to informative tokens in later layers. This paper presents a novel paradigm called PiToMe, which prioritizes the preservation of informative tokens using an additional metric termed the \textit{energy score}. This score identifies large clusters of similar tokens as high-energy, indicating potential candidates for merging, while smaller (unique and isolated) clusters are considered as low-energy and preserved. Experimental findings demonstrate that PiToMe saved from 40-60\% FLOPs of the base models while exhibiting superior off-the-shelf performance on image classification (0.5\% average performance drop of ViT-MAEH compared to 2.6\% as baselines), image-text retrieval (0.3\% average performance drop of Clip on Flick30k compared to 4.5\% as others), and analogously in visual questions answering with LLaVa-7B. Furthermore, PiToMe is theoretically shown to preserve intrinsic spectral properties to the original token space under mild conditions.

A Closer Look at AUROC and AUPRC under Class Imbalance
In machine learning (ML), a widespread claim is that the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is a superior metric for model comparison to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for tasks with class imbalance. This paper refutes this notion on two fronts. First, we theoretically characterize the behavior of AUROC and AUPRC in the presence of model mistakes, establishing clearly that AUPRC is not generally superior in cases of class imbalance. We further show that AUPRC can be a harmful metric as it can unduly favor model improvements in subpopulations with more frequent positive labels, heightening algorithmic disparities. Next, we empirically support our theory using experiments on both semi-synthetic and real-world fairness datasets. Prompted by these insights, we conduct a review of over 1.5 million scientific papers to understand the origin of this invalid claim, finding that it is often made without citation, misattributed to papers that do not argue this point, and aggressively over-generalized from source arguments. Our findings represent a dual contribution: a significant technical advancement in understanding the relationship between AUROC and AUPRC and a stark warning about unchecked assumptions in the ML community.

Adaptive Domain Learning for Cross-domain Image Denoising
Different camera sensors have different noise patterns, and thus an image denoising model trained on one sensor often does not generalize well to a different sensor. One plausible solution is to collect a large dataset for each sensor for training or fine-tuning, which is inevitably time-consuming. To address this cross-domain challenge, we present a novel adaptive domain learning (ADL) scheme for cross-domain RAW image denoising by utilizing existing data from different sensors (source domain) plus a small amount of data from the new sensor (target domain). The ADL training scheme automatically removes the data in the source domain that are harmful to fine-tuning a model for the target domain (some data are harmful as adding them during training lowers the performance due to domain gaps). Also, we introduce a modulation module to adopt sensor-specific information (sensor type and ISO) to understand input data for image denoising. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets with various smartphone and DSLR cameras, which show our proposed model outperforms prior work on cross-domain image denoising, given a small amount of image data from the target domain sensor.

AdjointDEIS: Efficient Gradients for Diffusion Models
The optimization of the latents and parameters of diffusion models with respect to some differentiable metric defined on the output of the model is a challenging and complex problem. The sampling for diffusion models is done by solving either the *probability flow* ODE or diffusion SDE wherein a neural network approximates the score function, or related quantity, allowing a numerical ODE/SDE solver to be used. However, naive backpropogation techniques are memory intensive, requiring the storage of all intermediate states, and face additional complexity in handling the injected noise from the diffusion term of the diffusion SDE. We propose a novel method based on the *stochastic adjoint sensitivity method* to calculate the gradients with respect to the initial noise, conditional information, and model parameters by solving an additional SDE whose solution is the gradient of the diffusion SDE. We exploit the unique construction of diffusion SDEs to further simplify the formulation of the adjoint diffusion SDE and use a change-of-variables to simplify the solution to an exponentially weighted integral. Using this formulation we derive a custom solver for the adjoint SDE as well as the simpler adjoint ODE. The proposed adjoint diffusion solvers can efficiently compute the gradients for both the *probability flow* ODE and diffusion SDE for latents and parameters of the model. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the adjoint diffusion solvers on the face morphing problem

Adversarially Robust Multi-task Representation Learning ðŸŒŸ
We study adversarially robust transfer learning, wherein, given labeled data on multiple (source) tasks, the goal is to train a model with small robust error on a previously unseen (target) task. In particular, we consider a multi-task representation learning (MTRL) setting, i.e., we assume that the source and target tasks admit a simple (linear) predictor on top of a shared representation (e.g., the final hidden layer of a  deep neural network). In this general setting, we provide rates on the excess adversarial (transfer) risk for Lipschitz losses and smooth nonnegative losses.These rates show that learning a representation using adversarial training on diverse tasks  helps protect against inference-time attacks in data-scarce environments. Additionally, we provide similar novel rates for single-task setting.

A Flexible, Equivariant Framework for Subgraph GNNs via Graph Products and Graph Coarsening ðŸŒŸ
Subgraph Graph Neural Networks (Subgraph GNNs) enhance the expressivity of message-passing GNNs by representing graphs as sets of subgraphs. They have shown impressive performance on several tasks, but their complexity limits applications to larger graphs. Previous approaches suggested processing only subsets of subgraphs, selected either randomly or via learnable sampling. However, they make suboptimal subgraph selections or can only cope with very small subset sizes, inevitably incurring performance degradation. This paper introduces a new Subgraph GNNs framework to address these issues.  We employ a graph coarsening function to cluster nodes into super-nodes with induced connectivity. The product between the coarsened and the original graph reveals an implicit structure whereby subgraphs are associated with specific sets of nodes. By running generalized message-passing on such graph product, our method effectively implements an efficient, yet powerful Subgraph GNN. Controlling the coarsening function enables meaningful selection of any number of subgraphs while, contrary to previous methods, being fully compatible with standard training techniques. Notably, we discover that the resulting node feature tensor exhibits new, unexplored permutation symmetries. We leverage this structure, characterize the associated linear equivariant layers and incorporate them into the layers of our Subgraph GNN architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple graph learning benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more flexible than previous approaches, as it can seamlessly handle any number of subgraphs, while consistently outperforming baseline approaches.

Algebraic Positional Encodings
We introduce a novel positional encoding strategy for Transformer-style models, addressing the shortcomings of existing, often ad hoc, approaches. Our framework provides a flexible mapping from the algebraic specification of a domain to an interpretation as orthogonal operators. This design preserves the algebraic characteristics of the source domain, ensuring that the model upholds the desired structural properties. Our scheme can accommodate various structures, including sequences, grids and trees, as well as their compositions. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach. Results suggest performance on par with or surpassing the current state-of-the-art, without hyperparameter optimizations or ``task search'' of any kind. Code is made available for review.

Algorithmic Capabilities of Random Transformers
Trained transformer models have been found to implement interpretable procedures for tasks like arithmetic and associative recall, but little is understood about how the circuits that implement these procedures originate during training. To what extent do they depend on the supervisory signal provided to models, and to what extent are they attributable to behavior already present in models at the beginning of training? To investigate these questions, we investigate what functions can be learned by randomly initialized transformers in which only the embedding layers are optimized, so that the only input--output mappings learnable from data are those already implemented (up to a choice of encoding scheme) by the randomly initialized model. We find that these random transformers can perform a wide range of meaningful algorithmic tasks, including modular arithmetic, in-weights and in-context associative recall, decimal addition, parenthesis balancing, and even some aspects of natural language text generation. Our results indicate that some algorithmic capabilities are present in transformers (and accessible via appropriately structured inputs) even before these models are trained.

Almost Surely Asymptotically Constant Graph Neural Networks ðŸŒŸ
We present a new angle on the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by studying how the predictions of a GNN probabilistic classifier evolve as we apply it on larger graphs drawn from some random graph model. We show that the output converges to a constant function, which upper-bounds what these classifiers can uniformly express. This strong convergence phenomenon applies to a very wide class of GNNs, including state of the art models, with aggregates including mean and the attention-based mechanism of graph transformers. Our results apply to a broad class of random graph models, including the (sparse) ErdÅ‘sâ€“RÃ©nyi model, the stochastic block model, and the BarabÃ¡si-Albert model. We empirically validate these findings, observing that the convergence phenomenon appears not only on random graphs but also on some real-world graphs of modest size.

Analysis of Corrected Graph Convolutions ðŸŒŸ
Machine learning for node classification on graphs is a prominent area driven by applications such as recommendation systems. State-of-the-art models often use multiple graph convolutions on the data, as empirical evidence suggests they can enhance performance. However, it has been shown empirically and theoretically, that too many graph convolutions can degrade performance significantly, a phenomenon known as oversmoothing. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, based on the contextual stochastic block model (CSBM), of the performance of vanilla graph convolution from which we remove the principal eigenvector to avoid oversmoothing. We perform a spectral analysis for $k$ rounds of corrected graph convolutions, and we provide results for partial and exact classification. For partial classification, we show that each round of convolution can reduce the misclassification error exponentially up to a saturation level, after which performance does not worsen. For exact classification, we show that the separability threshold can be improved exponentially up to $O({\log{n}}/{\log\log{n}})$ corrected convolutions.

An Efficient Memory Module for Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning
Graph incremental learning has gained widespread attention for its ability to mitigate catastrophic forgetting for graph neural networks (GNN). Conventional methods typically require numerous labels for node classification. However, obtaining abundant labels is often challenging in practice, which makes graph few-shot incremental learning necessary. Current approaches rely on large number of samples from meta-learning to construct memories, and heavy fine-tuning of the GNN parameters that lead to the loss of past knowledge. These result in significant memory consumption and loss of past knowledge information, respectively. To tackle these issues, We introduce Mecoin to efficient construct and Preserve memory. For efficient storage and update of class prototypes, Mecoin use Structured Memory Unit (SMU) to cache prototypes of the seen classes and update new class prototypes through interaction between nodes and the cached prototypes by Memory Construction module(MeCo). Besides, to avoid extensive parameter fine-tuning and forgetting, we introduce a Memory Representation Adaptive Module called MRaM to separate the learning of prototypes and class representations and use Graph Knowledge Interchange Module (GKIM) to injects past knowledge information into GNN. We analyze the effectiveness of our paradigm from the perspectives of generalization error, and discuss the impact of different distillation methods on model performance through experiments and VC-dimension. By comparison with other related methods, we validate that Mecoin achieves higher accuracy and lower forgetting rate.

An End-To-End Graph Attention Network Hash for Cross-Modal Retrieval
Due to its low storage cost and fast search speed, cross-modal retrieval based on hashing has attracted widespread attention and is widely used in real-world applications of social media search. However, most existing hashing methods are often limited by uncomprehensive feature representations and semantic associations, which greatly restricts their performance and applicability in practical applications. To deal with this challenge, in this paper we propose an end-to-end graph attention network hash (EGATH) for cross modal retrieval, which can not only capture direct semantic associations between images and texts but also match semantic content between different modalities. We adopt the CLIP combined with the Transformer to improve understanding and generalization ability in semantic consistency across different data modalities. The classifier base on graph attention network is conducted to obtain predicted labels for enhance cross-modal feature representation. We construct hash codes using an optimization strategy and loss function to preserve the semantic information and compactness of the hash code. Comprehensive experimental on the NUS-WIDE, MIRFlickr25K, and MS-COCO benchmark datasets show that our EGATH significantly performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods.

Applying Guidance in a Limited Interval Improves Sample and Distribution Quality in Diffusion Models
Guidance is a crucial technique for extracting the best performance out of image-generating diffusion models. Traditionally, a constant guidance weight has been applied throughout the sampling chain of an image. We show that guidance is clearly harmful toward the beginning of the chain (high noise levels), largely unnecessary toward the end (low noise levels), and only beneficial in the middle. We thus restrict it to a specific range of noise levels, improving both the inference speed and result quality. This limited guidance interval improves the record FID in ImageNet-512 significantly, from 1.81 to 1.40. We show that it is quantitatively and qualitatively beneficial across different sampler parameters, network architectures, and datasets, including the large-scale setting of Stable Diffusion XL. We thus suggest exposing the guidance interval as a hyperparameter in all diffusion models that use guidance.

Are Your Models Still Fair? Fairness Attacks on Graph Neural Networks via Node Injections ðŸŒŸ
Despite the remarkable capabilities demonstrated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in graph-related tasks, recent research has revealed the fairness vulnerabilities in GNNs when facing malicious adversarial attacks. However, all existing fairness attacks require manipulating the connectivity between existing nodes, which may be prohibited in reality. To this end, we introduce a Node Injection-based Fairness Attack (NIFA), exploring the vulnerabilities of GNN fairness in such a more realistic setting. In detail, NIFA first designs two insightful principles for node injection operations, namely the uncertainty-maximization principle and homophily-increase principle, and then optimizes injected nodesâ€™ feature matrix to further ensure the effectiveness of fairness attacks. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets consistently demonstrate that NIFA can significantly undermine the fairness of mainstream GNNs, even including fairness-aware GNNs, by injecting merely 1% of nodes. We sincerely hope that our work can stimulate increasing attention from researchers on the vulnerability of GNN fairness, and encourage the development of corresponding defense mechanisms.

AsyncDiff: Parallelizing Diffusion Models by Asynchronous Denoising
Diffusion models have garnered significant interest from the community for their great generative ability across various applications. However, their typical multi-step sequential-denoising nature gives rise to high cumulative latency, thereby precluding the possibilities of parallel computation. To address this, we introduce AsyncDiff, a universal and plug-and-play acceleration scheme that enables model parallelism across multiple devices. Our approach divides the cumbersome noise prediction model into multiple components, assigning each to a different device. To break the dependency chain between these components, it transforms the conventional sequential denoising into an asynchronous process by exploiting the high similarity between hidden states in consecutive diffusion steps. Consequently, each component is facilitated to compute in parallel on separate devices. The proposed strategy significantly reduces inference latency while minimally impacting the generative quality. Specifically, for the Stable Diffusion v2.1, AsyncDiff achieves a 2.7x speedup with negligible degradation and a 4.0x speedup with only a slight reduction of 0.38 in CLIP Score, on four NVIDIA A5000 GPUs. Our experiments also demonstrate AsyncDiff can be readily applied to video diffusion models with encouraging performances.

A Topology-aware Graph Coarsening Framework for Continual Graph Learning ðŸŒŸ
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) experience "catastrophic forgetting" in continual learning setups, where they tend to lose previously acquired knowledge and perform poorly on old tasks. Rehearsal-based methods, which consolidate old knowledge with a replay memory buffer, are a de facto solution due to their straightforward workflow. However, these methods often fail to adequately capture topological information, leading to incorrect input-label mappings in replay samples. To address this, we propose TACO, a topology-aware graph coarsening and continual learning framework that stores information from previous tasks as a reduced graph. Throughout each learning period, this reduced graph expands by integrating with a new graph and aligning shared nodes, followed by a "zoom-out" reduction process to maintain a stable size. We have developed a graph coarsening algorithm based on node representation proximities to efficiently reduce a graph while preserving essential topological information. We empirically demonstrate that the learning process on the reduced graph can closely approximate that on the original graph. We compare TACO with a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines, proving its superiority and the necessity of preserving high-quality topological information for effective replaying.

Batched Energy-Entropy acquisition for Bayesian Optimization
Bayesian optimization (BO) is an attractive machine learning framework for performing sample-efficient global optimization of black-box functions. The optimization process is guided by an acquisition function that selects points to acquire in each round of BO. In batched BO, when multiple points are acquired in parallel, commonly used acquisition functions are often high-dimensional and intractable, leading to the use of sampling-based alternatives. We propose a statistical physics inspired acquisition function that can natively handle batches. Batched Energy-Entropy acquisition for BO (BEEBO) enables tight control of the explore-exploit trade-off of the optimization process and generalizes to heteroskedastic black-box problems. We demonstrate the applicability of BEEBO on a range of problems, showing competitive performance to existing acquisition functions.

Bayesian Domain Adaptation with Gaussian Mixture Domain-Indexing
Recent methods are proposed to improve  performance of domain adaptation by inferring domain index under an adversarial variational bayesian framework, where domain index is unavailable. However, existing methods typically assume that all the global domain indices are sampled from a vanilla gaussian prior, overlooking the inherent structures among different domains.To address this challenge, we propose a Bayesian Domain Adaptation with Gaussian Mixture Domain-Indexing(GMDI) algorithm. GMDI employs a Gaussian Mixture Model for domain indices, with the number of component distributions in the ``domain-themes'' space adaptively determined by a Chinese Restaurant Process. By dynamically adjusting the mixtures at the domain indices level, GMDI significantly improves domain adaptation performance. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GMDI achieves a more stringent evidence lower bound, closer to the log-likelihood. For classification, GMDI improves accuracy by at least 63% (from 33.5% to 96.5%), outperforms all methods, and surpasses the state-of-the-art method, VDI, by up to 3.4%, reaching 99.3%. For regression, GMDI reduces MSE by 16.4% (from 2.496 to 2.087) and by 21.1% (from 3.160 to 2.493), achieving the lowest errors among all methods.

Bayesian Nonparametrics Meets Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Optimization
Training machine learning and statistical models often involves optimizing a data-driven risk criterion. The risk is usually computed with respect to the empirical data distribution, but this may result in poor and unstable out-of-sample performance due to distributional uncertainty. In the spirit of distributionally robust optimization, we propose a novel robust criterion by combining insights from Bayesian nonparametric (i.e., Dirichlet process) theory and a recent decision-theoretic model of smooth ambiguity-averse preferences. First, we highlight novel connections with standard regularized empirical risk minimization techniques, among which Ridge and LASSO regressions. Then, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of favorable finite-sample and asymptotic statistical guarantees on the performance of the robust optimization procedure. For practical implementation, we propose and study tractable approximations of the criterion based on well-known Dirichlet process representations. We also show that the smoothness of the criterion naturally leads to standard gradient-based numerical optimization. Finally, we provide insights into the workings of our method by applying it to a variety of tasks based on simulated and real datasets.

Bayesian Optimization of Functions over Node Subsets in Graphs ðŸŒŸ
We address the problem of optimizing over functions defined on node subsets in a graph.  The optimization of such functions is often a non-trivial task given their combinatorial, black-box and expensive-to-evaluate nature. Although various algorithms have been introduced in the literature, most are either task-specific or computationally inefficient and only utilize information about the graph structure without considering the characteristics of the function. To address these limitations, we utilize Bayesian Optimization (BO), a sample-efficient black-box solver, and propose a novel framework for combinatorial optimization on graphs. More specifically, we map each $k$-node subset in the original graph to a node in a new combinatorial graph and adopt a local modeling approach to efficiently traverse the latter graph by progressively sampling its subgraphs using a recursive algorithm. Extensive experiments under both synthetic and real-world setups demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BO framework on various types of graphs and optimization tasks, where its behavior is analyzed in detail with ablation studies.

Beyond Concept Bottleneck Models: How to Make Black Boxes Intervenable?
Recently, interpretable machine learning has re-explored concept bottleneck models (CBM). An advantage of this model class is the user's ability to intervene on predicted concept values, affecting the downstream output. In this work, we introduce a method to perform such concept-based interventions on *pretrained* neural networks, which are not interpretable by design, only given a small validation set with concept labels. Furthermore, we formalise the notion of *intervenability* as a measure of the effectiveness of concept-based interventions and leverage this definition to fine-tune black boxes. Empirically, we explore the intervenability of black-box classifiers on synthetic tabular and natural image benchmarks. We focus on backbone architectures of varying complexity, from simple, fully connected neural nets to Stable Diffusion. We demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning improves intervention effectiveness and often yields better-calibrated predictions. To showcase the practical utility of our techniques, we apply them to deep chest X-ray classifiers and show that fine-tuned black boxes are more intervenable than CBMs. Lastly, we establish that our methods are still effective under vision-language-model-based concept annotations, alleviating the need for a human-annotated validation set.

Beyond Redundancy: Information-aware Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Structure Learning ðŸŒŸ
Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Learning (UMGL) aims to learn node representations on diverse edge types without manual labeling. However, existing research overlooks a key factor: the reliability of the graph structure. Real-world data often exhibit a complex nature and contain abundant task-irrelevant noise, severely compromising UMGL's performance. Moreover, existing methods primarily rely on contrastive learning to maximize mutual information across different graphs, limiting them to multiplex graph redundant scenarios and failing to capture view-unique task-relevant information. In this paper, we focus on a more realistic and challenging task: to unsupervisedly learn a fused graph from multiple graph that preserves sufficient task-relevant information while removing task-irrelevant noise. Specifically, our proposed Information-aware Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Fusion framework (InfoMGF) uses graph structure refinement to eliminate irrelevant noise and simultaneously maximizes view-shared and view-unique task-relevant information, thereby tackling the frontier of non-redundant multiplex graph. Theoretical analyses further guarantee the effectiveness of InfoMGF. Comprehensive experiments against various baselines on different downstream tasks demonstrate its superior performance and robustness. Surprisingly, our unsupervised method even beats sophisticated supervised approaches.

Boosting Graph Pooling with Persistent Homology ðŸŒŸ
Recently, there has been an emerging trend to integrate persistent homology (PH) into graph neural networks (GNNs) to enrich expressive power. However, naively plugging PH features into GNN layers always results in marginal improvement with low interpretability. In this paper, we investigate a novel mechanism for injecting global topological invariance into pooling layers using PH, motivated by the observation that filtration operation in PH naturally aligns graph pooling in a cut-off manner. In this fashion, message passing in the coarsened graph acts along persistent pooled topology, leading to improved performance. Experimentally, we apply our mechanism to a collection of graph pooling methods and observe consistent and substantial performance gain over several popular datasets, demonstrating its wide applicability and flexibility.

Breaking Determinism: Fuzzy Modeling of Sequential Recommendation Using Discrete State Space Diffusion Model
Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict items that users may be interested in based on their historical behavior sequences. We revisit SR from a novel information-theoretic perspective and find that conventional sequential modeling methods fail to adequately capture the randomness and unpredictability of user behavior. Inspired by fuzzy information processing theory, this paper introduces the DDSR model, which uses fuzzy sets of interaction sequences to overcome the limitations and better capture the evolution of users' real interests. Formally based on diffusion transition processes in discrete state spaces, which is unlike common diffusion models such as DDPM that operate in continuous domains. It is better suited for discrete data, using structured transitions instead of arbitrary noise introduction to avoid information loss. Additionally, to address the inefficiency of matrix transformations due to the vast discrete space, we use semantic labels derived from quantization or RQ-VAE to replace item IDs, enhancing efficiency and improving cold start issues. Testing on three public benchmark datasets shows that DDSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in various settings, demonstrating its potential and effectiveness in handling SR tasks.

Challenges of Generating Structurally Diverse Graphs
For many graph-related problems, it can be essential to have a set of structurally diverse graphs. For instance, such graphs can be used for testing graph algorithms or their neural approximations. However, to the best of our knowledge, the problem of generating structurally diverse graphs has not been explored in the literature. In this paper, we fill this gap. First, we discuss how to define diversity for a set of graphs, why this task is non-trivial, and how one can choose a proper diversity measure. Then, for a given diversity measure, we propose and compare several algorithms optimizing it: we consider approaches based on standard random graph models, local graph optimization, genetic algorithms, and neural generative models. We show that it is possible to significantly improve diversity over basic random graph generators. Additionally, our analysis of generated graphs allows us to better understand the properties of graph distances: depending on which diversity measure is used for optimization, the obtained graphs may possess very different structural properties which gives insights about the sensitivity of the graph distance underlying the diversity measure.

CIFD: Controlled Information Flow to Enhance Knowledge Distillation
Knowledge Distillation is the mechanism by which the insights gained from a larger teacher model are transferred to a smaller student model. However, the transfer suffers when the teacher model is significantly larger than the student. To overcome this, prior works have proposed training intermediately sized models, Teacher Assistants (TAs) to help the transfer process. However, training TAs is expensive, as training these models is a knowledge transfer task in itself. Further, these TAs are larger than the student model and training them especially in large data settings can be computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Controlled Information Flow for Knowledge Distillation (CIFD) consisting of two components. First, we propose a significantly smaller alternatives to TAs, the Rate-Distortion Module (RDM) which uses the teacher's penultimate layer embedding and a information rate-constrained bottleneck layer to replace the Teacher Assistant model. RDMs are smaller and easier to train than TAs, especially in large data regimes, since they operate on the teacher embeddings and do not need to relearn low level input feature extractors. Also, by varying the information rate across the bottleneck, RDMs can replace TAs of different sizes. Secondly, we propose the use of Information Bottleneck Module in the student model, which is crucial for regularization in the presence of a large number of RDMs. We show comprehensive state-of-the-art results of the proposed method over large datasets like Imagenet. Further, we show the significant improvement in distilling CLIP like models over a huge 12M image-text dataset. It outperforms CLIP specialized distillation methods across five zero-shot classification datasets and two zero-shot image-text retrieval datasets.

Classic GNNs are Strong Baselines: Reassessing GNNs for Node Classification ðŸŒŸ
Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as popular alternatives to traditional message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), due to their theoretically superior expressiveness and impressive performance reported on standard node classification benchmarks, often significantly outperforming GNNs. In this paper, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis to reevaluate the performance of three classic GNN models (GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE) against GTs. Our findings suggest that the previously reported superiority of GTs may have been overstated due to suboptimal hyperparameter configurations in GNNs. Remarkably, with slight hyperparameter tuning, these classic GNN models achieve state-of-the-art performance, matching or even exceeding that of recent GTs across 17 out of the 18 diverse datasets examined. Additionally, we conduct detailed ablation studies to investigate the influence of various GNN configurationsâ€”such as normalization, dropout, residual connections, network depth, and jumping knowledge modeâ€”on node classification performance. Our study aims to promote a higher standard of empirical rigor in the field of graph machine learning, encouraging more accurate comparisons and evaluations of model capabilities.

Classification Diffusion Models: Revitalizing Density Ratio Estimation
A prominent family of methods for learning data distributions relies on density ratio estimation (DRE), where a model is trained to *classify* between data samples and samples from some reference distribution. DRE-based models can directly output the likelihood for any given input, a highly desired property that is lacking in most generative techniques. Nevertheless, to date, DRE methods have struggled to accurately capture the distributions of complex high-dimensional data like images, which led to reduced research attention over the years. In this work we present *classification diffusion models* (CDMs), a DRE-based generative method that adopts the formalism of denoising diffusion models (DDMs) while making use of a classifier that predicts the level of noise added to a clean signal. Our method is based on an analytical connection that we derive between an MSE-optimal denoiser for white Gaussian noise and a cross-entropy-optimal classifier for predicting the noise level. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first DRE-based technique that can successfully generate images. Furthermore, it can output the likelihood of any input in a single forward pass, achieving state-of-the-art negative log likelihood (NLL) among methods with this property.

CLIPLoss and Norm-Based Data Selection Methods for Multimodal Contrastive Learning
Data selection has emerged as a core issue for large-scale visual-language model pretaining (e.g., CLIP), particularly with noisy web-curated datasets. Three main data selection approaches are: (1) leveraging external non-CLIP models to aid data selection, (2) training new CLIP-style embedding models that are more effective at selecting high-quality data than the original OpenAI CLIP model, and (3) designing better metrics or strategies universally applicable to any CLIP embedding without requiring specific model properties (e.g., CLIPScore is one popular metric).  While the first two approaches have been extensively studied, the third remains under-explored. In this paper, we advance the third approach by proposing two new methods. Firstly, instead of classical CLIP scores that only consider the alignment between two modalities from a single sample, we introduce $\textbf{negCLIPLoss}$, a CLIP loss-inspired method that adds the alignment between one sample and its contrastive pairs as an extra normalization term for better quality measurement. Secondly, when downstream tasks are known, we propose a new norm-based metric, $\textbf{NormSim}$, to measure the similarity between pretraining data and target data. We test our methods on the data selection benchmark, DataComp [Gadre et al., 2023]. Compared to the best baseline using only OpenAI's CLIP-L/14, our methods achieve a 5.3\% improvement on ImageNet-1k and a 2.8\% improvement on 38 downstream evaluation tasks. Moreover, both $\textbf{negCLIPLoss}$ and $\textbf{NormSim}$ are compatible with existing techniques. By combining our methods with the current best methods DFN [Fang et al., 2023] and HYPE [Kim et al., 2024], we can boost average performance on downstream tasks by 0.9\%, achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Compositional PAC-Bayes: Generalization of GNNs with persistence and beyond ðŸŒŸ
Descriptors based on Persistent Homology (PH) are being increasingly integrated into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to augment them with rich topological features. However, the generalization of PH schemes remains unexplored. The heterogeneity of GNN layers and persistent vectorization components poses further key challenges in analyzing the generalization behavior of the overall model.  We introduce a novel _compositional_ PAC-Bayes framework to accommodate a broad spectrum of models including those with heterogeneous layers, providing the first data-dependent generalization bounds for a widely adopted PH vectorization scheme (that subsumes persistence landscapes, images, and silhouettes) as well as persistence-augmented GNNs. Our bounds also inform the design of novel regularizers. Existing bounds for GNNs and neural nets are recovered with ease. Empirical evaluations on several standard real-world datasets demonstrate that our bounds accurately predict the generalization performance, leading to improved classifier design via our regularizers. Overall, this work bridges a crucial gap in the theoretical understanding of PH methods and general heterogeneous models, paving the way for the  design of better models for (graph) representation learning.

Continuous Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Recognition ðŸŒŸ
Long-tailed semi-supervised learning poses a significant challenge in training models with limited labeled data exhibiting a long-tailed label distribution. Current state-of-the-art LTSSL approaches heavily rely on high-quality pseudo-labels for large-scale unlabeled data. However, these methods often neglect the impact of representations learned by the neural network and struggle with real-world unlabeled data, which typically follows a different distribution than labeled data. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic framework that unifies various recent proposals in long-tail learning. Our framework derives the class-balanced contrastive loss through Gaussian kernel density estimation. We introduce a continuous contrastive learning method, CCL, extending our framework to unlabeled data using *reliable* and *smoothed* pseudo-labels. By progressively estimating the underlying label distribution and optimizing its alignment with model predictions, we tackle the diverse distribution of unlabeled data in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets with varying unlabeled data distributions demonstrate that CCL consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 4% improvement on the ImageNet-127 dataset. The supplementary material includes the source code for reproducibility.

Continuous Partitioning for Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning ðŸŒŸ
Laplace learning algorithms for graph-based semi-supervised learning have been shown to produce degenerate predictions at low label rates and in imbalanced class regimes, particularly near class boundaries. We propose CutSSL: a framework for graph-based semi-supervised learning based on continuous nonconvex quadratic programming, which provably obtains \emph{integer} solutions. Our framework is naturally motivated by an \emph{exact} quadratic relaxation of a cardinality-constrained minimum-cut graph partitioning problem. Furthermore, we show our formulation is related to an optimization problem whose approximate solution is the mean-shifted Laplace learning heuristic, thus providing new insight into the performance of this heuristic. We demonstrate that CutSSL significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art on k-nearest neighbor graphs and large real-world graph benchmarks across a variety of label rates, class imbalance, and label imbalance regimes. Our implementation is available on Colab\footnote{\url{https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tGU5rxE1N5d0KGcNzlvZ0BgRc7_vob7b?usp=sharing}}.

Credal Learning Theory
Statistical learning theory is the foundation of machine learning, providing theoretical bounds for the risk of models learned from a (single) training set, assumed to issue from an unknown probability distribution. In actual deployment, however, the data distribution may (and often does) vary, causing domain adaptation/generalization issues. In this paper we lay the foundations for a `credal' theory of learning, using convex sets of probabilities (credal sets) to model the variability in the data-generating distribution. Such credal sets, we argue, may be inferred from a finite sample of training sets. Bounds are derived for the case of finite hypotheses spaces (both assuming realizability or not), as well as infinite model spaces, which directly generalize classical results.

Data Augmentation with Diffusion for Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning ðŸŒŸ
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) seeks to utilize unlabeled data to overcome the limited amount of labeled data and improve model performance. However, many SSL methods typically struggle in real-world scenarios, particularly when there is a large number of irrelevant instances in the unlabeled data that do not belong to any class in the labeled data. Previous approaches often downweight instances from irrelevant classes to mitigate the negative impact of class distribution mismatch on model training. However, by discarding irrelevant instances, they may result in the loss of valuable information such as invariance, regularity, and diversity within the data. In this paper, we propose a data-centric generative augmentation approach that leverages a diffusion model to enrich labeled data using both labeled and unlabeled samples. A key challenge is extracting the diversity inherent in the unlabeled data while mitigating the generation of samples irrelevant to the labeled data. To tackle this issue, we combine diffusion model training with a discriminator that identifies and reduces the impact of irrelevant instances. We also demonstrate that such a trained diffusion model can even convert an irrelevant instance into a relevant one, yielding highly effective synthetic data for training. Through a comprehensive suite of experiments, we show that our data augmentation approach significantly enhances the performance of SSL methods, especially in the presence of class distribution mismatch.

Denoising Diffusion Path: Attribution Noise Reduction with An Auxiliary Diffusion Model
The explainability of deep neural networks (DNNs) is critical for trust and reliability in AI systems. Path-based attribution methods, such as Integrated Gradients (IG), aim to explain predictions by accumulating gradients along a path from a baseline to the target image.  However, noise accumulated during this process can significantly distort the explanation. Existing methods primarily focus on finding alternative paths to bypass noise while overlooking a crucial factor that intermediate steps often deviate from the training data distribution, further amplifying noise. This work presents a novel Denoising Diffusion Path (DDPath) to tackle this challenge by harnessing the power of diffusion models for denoising.  By leveraging the inherent ability of diffusion models to progressively remove noise from an image, DDPath constructs a piece-wise linear path where each segment guarantees samples drawn from a Gaussian distribution centered at the target image; this also ensures the gradual disappearance of noise along the path towards cleaner and more interpretable attributions.  We further demonstrate that DDPath adheres to essential axiomatic properties for attribution methods and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods like IG. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DDPath significantly reduces noise in the attributions---resulting in clearer explanations---and achieves better quantitative results compared to traditional path-based methods.

DFA-GNN: Forward Learning of Graph Neural Networks by Direct Feedback Alignment ðŸŒŸ
Graph neural networks (GNNs) are recognized for their strong performance across various applications, with the backpropagation (BP) algorithm playing a central role in the development of most GNN models. However, despite its effectiveness, BP has limitations that challenge its biological plausibility and affect the efficiency, scalability and parallelism of training neural networks for graph-based tasks. While several non-backpropagation (non-BP) training algorithms, such as the direct feedback alignment (DFA), have been successfully applied to fully-connected and convolutional network components for handling Euclidean data, directly adapting these non-BP frameworks to manage non-Euclidean graph data in GNN models presents significant challenges. These challenges primarily arise from the violation of the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in graph data and the difficulty in accessing prediction errors for all samples (nodes) within the graph. To overcome these obstacles, in this paper we propose DFA-GNN, a novel forward learning framework tailored for GNNs with a case study of semi-supervised learning. The proposed method breaks the limitations of BP by using a dedicated forward training mechanism. Specifically, DFA-GNN extends the principles of DFA to adapt to graph data and unique architecture of GNNs, which incorporates the information of graph topology into the feedback links to accommodate the non-Euclidean characteristics of graph data. Additionally, for semi-supervised graph learning tasks, we developed a pseudo error generator that spreads residual errors from training data to create a pseudo error for each unlabeled node. These pseudo errors are then utilized to train GNNs using DFA. Extensive experiments on 10 public benchmarks reveal that our learning framework outperforms not only previous non-BP methods but also the standard BP methods, and it exhibits excellent robustness against various types of noise and attacks.

DiffAug: A Diffuse-and-Denoise Augmentation for Training Robust Classifiers
We introduce DiffAug, a simple and efficient diffusion-based augmentation technique to train image classifiers for the crucial yet challenging goal of improved classifier robustness. Applying DiffAug to a given example consists of one forward-diffusion step followed by one reverse-diffusion step. Using both ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer architectures, we comprehensively evaluate classifiers trained with DiffAug and demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of single-step reverse diffusion in improving robustness to covariate shifts, certified adversarial accuracy and out of distribution detection. When we combine DiffAug with other augmentations such as AugMix and DeepAugment we demonstrate further improved robustness. Finally, building on this approach, we also improve classifier-guided diffusion wherein we observe improvements in: (i) classifier-generalization, (ii) gradient quality (i.e., improved perceptual alignment) and (iii) image generation performance. We thus introduce a computationally efficient technique for training with improved robustness that does not require any additional data, and effectively complements existing augmentation approaches.

Diffusion-based Curriculum Reinforcement Learning ðŸŒŸ
Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is an approach to facilitate the learning process of agents by structuring tasks in a sequence of increasing complexity. Despite its potential, many existing CRL methods struggle to efficiently guide agents toward desired outcomes, particularly in the absence of domain knowledge. This paper introduces DiCuRL (Diffusion Curriculum Reinforcement Learning), a novel method that leverages conditional diffusion models to generate curriculum goals. To estimate how close an agent is to achieving its goal, our method uniquely incorporates a $Q$-function and a trainable reward function based on Adversarial Intrinsic Motivation within the diffusion model. Furthermore, it promotes exploration through the inherent noising and denoising mechanism present in the diffusion models and is environment-agnostic. This combination allows for the generation of challenging yet achievable goals, enabling agents to learn effectively without relying on domain knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiCuRL in three different maze environments simulated in MuJoCo, where it outperforms or matches nine state-of-the-art CRL algorithms from the literature.

Diffusion Models are Certifiably Robust Classifiers
Generative learning, recognized for its effective modeling of data distributions, offers inherent advantages in handling out-of-distribution instances, especially for enhancing robustness to adversarial attacks. Among these, diffusion classifiers, utilizing powerful diffusion models, have demonstrated superior empirical robustness. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of their robustness is still lacking, raising concerns about their vulnerability to stronger future attacks. In this study, we prove that diffusion classifiers possess $O(1)$ Lipschitzness, and establish their certified robustness, demonstrating their inherent resilience. To achieve non-constant Lipschitzness, thereby obtaining much tighter certified robustness, we generalize diffusion classifiers to classify Gaussian-corrupted data. This involves deriving the evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) for these distributions, approximating the likelihood using the ELBO, and calculating classification probabilities via Bayes' theorem. Experimental results show the superior certified robustness of these Noised Diffusion Classifiers (NDCs). Notably, we achieve over 80\% and 70\% certified robustness on CIFAR-10 under adversarial perturbations with \(\ell_2\) norms less than 0.25 and 0.5, respectively, using a single off-the-shelf diffusion model without any additional data.

Diffusion Models With Learned Adaptive Noise ðŸŒŸ
Diffusion models have gained traction as powerful algorithms for synthesizing high-quality images. Central to these algorithms is the diffusion process, a set of equations which maps data to noise in a way that can significantly affect performance. In this paper, we explore whether the diffusionprocess can be learned from data.Our work is grounded in Bayesian inference and seeks to improve log-likelihood estimation by casting the learned diffusion process as an approximate variational posterior that yields a tighter lower bound (ELBO) on the likelihood.A widely held assumption is that the ELBO is invariant to the noise process: our work dispels this assumption and proposes multivariate learned adaptive noise (MuLAN), a learned diffusion process that applies noise at different rates across an image. Our method consists of three components: a multivariate noise schedule, adaptive input-conditional diffusion, and auxiliary variables; these components ensure that the ELBO is no longer invariant to the choice of the noise schedule as in previous works.  Empirically, MuLAN sets a new **state-of-the-art** in density estimation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet while matching the performance of previous state-of-the-art models with **50%** fewer steps.

Diffusion Model with Cross Attention as an Inductive Bias for Disentanglement
Disentangled representation learning strives to extract the intrinsic factors within observed data. Factorizing these representations in an unsupervised manner is notably challenging and usually requires tailored loss functions or specific structural designs. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective and framework, demonstrating that diffusion models with cross-attention can serve as a powerful inductive bias to facilitate the learning of disentangled representations. We propose to encode an image to a set of concept tokens and treat them as the condition of the latent diffusion for image reconstruction, where cross-attention over the concept tokens is used to bridge the interaction between the encoder and diffusion. Without any additional regularization, this framework achieves superior disentanglement performance on the benchmark datasets, surpassing all previous methods with intricate designs. We have conducted comprehensive ablation studies and visualization analysis, shedding light on the functioning of this model. We anticipate that our findings will inspire more investigation on exploring diffusion for disentangled representation learning towards more sophisticated data analysis and understanding.

Diffusion Priors for Variational Image Denoising ðŸŒŸ
Real-world noise removal is crucial in low-level computer vision. Due to the remarkable generation capabilities of diffusion models, recent attention has shifted towards leveraging diffusion priors for image restoration tasks. However, existing diffusion priors-based methods either consider simple noise types or rely on approximate posterior estimation, limiting their effectiveness in addressing structured and signal-dependent noise commonly found in real-world images. In this paper, we build upon diffusion priors and propose adaptive likelihood estimation and MAP inference during the reverse diffusion process to tackle real-world noise. We introduce an independent, non-identically distributed likelihood combined with the noise precision (inverse variance) prior and dynamically infer the precision posterior using variational Bayes during the generation process. Meanwhile, we rectify the estimated noise variance through local Gaussian convolution. The final denoised image is obtained by propagating intermediate MAP solutions that balance the updated likelihood and diffusion prior. Additionally, we explore the local diffusion prior inherent in low-resolution diffusion models, enabling direct handling of high-resolution noisy images. Extensive experiments and analyses on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Diffusion Representation for Reinforcement Learning
Diffusion-based models have achieved notable empirical successes in reinforcement learning (RL) due to their expressiveness in modeling complex distributions. Despite existing methods being promising, the key challenge of extending them for broader real-world applications lies in the computational cost at inference time, i.e., sampling from a diffusion model is considerably slow as it often requires tens to hundreds of iterations to generate even one sample. To circumvent this issue, we propose to leverage the flexibility of diffusion models for RL from a representation learning perspective. In particular, by exploiting the connection between diffusion model and energy-based model, we develop Diff-Rep, a coherent algorithm framework that enables extracting sufficient representations for value functions in Markov decision processes (MDP) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). We further demonstrate how Diff-Rep facilitates efficient policy optimization and practical algorithms while explicitly bypassing the difficulty and inference cost of sampling from the diffusion model. Finally, we provide comprehensive empirical studies to verify the benefits of Diff-Rep in delivering robust and advantageous performance across various benchmarks with both fully and partially observable settings.

Diffusion Twigs with Loop Guidance for Conditional Graph Generation
We introduce a novel score-based diffusion framework named Twigs that incorporates multiple co-evolving flows for enriching conditional generation tasks. Specifically, a central or trunk diffusion process is associated with a primary variable (e.g., graph structure), and additional offshoot or stem processes are dedicated to dependent variables (e.g., graph properties or labels). A new strategy, which we call loop guidance, effectively orchestrates the flow of information between the trunk and the stem processes during sampling. This approach allows us to uncover intricate interactions and dependencies, and unlock new generative capabilities. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate strong performance gains of the proposed method over contemporary baselines in the context of conditional graph generation, underscoring the potential of Twigs in challenging generative tasks such as inverse molecular design.

DiGRAF: Diffeomorphic Graph-Adaptive Activation Function
In this paper, we propose a novel activation function tailored specifically for graph data in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Motivated by the need for graph-adaptive and flexible activation functions, we introduce DiGRAF, leveraging Continuous Piecewise-Affine Based (CPAB) transformations, which we augment with an additional GNN to learn a graph-adaptive diffeomorphic activation function in an end-to-end manner. In addition to its graph-adaptivity and flexibility, DiGRAF also possesses properties that are widely recognized as desirable for activation functions, such as differentiability, boundness within the domain and computational efficiency. We conduct an extensive set of experiments across diverse datasets and tasks, demonstrating a consistent and superior performance of DiGRAF compared to traditional and graph-specific activation functions, highlighting its effectiveness as an activation function for GNNs.

Discrete-state Continuous-time Diffusion for Graph Generation
Graph is a prevalent discrete data structure, whose generation has wide applications such as drug discovery and circuit design. Diffusion generative models, as an emerging research focus, have been applied to graph generation tasks. Overall, according to the space of states and time steps, diffusion generative models can be categorized into discrete-/continuous-state discrete-/continuous-time fashions. In this paper, we formulate the graph diffusion generation in a discrete-state continuous-time setting, which has never been studied in previous graph diffusion models. The rationale of such a formulation is to preserve the discrete nature of graph-structured data and meanwhile provide flexible sampling trade-offs between sample quality and efficiency. Analysis shows that our training objective is closely related to the generation quality and our proposed generation framework enjoys ideal invariant/equivariant properties concerning the permutation of node ordering. Our proposed model shows competitive empirical performance against other state-of-the-art graph generation solutions on various benchmarks while at the same time can flexibly trade off the generation quality and efficiency in the sampling phase.

Dissecting the Failure of Invariant Learning on Graphs
Enhancing node-level Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs remains a crucial area. In this paper, we develop a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to theoretically dissect the performance of two prominent invariant learning methods--Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and Variance-Risk Extrapolation (VREx)--in node-level OOD settings. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these methods may struggle to identify invariant features due to the complexities introduced by the message-passing mechanism, which can obscure causal features within a range of neighboring samples. To address this, we propose Cross-environment Intra-class Alignment (CIA), which explicitly eliminates spurious features by aligning representations within the same class, bypassing the need for explicit knowledge of underlying causal patterns. To adapt CIA to node-level OOD scenarios where environment labels are hard to obtain, we further propose CIA-LRA (Localized Reweighting Alignment) that leverages the distribution of neighboring labels to selectively align node representations, effectively distinguishing and preserving invariant features while removing spurious ones, all without relying on environment labels. We theoretically prove CIA-LRA's effectiveness by deriving an OOD generalization error bound based on PAC-Bayesian analysis. Experiments on graph OOD benchmarks validate the superiority of CIA and CIA-LRA, marking a significant advancement in node-level OOD generalization.

Efficient Graph Matching for Correlated Stochastic Block Models
We study learning problems on correlated stochastic block models with two balanced communities. Our main result gives the first efficient algorithm for graph matching in this setting. In the most interesting regime where the average degree is logarithmic in the number of vertices, this algorithm correctly matches all but a vanishing fraction of vertices with high probability, whenever the edge correlation parameter $s$ satisfies $s^2 > \alpha \approx 0.338$, where $\alpha$ is Otter's tree-counting constant. Moreover, we extend this to an efficient algorithm for exact graph matching whenever this is information-theoretically possible, positively resolving an open problem of RÃ¡cz and Sridhar (NeurIPS 2021). Our algorithm generalizes the recent breakthrough work of Mao, Wu, Xu, and Yu (STOC 2023), which is based on centered subgraph counts of a large family of trees termed chandeliers. A major technical challenge that we overcome is dealing with the additional estimation errors that are necessarily present due to the fact that, in relevant parameter regimes, the latent community partition cannot be exactly recovered from a single graph. As an application of our results, we give an efficient algorithm for exact community recovery using multiple correlated graphs in parameter regimes where it is information-theoretically impossible to do so using just a single graph.

Elliptical Attention
Pairwise dot-product self-attention is key to the success of transformers that achieve state-of-the-art performance across a variety of applications in language and vision. This dot-product self-attention computes attention weights among the input tokens using Euclidean distance, which makes the model prone to representation collapse and vulnerable to contaminated samples. In this paper, we propose using a Mahalanobis distance metric for computing the attention weights to stretch the underlying feature space in directions of high contextual relevance. In particular, we define a hyper-ellipsoidal neighborhood around each query to increase the attention weights of the tokens lying in the contextually important directions. We term this novel class of attention Elliptical Attention. Our Elliptical Attention provides two benefits: 1) reducing representation collapse and 2) enhancing the model's robustness as the Elliptical Attention pays more attention to contextually relevant information, rather than focusing on some small subset of informative features. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of Elliptical Attention over the baseline dot-product attention and state-of-the-art attention methods on various practical tasks, including object classification, imagesegmentation, and language modeling across different data modalities.

Energy-based Epistemic Uncertainty for Graph Neural Networks
In domains with interdependent data, such as graphs, quantifying the epistemic uncertainty of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is challenging as uncertainty can arise at different structural scales. Existing techniques neglect this issue or only distinguish between structure-aware and structure-agnostic uncertainty without combining them into a single measure. We propose GEBM, an energy-based model (EBM) that provides high-quality uncertainty estimates by aggregating energy at different structural levels that naturally arise from graph diffusion. In contrast to logit-based EBMs, we provably induce an integrable density in the data space by regularizing the energy function. We introduce an evidential interpretation of our EBM that significantly improves the predictive robustness of the GNN. Our framework is a simple and effective post hoc method applicable to any pre-trained GNN that is sensitive to various distribution shifts. It consistently achieves the best separation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution data on 6 out of 7 anomaly types while having the best average rank over shifts on *all* datasets.

Enhancing Graph Transformers with Hierarchical Distance Structural Encoding ðŸŒŸ
Graph transformers need strong inductive biases to derive meaningful attention scores. Yet, current methods often fall short in capturing longer ranges, hierarchical structures, or community structures, which are common in various graphs such as molecules, social networks, and citation networks. This paper presents a Hierarchical Distance Structural Encoding (HDSE) method to model node distances in a graph, focusing on its multi-level, hierarchical nature. We introduce a novel framework to seamlessly integrate HDSE into the attention mechanism of existing graph transformers, allowing for simultaneous application with other positional encodings. To apply graph transformers with HDSE to large-scale graphs, we further propose a high-level HDSE that effectively biases the linear transformers towards graph hierarchies. We theoretically prove the superiority of HDSE over shortest path distances in terms of expressivity and generalization. Empirically, we demonstrate that graph transformers with HDSE excel in graph classification, regression on 7 graph-level datasets, and node classification on 11 large-scale graphs, including those with up to a billion nodes. We provide our code in the supplementary and will make it publicly available upon acceptance.

Even Sparser Graph Transformers
Graph Transformers excel in long-range dependency modeling, but generally require quadratic memory complexity in the number of nodes in an input graph, and hence have trouble scaling to large graphs. Sparse attention variants such as Exphormer can help, but may require high-degree augmentations to the input graph for good performance, and do not attempt to sparsify an already-dense input graph. As the learned attention mechanisms tend to use few of these edges, however, such high-degree connections may be unnecessary. We show (empirically and with theoretical backing) that attention scores on graphs are usually quite consistent across network widths, and use this observation to propose a two-stage procedure, which we call Spexphormer: first, train a narrow network on the full augmented graph. Next, use only the active connections to train a wider network on a much sparser graph. We establish theoretical conditions when a narrow network's attention scores can match those of a wide network, and show that Spexphormer achieves good performance with drastically reduced memory requirements on various graph datasets.

Exploring Consistency in Graph Representations: from Graph Kernels to Graph Neural Networks
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant approach in graph representation learning, yet they often struggle to capture consistent similarity relationships among graphs.  To capture similarity relationships, while graph kernel methods like the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree (WL-subtree) and Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment (WLOA) perform effectively, they are heavily reliant on predefined kernels and lack sufficient non-linearities. Our work aims to bridge the gap between neural network methods and kernel approaches by enabling GNNs to consistently capture relational structures in their learned representations. Given the analogy between the message-passing process of GNNs and WL algorithms, we thoroughly compare and analyze the properties of WL-subtree and WLOA kernels. We find that the similarities captured by WLOA at different iterations are asymptotically consistent, ensuring that similar graphs remain similar in subsequent iterations, thereby leading to superior performance over the WL-subtree kernel. Inspired by these findings, we conjecture that the consistency in the similarities of graph representations across GNN layers is crucial in capturing relational structures and enhancing graph classification performance. Thus, we propose a loss to enforce the similarity of graph representations to be consistent across different layers. Our empirical analysis verifies our conjecture and shows that our proposed consistency loss can significantly enhance graph classification performance across several GNN backbones on various datasets.

Exploring the Role of Large Language Models in Prompt Encoding for Diffusion Models
Large language models~(LLMs)~based on decoder-only transformers have demonstrated superior text understanding capabilities compared to CLIP and T5-series models.However, the paradigm for utilizing current advanced LLMs in text-to-image diffusion models remains to be explored.We observed an unusual phenomenon: directly using a large language model as the prompt encoder significantly degrades the prompt-following ability in image generation.We identified two main obstacles behind this issue.One is the misalignment between the next token prediction training in LLM and the requirement for discriminative prompt features in diffusion models.The other is the intrinsic positional bias introduced by the decoder-only architecture.To deal with this issue, we propose a novel framework to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs.Through the carefully designed usage guidance, we effectively enhance the text representation capability of the LLM for prompt encoding and eliminate its inherent positional bias.This allows us to flexibly integrate state-of-the-art LLMs into the text-to-image generation model.Furthermore, we also provide an effective manner to fuse multiple LLMs into our framework.Considering the excellent performance and scaling capabilities demonstrated by the transformer architecture, we further design an LLM-Infused Diffusion Transformer(LI-DIT)based on the framework.We conduct extensive experiments to validate LI-DIT across model size and data size.Benefiting from the inherent ability of the LLMs and our innovative designs, the prompt understanding performance of  LI-DIT easily surpasses state-of-the-art open-source models as well as mainstream closed-source commercial models including Stable Diffusion 3, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney V6.

Finding Transformer Circuits With Edge Pruning
The path to interpreting a language model often proceeds via analysis of circuits---sparse computational subgraphs of the model that capture specific aspects of its behavior. Recent work has automated the task of discovering circuits. Yet, these methods have practical limitations, as they either rely on inefficient search algorithms or inaccurate approximations. In this paper, we frame circuit discovery as an optimization problem and propose _Edge Pruning_ as an effective and scalable solution. Edge Pruning leverages gradient-based pruning techniques, but instead of removing neurons or components, prunes the _edges_ between components. Our method finds circuits in GPT-2 that use less than half the number of edges than circuits found by previous methods while being equally faithful to the full model predictions on standard circuit-finding tasks. Edge Pruning is efficient on tasks involving up to 100,000 examples, outperforming previous methods in speed and producing substantially better circuits. It also perfectly recovers the ground-truth circuits in two models compiled with Tracr. Thanks to its efficiency, we scale Edge Pruning to CodeLlama-13B, a model over 100x the size of GPT-2.We use this setting for a case study, where we compare the mechanisms behind instruction prompting and in-context learning.We find two circuits with more than 99.96% sparsity that match the performance of the full model. Further analysis reveals that the mechanisms in the two settings overlap substantially. This shows that Edge Pruning is a practical and scalable tool for interpretability, which can shed light on behaviors that only emerge in large models.

FUG: Feature-Universal Graph Contrastive Pre-training for Graphs with Diverse Node Features
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), known for their effective graph encoding, are extensively used across various fields. Graph self-supervised pre-training, which self-supervisedly trains GNN encoders to generate high-quality graph representations, has garnered widespread attention. However, due to the inherent complex characteristics in graphs, GNNs encoders pre-trained on one dataset struggle to directly adapt to others that has different node feature shapes. This typically necessitates either model rebuilding or data alignment. The former results in non-transferability as each dataset need to rebuild a new model, while the latter brings serious knowledge loss since it forces features into a uniform shape by preprocessing such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To address this challenge, we propose a new Feature-Universal Graph contrastive pre-training strategy (FUG) that naturally avoids the need for model rebuilding and data reshaping. Specifically, inspired by discussions in existing work on the relationship between Contrastive Learning (CL) and PCA, we conduct a theoretical analysis and discover that PCA's optimization objectives is a special case of that in CL. We design an encoder with CL constraints to emulate PCA's generation of basis transformation matrix, which is utilized to losslessly adapt features in different datasets. Furthermore, we introduced a global uniformity constraint to replace negative sampling, reducing the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, and by explicitly defining positive samples, FUG avoids the substantial memory requirements of data augmentation. In cross domain experiments, FUG has performances close to the re-trained new models.

GC-Bench: An Open and Unified Benchmark for Graph Condensation ðŸŒŸ
Graph condensation (GC) has recently garnered considerable attention due to its ability to reduce large-scale graph datasets while preserving their essential properties. The core concept of GC is to create a smaller, more manageable graph that retains the characteristics of the original graph. Despite the proliferation of graph condensation methods developed in recent years, there is no comprehensive evaluation and in-depth analysis, which creates a great obstacle to understanding the progress in this field. To fill this gap, we develop a comprehensive Graph Condensation Benchmark (GC-Bench) to analyze the performance of graph condensation in different scenarios systematically. Specifically, GC-Bench systematically investigates the characteristics of graph condensation in terms of the following dimensions: effectiveness, transferability, and complexity. We comprehensively evaluate 12 state-of-the-art graph condensation algorithms in node-level and graph-level tasks and analyze their performance in 12 diverse graph datasets. Further, we have developed an easy-to-use library for training and evaluating different GC methods to facilitate reproducible research.The GC-Bench library is available at https://github.com/RingBDStack/GC-Bench.

GDeR: Safeguarding Efficiency, Balancing, and Robustness via Prototypical Graph Pruning ðŸŒŸ
Training high-quality deep models necessitates vast amounts of data, resulting in overwhelming computational and memory demands. Recently, data pruning, distillation, and coreset selection have been developed to streamline data volume by \textit{retaining}, \textit{synthesizing}, or \textit{selecting} a small yet informative subset from the full set. Among these methods, data pruning incurs the least additional training cost and offers the most practical acceleration benefits. However, it is the most vulnerable, often suffering significant performance degradation with imbalanced or biased data schema, thus raising concerns about its accuracy and reliability in on-device deployment. Therefore, there is a looming need for a new data pruning paradigm that maintains the efficiency of previous practices while ensuring balance and robustness.Unlike the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, where mature solutions have been developed to address these issues, graph neural networks (GNNs) continue to struggle with increasingly large-scale, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, lacking a unified dataset pruning solution. To achieve this, we introduce a novel dynamic soft-pruning method, \ourmethod, designed to update the training ``basket'' during the process using trainable prototypes. \ourmethod first constructs a well-modeled graph embedding hypersphere and then samples \textit{representative, balanced, and unbiased subsets} from this embedding space, which achieves the goal we called {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont \textbf{Graph Training Debugging}}.Extensive experiments on four datasets across three GNN backbones, demonstrate that \ourmethod (I) achieves or surpasses the performance of the full dataset with $30\%\sim50\%$ fewer training samples, (II) attains up to a $2.81\times$ lossless training speedup, and (III) outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in imbalanced training and noisy training scenarios by $0.3\%\sim4.3\%$ and $3.6\%\sim7.8\%$, respectively.

Generative Forests
We focus on generative AI for a type of data that still represent one of the most prevalent form of data: tabular data. We introduce a new powerful class of forest-based models fit for such tasks and a simple training algorithm with strong convergence guarantees in a boosting model that parallels that of the original weak / strong supervised learning setting. This algorithm can be implemented by a few tweaks to the most popular induction scheme for decision tree induction (*i.e. supervised learning*) with two classes. Experiments on the quality of generated data display substantial improvements compared to the state of the art. The losses our algorithm minimize and the structure of our models make them practical for related tasks that require fast estimation of a density given a generative model and an observation (even partially specified): such tasks include missing data imputation and density estimation. Additional experiments on these tasks reveal that our models can be notably good contenders to diverse state of the art methods, relying on models as diverse as (or mixing elements of) trees, neural nets, kernels or graphical models.

Generative Fractional Diffusion Models
We introduce the first continuous-time score-based generative model that leverages fractional diffusion processes for its underlying dynamics. Although diffusion models have excelled at capturing data distributions, they still suffer from various limitations such as slow convergence, mode-collapse on imbalanced data, and lack of diversity. These issues are partially linked to the use of light-tailed Brownian motion (BM) with independent increments. In this paper, we replace BM with an approximation of its non-Markovian counterpart, fractional Brownian motion (fBM), characterized by correlated increments and Hurst index $H \in (0,1)$, where $H=1/2$ recovers the classical BM. To ensure tractable inference and learning, we employ a recently popularized Markov approximation of fBM (MA-fBM) and derive its reverse time model, resulting in \emph{generative fractional diffusion models} (GFDM). We characterize the forward dynamics using a continuous reparameterization trick and propose an augmented score matching to efficiently learn the score-function, which is partly known in closed form, at minimal added cost. The ability to drive our diffusion model via fBM provides flexibility and control. $H<1/2$ enters the regime of \emph{rough paths} leading to diverse outcome whereas $H>1/2$ regularizes diffusion paths and invokes long-term memory as well as a heavy-tailed behaviour (super-diffusion). The Markov approximation allows added control by varying the number of Markov processes linearly combined to approximate fBM. Our evaluations on real image datasets demonstrate that GFDM achieves greater pixel-wise diversity and enhanced image quality, as indicated by a lower FID, offering a promising alternative to traditional diffusion models.

Generative Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection ðŸŒŸ
This work considers a practical semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) scenario, where part of the nodes in a graph are known to be normal, contrasting to the extensively explored unsupervised setting with a fully unlabeled graph. We reveal that having access to the normal nodes, even just a small percentage of normal nodes, helps enhance the detection performance of existing unsupervised GAD methods when they are adapted to the semi-supervised setting. However, their utilization of these normal nodes is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel Generative GAD approach (namely GGAD) for the semi-supervised scenario to better exploit the normal nodes. The key idea is to generate pseudo anomaly nodes, referred to as 'outlier nodes', for providing effective negative node samples in training a discriminative one-class classifier. The main challenge here lies in the lack of ground truth information about real anomaly nodes. To address this challenge, GGAD is designed to leverage two important priors about the anomaly nodes -- asymmetric local affinity and egocentric closeness -- to generate reliable outlier nodes that assimilate anomaly nodes in both graph structure and feature representations. Comprehensive experiments on six real-world GAD datasets are performed to establish a benchmark for semi-supervised GAD and show that GGAD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised GAD methods with varying numbers of training normal nodes.

Global Convergence in Training Large-Scale Transformers
Despite the widespread success of Transformers across various domains, their optimization guarantees in large-scale model settings are not well-understood. This paper rigorously analyzes the convergence properties of gradient flow in training Transformers with weight decay regularization. First, we construct the mean-field limit of large-scale Transformers, showing that as the model width and depth go to infinity, gradient flow converges to the Wasserstein gradient flow, which is represented by a partial differential equation. Then, we demonstrate that the gradient flow reaches a global minimum consistent with the PDE solution when the weight decay regularization parameter is sufficiently small. Our analysis is based on a series of novel mean-field techniques that adapt to Transformers. Compared with existing tools for deep networks (Lu et al., 2020) that demand homogeneity and global Lipschitz smoothness, we utilize a refined analysis assuming only $\textit{partial homogeneity}$ and $\textit{local Lipschitz smoothness}$. These new techniques may be of independent interest.

Globally Convergent Variational Inference ðŸŒŸ
In variational inference (VI), an approximation of the posterior distribution is selected from a family of distributions through numerical optimization. With the most common variational objective function, known as the evidence lower bound (ELBO), only convergence to a *local* optimum can be guaranteed. In this work, we instead establish the *global* convergence of a particular VI method. This VI method, which may be considered an instance of neural posterior estimation (NPE), minimizes an expectation of the inclusive (forward) KL divergence to fit a variational distribution that is parameterized by a neural network. Our convergence result relies on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to characterize the gradient dynamics that arise from considering the variational objective in function space. In the asymptotic regime of a fixed, positive-definite neural tangent kernel, we establish conditions under which the variational objective admits a unique solution in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Then, we show that the gradient descent dynamics in function space converge to this unique function. In ablation studies and practical problems, we demonstrate that our results explain the behavior of NPE in non-asymptotic finite-neuron settings, and show that NPE outperforms ELBO-based optimization, which often converges to shallow local optima.

GRANOLA: Adaptive Normalization for Graph Neural Networks
Despite the widespread adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), these models often incorporate off-the-shelf normalization layers like BatchNorm or InstanceNorm, which were not originally designed for GNNs. Consequently, these normalization layers may not effectively capture the unique characteristics of graph-structured data, potentially even weakening the expressive power of the overall architecture. While existing graph-specific normalization layers have been proposed, they often struggle to offer substantial and consistent benefits.In this paper, we propose GRANOLA, a novel graph-adaptive normalization layer. Unlike existing normalization layers, GRANOLA normalizes node features by adapting to the specific characteristics of the graph, particularly by generating expressive representations of its nodes, obtained by leveraging the propagation of Random Node Features (RNF) in the graph. We provide theoretical results that support our design choices as well as an extensive empirical evaluation demonstrating the superior performance of GRANOLA over existing normalization techniques. Furthermore, GRANOLA emerges as the top-performing method among all baselines in the same time complexity class of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs).

Graph Classification via Reference Distribution Learning: Theory and Practice
Graph classification is a challenging problem owing to the difficulty in quantifying the similarity between graphs or representing graphs as vectors, though there have been a few methods using graph kernels or graph neural networks (GNNs). Graph kernels often suffer from computational costs and manual feature engineering, while GNNs commonly utilize global pooling operations, risking the loss of structural or semantic information. This work introduces Graph Reference Distribution Learning (GRDL), an efficient and accurate graph classification method. GRDL treats each graph's latent node embeddings given by GNN layers as a discrete distribution, enabling direct classification without global pooling, based on maximum mean discrepancy to adaptively learned reference distributions. To fully understand this new model (the existing theories do not apply) and guide its configuration (e.g., network architecture, references' sizes, number, and regularization) for practical use, we derive generalization error bounds for GRDL and verify them numerically. More importantly, our theoretical and numerical results both show that GRDL has a stronger generalization ability than GNNs with global pooling operations. Experiments on moderate-scale and large-scale graph datasets show the superiority of GRDL over the state-of-the-art, emphasizing its remarkable efficiency, being at least 10 times faster than leading competitors in both training and inference stages.

Graph Coarsening with Message-Passing Guarantees ðŸŒŸ
Graph coarsening aims to reduce the size of a large graph while preserving some of its key properties, which has been used in many applications to reduce computational load and memory footprint. For instance, in graph machine learning, training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on coarsened graphs leads to drastic savings in time and memory. However, GNNs rely on the Message-Passing (MP) paradigm, and classical spectral preservation guarantees for graph coarsening do not directly lead to theoretical guarantees when performing naive message-passing on the coarsened graph.In this work, we propose a new message-passing operation specific to coarsened graphs, which exhibit theoretical guarantees on the preservation of the propagated signal. Interestingly, and in a sharp departure from previous proposals, this operation on coarsened graphs is oriented, even when the original graph is undirected. We conduct node classification tasks on synthetic and real data and observe improved results compared to performing naive message-passing on the coarsened graph.

GraphCroc: Cross-Correlation Autoencoder for Graph Structural Reconstruction ðŸŒŸ
Graph-structured data is integral to many applications, prompting the development of various graph representation methods. Graph autoencoders (GAEs), in particular, reconstruct graph structures from node embeddings. Current GAE models primarily utilize self-correlation to represent graph structures and focus on node-level tasks, often overlooking multi-graph scenarios. Our theoretical analysis indicates that self-correlation generally falls short in accurately representing specific graph features such as islands, symmetrical structures, and directional edges, particularly in smaller or multiple graph contexts.To address these limitations, we introduce a cross-correlation mechanism that significantly enhances the GAE representational capabilities. Additionally, we propose the GraphCroc, a new GAE that supports flexible encoder architectures tailored for various downstream tasks and ensures robust structural reconstruction, through a mirrored encoding-decoding process. This model also tackles the challenge of representation bias during optimization by implementing a loss-balancing strategy. Both theoretical analysis and numerical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology significantly outperforms existing self-correlation-based GAEs in graph structure reconstruction.

Graph Neural Networks and Arithmetic Circuits
We characterize the computational power of neural networks that follow the graph neural network (GNN) architecture, not restricted to aggregate-combine GNNs or other particular types. We establish an exact correspondence between the expressivity of GNNs using diverse activation functions and arithmetic circuits over real numbers. In our results the activation function of the network becomes a gate type in the circuit.  Our result holds for families of constant depth circuits and networks, both uniformly and non-uniformly, for all common activation functions.

Graph neural networks and non-commuting operators
Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of tasks which typically involve predicting features at the nodes of a graph. They are built from layers of graph convolutions which serve as a powerful inductive bias for describing the flow of information among the vertices. Often, more than one data modality is available. This work considers a setting in which several graphs have the same vertex set and a common node-level learning task. This generalizes standard GNN models to GNNs with several graph operators that do not commute. We may call this model graph-tuple neural networks (GtNN). In this work, we develop the mathematical theory to address the stability and transferability of GtNNs using properties of non-commuting non-expansive operators. We develop a limit theory of graphon-tuple neural networks and use it to prove a universal transferability theorem that guarantees that all graph-tuple neural networks are transferable on convergent graph-tuple sequences. In particular, there is no non-transferable energy under the convergence we consider here. Our theoretical results extend well-known transferability theorems for GNNs to the case of several simultaneous graphs (GtNNs) and provide a strict improvement on what is currently known even in the GNN case.We illustrate our theoretical results with simple experiments on synthetic data. To this end, we derive a training procedure that provably enforces the stability of the resulting model.

Graph Neural Networks Do Not Always Oversmooth ðŸŒŸ
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing relational data in applications. However, GNNs suffer from the problem of oversmoothing, the property that features of all nodes exponentially converge to the same vector over layers, prohibiting the design of deep GNNs. In this work we study oversmoothing in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by using their Gaussian process (GP) equivalence in the limit of infinitely many hidden features. By generalizing methods from conventional deep neural networks (DNNs), we can describe the distribution of features at the output layer of deep GCNs in terms of a GP: as expected, we find that typical parameter choices from the literature lead to oversmoothing. The theory, however, allows us to identify a new, non-oversmoothing phase: if the initial weights of the network have sufficiently large variance, GCNs do not oversmooth, and node features remain informative even at large depth. We demonstrate the validity of this prediction in finite-size GCNs by training a linear classifier on their output. Moreover, using the linearization of the GCN GP, we generalize the concept of propagation depth of information from DNNs to GCNs. This propagation depth diverges at the transition between the oversmoothing and non-oversmoothing phase. We test the predictions of our approach and find good agreement with finite-size GCNs. Initializing GCNs near the transition to the non-oversmoothing phase, we obtain networks which are both deep and expressive.

Graph Neural Networks Need Cluster-Normalize-Activate Modules ðŸŒŸ
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are non-Euclidean deep learning models for graph-structured data. Despite their successful and diverse applications, oversmoothing prohibits deep architectures due to node features converging to a single fixed point. This severely limits their potential to solve complex tasks. To counteract this tendency, we propose a plug-and-play module consisting of three steps: Clusterâ†’Normalizeâ†’Activate (CNA). By applying CNA modules, GNNs search and form super nodes in each layer, which are normalized and activated individually. We demonstrate in node classification and property prediction tasks that CNA significantly improves the accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Particularly, CNA reaches 94.18% and 95.75% accuracy on Cora and Citeseer, respectively. It further benefits GNNs in regression tasks as well, reducing the mean squared error compared to all baselines. At the same time, GNNs with CNA require substantially fewer learnable parameters than competing architectures.

Graph Structure Inference with BAM: Introducing the Bilinear Attention Mechanism ðŸŒŸ
Detecting dependencies among variables is a fundamental task across all scientific disciplines. In this work, we propose a novel neural network model for supervised graph structure inference, which aims to learn a mapping between observational data and their underlying dependence structure. The model is trained with variably shaped and coupled simulated input data and requires only a single forward pass through the trained network for inference. We introduce a novel bilinear attention mechanism (BAM) for explicit processing of dependency information, which operates on the level of covariance matrices of transformed data and respects the geometry of the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the robustness of our method in detecting a wide range of dependencies, excelling in undirected graph estimation and proving competitive in completed partially directed acyclic graph estimation through a novel two-step approach. The trained model demonstrates the ability to detect the presence of a causal relationships, regardless of their specific parameterizations.

Guiding a Diffusion Model with a Bad Version of Itself
The primary axes of interest in image-generating diffusion models are image quality, the amount of variation in the results, and how well the results align with a given condition, e.g., a class label or a text prompt. The popular classifier-free guidance approach uses an unconditional model to guide a conditional model, leading to simultaneously better prompt alignment and higher-quality images at the cost of reduced variation. These effects seem inherently entangled, and thus hard to control. We make the surprising observation that it is possible to obtain disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation by guiding generation using a smaller, less-trained version of the model itself rather than an unconditional model. This leads to significant improvements in ImageNet generation, setting record FIDs of 1.01 for 64x64 and 1.25 for 512x512, using publicly available networks. Furthermore, the method is also applicable to unconditional diffusion models, drastically improving their quality.

HC-GAE: The Hierarchical Cluster-based Graph Auto-Encoder for Graph Representation Learning ðŸŒŸ
Graph Auto-Encoders (GAEs) are powerful tools for graph representation learning. In this paper, we develop a novel Hierarchical Cluster-based GAE (HC-GAE), that can learn effective structural characteristics for graph data analysis. To this end, during the encoding process, we commence by utilizing the hard node assignment to decompose a sample graph into a family of separated subgraphs. We compress each subgraph into a coarsened node, transforming the original graph into a coarsened graph. On the other hand, during the decoding process, we adopt the soft node assignment to reconstruct the original graph structure by expanding the coarsened nodes. By hierarchically performing the above compressing procedure during the decoding process as well as the expanding procedure during the decoding process, the proposed HC-GAE can effectively extract bidirectionally hierarchical structural features of the original sample graph. Furthermore, we re-design the loss function that can integrate the information from either the encoder or the decoder. Since the associated graph convolution operation of the proposed HC-GAE is restricted in each individual separated subgraph and cannot propagate the node information between different subgraphs, the proposed HC-GAE can significantly reduce the over-smoothing problem arising in the classical convolution-based GAEs. The proposed HC-GAE can generate effective representations for either node classification or graph classification, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness on real-world datasets.

HGDL: Heterogeneous Graph Label Distribution Learning
Label Distribution Learning (LDL) has been commonly studied in computer visionand many other IID data applications, due to its more generic setting than single-label and multi-label classification. This paper advances LDL into graph domainsand aims to tackle a novel heterogeneous graph label distribution learning (HGDL)problem. We argue that the graph heterogeneity reflected on node types, nodeattributes, and neighborhood structures can impose significant challenges for gen-eralizing LDL onto graphs. To address the challenges, we propose a new learningframework with two key components: 1) proactive graph topology homogenization,and 2) topology and content consistency-aware graph transformer. Specifically,the former learns optimal information aggregation between meta-paths, so that thenode heterogeneity can be proactively addressed prior to the succeeding embeddinglearning; the latter uses transformer-like architecture to learn consistency betweenmeta-path and node attributes, allowing network topology and nodal attributes to beequally emphasized during the label distribution learning. By using KL-divergenceand additional constraints, HGDL delivers an end-to-end solution for learning andpredicting label distribution for nodes. Both theoretical and empirical studiessubstantiate the effectiveness of our HGDL approach. Our code and datasets areavailable at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HGDL-D014.

How many classifiers do we need?
As performance gains through scaling data or model size experience diminishing returns, it is becoming increasingly popular to turn to ensembling, where the predictions of multiple models are combined to improve accuracy. We focus on majority vote strategies in classification tasks, and take a deep dive into how the disagreement and the polarity, which we define in this paper, among agents relates to the performance gain achieved by aggregating individual agents. This paper addresses this in the following ways. 1) We define a quantity, $\eta$, that represents the polarity among agents within a dataset, and show both empirically and theoretically that this quantity is nearly constant for a dataset regardless of hyperparameters or architectures of classifiers. 2) We present a tight upper bound for the error of majority vote under restricted entropy conditions. This bound indicates that the disagreement is linearly correlated with the target, and the slope is linear in polarity, $\eta$. 3) We prove asymptotic behavior of disagreement in terms of the number of agents, which can help predicting the performance for a larger number of agents from that of a smaller number. Our theories and claims are supported by experiments on several image classification tasks with various types of neural networks.

HW-GPT-Bench: Hardware-Aware Architecture Benchmark for Language Models
The increasing size of language models necessitates a thorough analysis across multiple dimensions to assess trade-offs among crucial hardware metrics such as latency, energy consumption, GPU memory usage, and performance. Identifying optimal model configurations under specific hardware constraints is becoming essential but remains challenging due to the computational load of exhaustive training and evaluation on multiple devices. To address this, we introduce HW-GPT-Bench, a hardware-aware benchmark that utilizes surrogate predictions to approximate various hardware metrics across 13 devices of architectures in the GPT-2 family, with architectures containing up to 774M parameters. Our surrogates, via calibrated predictions and reliable uncertainty estimates, faithfully model the heteroscedastic noise inherent in the energy and latency measurements. To estimate perplexity, we employ weight-sharing techniques from Neural Architecture Search (NAS), inheriting pretrained weights from the largest GPT-2 model. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of HW-GPT-Bench by simulating optimization trajectories of various multi-objective optimization algorithms in just a few seconds.

Identifying General Mechanism Shifts in Linear Causal Representations
We consider the linear causal representation learning setting where we observe a linear mixing of $d$ unknown latent factors, which follow a linear structural causal model. Recent work has shown that it is possible to recover the latent factors as well as the underlying structural causal model over them, up to permutation and scaling, provided that we have at least $d$ environments, each of which corresponds to perfect interventions on a single latent node (factor). After this powerful result, a key open problem faced by the community has been to relax these conditions: allow for coarser than perfect single-node interventions, and allow for fewer than $d$ of them, since the number of latent factors $d$ could be very large. In this work, we consider precisely such a setting, where we allow a smaller than $d$ number of environments, and also allow for very coarse interventions that can very coarsely *change the entire causal graph over the latent factors*. On the flip side, we relax what we wish to extract to simply the *list of nodes that have shifted between one or more environments*. We provide a surprising identifiability result that it is indeed possible, under some very mild standard assumptions, to identify the set of shifted nodes. Our identifiability proof moreover is a constructive one: we explicitly provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a node to be a shifted node, and show that we can check these conditions given observed data. Our algorithm lends itself very naturally to the sample setting where instead of just interventional distributions, we are provided datasets of samples from each of these distributions. We corroborate our results on both synthetic experiments as well as an interesting psychometric dataset.

If You Want to Be Robust, Be Wary of Initialization ðŸŒŸ
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs, on a modelâ€™s robustness.We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between initial weights, number of training epochs and the modelâ€™s vulnerability, offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations, with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization approaches.

Initialization is Critical to Whether Transformers Fit Composite Functions by Inference or Memorizing
Transformers have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks, but their performance on compositional problems remains a topic of debate. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms of how transformers behave on unseen compositional tasks.  We discover that the parameter initialization scale plays a critical role in determining whether the model learns inferential solutions, which capture the underlying compositional primitives, or symmetric solutions, which simply memorize mappings without understanding the compositional structure. By analyzing the information flow and vector representations within the model, we reveal the distinct mechanisms underlying these solution types. We further find that inferential solutions exhibit low complexity bias, which we hypothesize is a key factor enabling them to learn individual mappings for single anchors. Building upon the understanding of these mechanisms, we can predict the learning behavior of models with different initialization scales when faced with data of varying complexity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of initialization scale in shaping the type of solution learned by transformers and their ability to learn and generalize compositional tasks.

InstructG2I: Synthesizing Images from Multimodal Attributed Graphs
In this paper, we approach an overlooked yet critical task Graph2Image: generating images from multimodal attributed graphs (MMAGs). This task poses significant challenges due to the explosion in graph size, dependencies among graph entities, and the need for controllability in graph conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a graph context-conditioned diffusion model called InstructG2I. InstructG2I first exploits the graph structure and multimodal information to conduct informative neighbor sampling by combining personalized page rank and re-ranking based on vision-language features. Then, a graph QFormer encoder adaptively encodes the graph nodes into an auxiliary set of graph prompts to guide the denoising process of diffusion. Finally, we propose graph classifier-free guidance, enabling controllable generation by varying the strength of graph guidance and multiple connected edges to a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our approach. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Graph2Image-submit-607E/.

Is One GPU Enough? Pushing Image Generation at Higher-Resolutions with Foundation Models.
In this work, we introduce Pixelsmith, a zero-shot text-to-image generative framework to sample images at higher resolutions with a single GPU. We are the first to show that it is possible to scale the output of a pre-trained diffusion model by a factor of 1000, opening the road to gigapixel image generation at no extra cost. Our cascading method uses the image generated at the lowest resolution as baseline to sample at higher resolutions. For the guidance, we introduce the Slider, a mechanism that fuses the overall structure contained in the first-generated image with enhanced fine details. At each inference step, we denoise patches rather than the entire latent space, minimizing memory demands so that a single GPU can handle the process, regardless of the image's resolution. Our experimental results show that this method not only achieves higher quality and diversity compared to existing techniques but also reduces sampling time and ablation artifacts.

Language Models as Hierarchy Encoders
Interpreting hierarchical structures latent in language is a key limitation of current language models (LMs). While previous research has implicitly leveraged these hierarchies to enhance LMs, approaches for their explicit encoding are yet to be explored. To address this, we introduce a novel approach to re-train transformer encoder-based LMs as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs), harnessing the expansive nature of hyperbolic space. Our method situates the output embedding space of pre-trained LMs within a PoincarÃ© ball with a curvature that adapts to the embedding dimension, followed by re-training on hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses. These losses are designed to effectively cluster related entities (input as texts) and organise them hierarchically. We evaluate HiTs against pre-trained LMs, standard fine-tuned LMs, and several hyperbolic embedding baselines, focusing on their capabilities in simulating transitive inference, predicting subsumptions, and transferring knowledge across hierarchies. The results demonstrate that HiTs consistently outperform all baselines in these tasks, underscoring the effectiveness and transferability of our re-trained hierarchy encoders.

Learning a Single Neuron Robustly to Distributional Shifts and Adversarial Label Noise ðŸŒŸ
We study the problem of learning a single neuron with respect to the $L_2^2$-loss in the presence of adversarial distribution shifts, where the labels can be arbitrary, and the goal is to find a "best-fit" function.More precisely, given training samples from a reference distribution $p_0$, the goal is to approximate the vector $\mathbf{w}^*$which minimizes the squared loss with respect to the worst-case distribution that is close in $\chi^2$-divergence to $p_{0}$.We design a computationally efficient algorithm that recovers a vector $ \hat{\mathbf{w}}$satisfying $\mathbb{E}\_{p^*} (\sigma(\hat{\mathbf{w}} \cdot \mathbf{x}) - y)^2 \leq C \hspace{0.2em}  \mathbb{E}\_{p^*} (\sigma(\mathbf{w}^* \cdot \mathbf{x}) - y)^2 + \epsilon$, where $C>1$ is a dimension-independent constant and $(\mathbf{w}^*, p^*)$ is the witness attaining the min-max risk$\min_{\mathbf{w}:\|\mathbf{w}\| \leq W} \max\_{p} \mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim p} (\sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) - y)^2 - \nu \chi^2(p, p_0)$.Our algorithm follows the primal-dual framework and is designed by directly bounding the risk with respect to the original, nonconvex $L_2^2$ loss.From an optimization standpoint, our work opens new avenues for the design of primal-dual algorithms under structured nonconvexity.

Learning Diffusion at Lightspeed ðŸŒŸ
Diffusion regulates a phenomenal number of natural processes and the dynamics of many successful generative models. Existing models to learn the diffusion terms from observational data rely on complex bilevel optimization problems and properly model only the drift of the system.We propose a new simple model, JKOnet*, which bypasses altogether the complexity of existing architectures while presenting significantly enhanced representational capacity: JKOnet* recovers the potential, interaction, and internal energy components of the underlying diffusion process. JKOnet* minimizes a simple quadratic loss, runs at lightspeed, and drastically outperforms other baselines in practice. Additionally, JKOnet* provides a closed-form optimal solution for linearly parametrized functionals. Our methodology is based on the interpretation of diffusion processes as energy-minimizing trajectories in the probability space via the so-called JKO scheme, which we study via its first-order optimality conditions, in light of few-weeks-old advancements in optimization in the probability space.

Learning Diffusion Priors from Observations by Expectation Maximization
Diffusion models recently proved to be remarkable priors for Bayesian inverse problems. However, training these models typically requires access to large amounts of clean data, which could prove difficult in some settings. In this work, we present a novel method based on the expectation-maximization algorithm for training diffusion models from incomplete and noisy observations only. Unlike previous works, our method leads to proper diffusion models, which is crucial for downstream tasks. As part of our method, we propose and motivate a new posterior sampling scheme for unconditional diffusion models. We present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our method.

Learning Discrete Concepts in Latent Hierarchical Models ðŸŒŸ
Learning concepts from natural high-dimensional data (e.g., images) holds potential in building human-aligned and interpretable machine learning models.    Despite its encouraging prospect, formalization and theoretical insights into this crucial task are still lacking.    In this work, we formalize concepts as discrete latent causal variables that are related via a hierarchical causal model that encodes different abstraction levels of concepts embedded in high-dimensional data (e.g., a dog breed and its eye shapes in natural images).    We formulate conditions to facilitate the identification of the proposed causal model, which reveals when learning such concepts from unsupervised data is possible.    Our conditions permit complex causal hierarchical structures beyond latent trees and multi-level directed acyclic graphs in prior work and can handle high-dimensional, continuous observed variables, which is well-suited for unstructured data modalities such as images.    We substantiate our theoretical claims with synthetic data experiments.    Further, we discuss our theory's implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of latent diffusion models and provide corresponding empirical evidence for our theoretical insights.

Learning from Noisy Labels via Conditional Distributionally Robust Optimization
While crowdsourcing has emerged as a practical solution for labeling extensive datasets, it presents a significant challenge in learning accurate models due to noisy labels contributed by annotators with diverse expertise. Existing approaches typically estimate the true label posterior conditional on the instance and noisy annotations to infer true labels or adjust loss functions. These estimates, however, ignore potential misspecification in the true label posterior, which can degrade model performances, particularly in scenarios with high noise ratios. To address this issue, we investigate learning from noisy annotations with estimated true label posterior through the lens of conditional distributionally robust optimization (CDRO). In particular, we propose formulating the problem as minimizing the worst-case risk within a distance-based ambiguity set centered around a reference distribution. By examining the strong duality of the formulation, we derive upper bounds for the worst-case risk. Additionally, we develop the analytical solution for the dual robust risk for each data point, which motivates a novel robust pseudo-label collection algorithm by leveraging the likelihood ratio test. This algorithm enables the construction of a pseudo-empirical distribution, serving as a more robust reference probability distribution in CDRO. Moreover, to devise an efficient algorithm for CDRO, we derive a closed-form expression for the empirical robust risk and the optimal Lagrange multiplier of the dual problem, facilitating a principled balance between robustness and model fitting. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Learning the Latent Causal Structure for Modeling Label Noise ðŸŒŸ
In learning with noisy labels, the noise transition matrix reveals how an instance relates from its clean label to its noisy label. Accurately estimating an instance's noise transition matrix is crucial for inferring its clean label. However, when only a noisy dataset is available, noise transition matrices can be estimated only for some "special" instances. To leverage these estimated transition matrices to help estimate transition matrices of other instances, it is essential to explore relations between the matrices of these "special" instances and those of the others.Existing studies usually build the relation by explicitly defining the similarity between the estimated noise transition matrices of "special" instances and those of other instances. However, these similarity-based assumptions are hard to validate and may not be aligned with real-world data. If these assumptions fail, noise transition matrices and clean labels cannot be accurately estimated.In this paper, we found that by learning the latent causal structure governing the generative process of noisy data, we can estimate noise transition matrices directly, eliminating the need for similarity-based assumptions. To achieve this, unlike previous generative label-noise learning methods, we consider causal influences between latent causal variables and model them with a learnable graphical model. Utilizing only noisy data, our method can effectively learn the latent causal structure. Experimental results on various label-noise datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in estimating noise transition matrices, which leads to the improvement of classification accuracy.

Leveraging Contrastive Learning for Enhanced Node Representations in Tokenized Graph Transformers ðŸŒŸ
While tokenized graph Transformers have demonstrated strong performance in node classification tasks, their reliance on a limited subset of nodes with high similarity scores for constructing token sequences overlooks valuable information from other nodes, hindering their ability to fully harness graph information for learning optimal node representations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph Transformer called GCFormer. Unlike previous approaches, GCFormer develops a hybrid token generator to create two types of token sequences, positive and negative, to capture diverse graph information. And a tailored Transformer-based backbone is adopted to learn meaningful node representations from these generated token sequences. Additionally, GCFormer introduces contrastive learning to extract valuable information from both positive and negative token sequences, enhancing the quality of learned node representations. Extensive experimental results across various datasets, including homophily and heterophily graphs, demonstrate the superiority of GCFormer in node classification, when compared to representative graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph Transformers.

LibMOON: A Gradient-based MultiObjective OptimizatioN Library in PyTorch ðŸŒŸ
Multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) are prevalent in machine learning, with applications in multi-task learning, learning under fairness or robustness constraints, etc. Instead of reducing multiple objective functions into a scalar objective, MOPs aim to optimize for the so-called Pareto optimality or Pareto set learning, which involves optimizing more than one objective function simultaneously, over models with millions of parameters. Existing benchmark libraries for MOPs mainly focus on evolutionary algorithms, most of which are zeroth-order methods that do not utilize higher-order information from multiple objectives and cannot scale to large-scale models with millions of parameters. In light of the above gap, this paper introduces \algoname, the first multiobjective optimization library that supports state-of-the-art gradient-based methods, provides a fair benchmark, and is open-sourced for the community.\footnote{\algoname~is available at \url{https://github.com/xzhang2523/libmoon} and can be installed via ``\texttt{pip install libmoon}''.

Likelihood-based differentiable structure learning ðŸŒŸ
Existing approaches to differentiable structure learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) rely on strong identifiability assumptions in order to guarantee that global minimizers of the acyclicity-constrained optimization problem identifies the true DAG. Moreover, it has been observed empirically that the optimizer may exploit undesirable artifacts in the loss function. We explain and remedy these issues by studying the behavior of differentiable acyclicity-constrained programs under general likelihoods with multiple global minimizers. By carefully regularizing the likelihood, it is possible to identify the sparsest model in the Markov equivalence class, even in the absence of an identifiable parametrization. We first study the Gaussian case in detail, showing how proper regularization of the likelihood defines a score that identifies the sparsest model. Assuming faithfulness, it also recovers the Markov equivalence class. These results are then generalized to general models and likelihoods, where the same claims hold. These theoretical results are validated empirically, showing how this can be done using standard gradient-based optimizers, thus paving the way for differentiable structure learning under general models and losses.

LiteVAE: Lightweight and Efficient Variational Autoencoders for Latent Diffusion Models ðŸŒŸ
Advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs) have revolutionized high-resolution image generation, but the design space of the autoencoder that is central to these systems remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LiteVAE, a family of autoencoders for LDMs that leverage the 2D discrete wavelet transform to enhance scalability and computational efficiency over standard variational autoencoders (VAEs) with no sacrifice in output quality.   We also investigate the training methodologies and the decoder architecture of LiteVAE and propose several enhancements that improve the training dynamics and reconstruction quality. Our base LiteVAE model matches the quality of the established VAEs in current LDMs with a six-fold reduction in encoder parameters, leading to faster training and lower GPU memory requirements, while our larger model outperforms VAEs of comparable complexity across all evaluated metrics (rFID, LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM).

Localizing Memorization in SSL Vision Encoders ðŸŒŸ
Recent work on studying memorization in self-supervised learning (SSL) suggests that even though SSL encoders are trained on millions of images, they still memorize individual data points. While effort has been put into characterizing the memorized data and linking encoder memorization to downstream utility, little is known about where the memorization happens inside SSL encoders. To close this gap, we propose two metrics for localizing memorization in SSL encoders on a per-layer (LayerMem) and per-unit basis (UnitMem). Our localization methods are independent of the downstream task, do not require any label information, and can be performed in a forward pass. By localizing memorization in various encoder architectures (convolutional and transformer-based) trained on diverse datasets with contrastive and non-contrastive SSL frameworks, we find that (1) while SSL memorization increases with layer depth, highly memorizing units are distributed across the entire encoder, (2) a significant fraction of units in SSL encoders experiences surprisingly high memorization of individual data points, which is in contrast to models trained under supervision, (3) atypical (or outlier) data points cause much higher layer and unit memorization than standard data points, and (4) in vision transformers, most memorization happens in the fully-connected layers. Finally, we show that localizing memorization in SSL has the potential to improve fine-tuning and to inform pruning strategies.

Local to Global: Learning Dynamics and Effect of Initialization for Transformers
In recent years, transformer-based models have revolutionized deep learning, particularly in sequence modeling. To better understand this phenomenon, there is a growing interest in using Markov input processes to study transformers. However, our current understanding in this regard remains limited with many fundamental questions about how transformers learn Markov chains still unanswered. In this paper, we address this by focusing on first-order Markov chains and single-layer transformers, providing a comprehensive characterization of the learning dynamics in this context. Specifically, we prove that transformer parameters trained on next-token prediction loss can either converge to global or local minima, contingent on the initialization and the Markovian data properties, and we characterize the precise conditions under which this occurs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind highlighting the role of initialization. We further demonstrate that our theoretical findings are corroborated by empirical evidence. Based on these insights, we provide guidelines for the initilization of transformer parameters and demonstrate their effectiveness. Finally, we outline several open problems in this arena.

Long-range Brain Graph Transformer
Understanding communication and information processing among brain regions of interest (ROIs) is highly dependent on long-range connectivity, which plays a crucial role in facilitating diverse functional neural integration across the entire brain. However, previous studies generally focused on the short-range dependencies within brain networks while neglecting the long-range dependencies, limiting an integrated understanding of brain-wide communication. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive Long-range aware TransformER (ALTER), a brain graph transformer to capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs utilizing biased random walk. Specifically, we present a novel long-range aware strategy to explicitly capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs. By guiding the walker towards the next hop with higher correlation value, our strategy simulates the real-world brain-wide communication. Furthermore, by employing the transformer framework, ALERT adaptively integrates both short- and long-range dependencies between brain ROIs, enabling an integrated understanding of multi-level communication across the entire brain. Extensive experiments on ABIDE and ADNI datasets demonstrate that ALTER consistently outperforms generalized state-of-the-art graph learning methods (including SAN, Graphormer, GraphTrans, and LRGNN) and other graph learning based brain network analysis methods (including FBNETGEN, BrainNetGNN, BrainGNN, and BrainNETTF) in neurological disease diagnosis.

Long-range Meta-path Search on Large-scale Heterogeneous Graphs ðŸŒŸ
Utilizing long-range dependency, a concept extensively studied in homogeneous graphs, remains underexplored in heterogeneous graphs, especially on large ones, posing two significant challenges: Reducing computational costs while maximizing effective information utilization in the presence of heterogeneity, and overcoming the over-smoothing issue in graph neural networks. To address this gap, we investigate the importance of different meta-paths and introduce an automatic framework for utilizing long-range dependency on heterogeneous graphs, denoted as Long-range Meta-path Search through Progressive Sampling (LMSPS). Specifically, we develop a search space with all meta-paths related to the target node type. By employing a progressive sampling algorithm, LMSPS dynamically shrinks the search space with hop-independent time complexity. Through a sampling evaluation strategy, LMSPS conducts a specialized and effective meta-path selection, leading to retraining with only effective meta-paths, thus mitigating costs and over-smoothing. Extensive experiments across diverse heterogeneous datasets validate LMSPS's capability in discovering effective long-range meta-paths, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LMSPS-BBEC.

Long-tailed Object Detection Pretraining: Dynamic Rebalancing Contrastive Learning with Dual Reconstruction
Although large-scale pretraining followed by downstream fine-tuning is a prevalent approach in object detection, it often underperforms on datasets with significant long-tailed distributions. Our investigation identifies biases originating not only from extreme imbalances in classifier weight norms but also from simplicity biases at the feature representation level. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel pretraining methodology, Dynamic Rebalancing Contrastive Learning with Dual Reconstruction (DRCL). This method seamlessly integrates holistic and object-level contrasts within a contrastive learning framework, utilizes a dynamic rebalancing technique that transitions from image-level to instance-level resampling, and implements a dual reconstruction strategy to preserve both natural appearance and internal semantic consistency. By synergistically combining self-supervised and supervised learning modalities, our approach substantially reduces pretraining time and resource demands. Demonstrating significant enhancements over traditional long-tailed detection methods, particularly for rare classes, our methodology achieves State-of-the-Art performance on the extensive LVIS dataset across multiple detection frameworks and backbone networks.

Non-convolutional graph neural networks. ðŸŒŸ
Rethink convolution-based graph neural networks (GNN)---they characteristically suffer from limited expressiveness, over-smoothing, and over-squashing, and require specialized sparse kernels for efficient computation.Here, we design a simple graph learning module entirely free of convolution operators, coined _random walk with unifying memory_ (RUM) neural network, where an RNN merges the topological and semantic graph features along the random walks terminating at each node.Relating the rich literature on RNN behavior and graph topology, we theoretically show and experimentally verify that RUM attenuates the aforementioned symptoms and is more expressive than the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) isomorphism test.On a variety of node- and graph-level classification and regression tasks, RUM not only achieves competitive performance, but is also robust, memory-efficient, scalable, and faster than the simplest convolutional GNNs.

On the Expressivity and Sample Complexity of Node-Individualized Graph Neural Networks
Graph neural networks (GNNs) employing message passing for graph classification are inherently limited by the expressive power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test for graph isomorphism. Node individualization schemes, which assign unique identifiers to nodes (e.g., by adding random noise to features), are a common approach for achieving universal expressiveness. However, the ability of GNNs endowed with individualization schemes to generalize beyond the training data is still an open question. To address this question, this paper presents a theoretical analysis of the sample complexity of such GNNs from a statistical learning perspective, employing Vapnikâ€“Chervonenkis dimension and covering number bounds. We demonstrate that node individualization schemes that are permutation-equivariant and robust to minor input perturbations result in lower sample complexity, and design novel individualization schemes that exploit these results. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated experimentally on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

On the Impact of Feature Heterophily on Link Prediction with Graph Neural Networks ðŸŒŸ
Heterophily, or the tendency of connected nodes in networks to have different class labels or dissimilar features, has been identified as challenging for many Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. While the challenges of applying GNNs for node classification when class labels display strong heterophily are well understood, it is unclear how heterophily affects GNN performance on other important graph learning tasks where class labels are not available. In this work, we focus on the link prediction task and systematically analyze the impact of heterophily in node features on GNN performance. Theoretically, we first introduce formal definitions of homophilic and heterophilic link prediction tasks, and present a theoretical framework that highlights the different optimizations needed for the respective tasks. We then analyze how different link prediction encoders and decoders adapt to varying levels of feature homophily and introduce designs for improved performance. Our empirical analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets confirms our theoretical insights and highlights the importance of adopting learnable decoders and GNN encoders with ego- and neighbor-embedding separation in message passing for link prediction tasks beyond homophily.

On the Robustness of Spectral Algorithms for Semirandom Stochastic Block Models
In a graph bisection problem, we are given a graph $G$ with two equally-sized unlabeled communities, and the goal is to recover the vertices in these communities. A popular heuristic, known as spectral clustering, is to output an estimated community assignment based on the eigenvector corresponding to the second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of $G$. Spectral algorithms can be shown to provably recover the cluster structure for graphs generated from probabilistic models, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). However, spectral clustering is known to be non-robust to model mis-specification. Techniques based on semidefinite programming have been shown to be more robust, but they incur significant computational overheads. In this work, we study the robustness of spectral algorithms against semirandom adversaries. Informally, a semirandom adversary is allowed to ``helpfully'' change the specification of the model in a way that is consistent with the ground-truth solution. Our semirandom adversaries in particular are allowed to add edges inside clusters or increase the probability that an edge appears inside a cluster. Semirandom adversaries are a useful tool to determine the extent to which an algorithm has overfit to statistical assumptions on the input. On the positive side, we identify a wide range of semirandom adversaries under which spectral bisection using the _unnormalized_ Laplacian is strongly consistent, i.e., it exactly recovers the planted partitioning. On the negative side, we show that in many of these settings, _normalized_ spectral bisection outputs a partitioning that makes a classification mistake on a constant fraction of the vertices. Finally, we demonstrate numerical experiments that complement our theoretical findings.

Position Coupling: Leveraging Task Structure for Improved Length Generalization of Transformers
Even for simple arithmetic tasks like integer addition, it is challenging for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training.To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer.Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more "relevant" tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position.On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to *200-digit* additions (6.67x of the trained length).On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it.We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as Nx2 multiplication and a two-dimensional task.

PowerGraph: A power grid benchmark dataset for graph neural networks
Power grids are critical infrastructures of paramount importance to modern society and, therefore, engineered to operate under diverse conditions and failures. The ongoing energy transition poses new challenges for the decision-makers and system operators. Therefore, we must develop grid analysis algorithms to ensure reliable operations. These key tools include power flow analysis and system security analysis, both needed for effective operational and strategic planning. The literature review shows a growing trend of machine learning (ML) models that perform these analyses effectively. In particular, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) stand out in such applications because of the graph-based structure of power grids. However, there is a lack of publicly available graph datasets for training and benchmarking ML models in electrical power grid applications. First, we present PowerGraph, which comprises GNN-tailored datasets for i) power flows, ii) optimal power flows, and iii) cascading failure analyses of power grids. Second, we provide ground-truth explanations for the cascading failure analysis. Finally, we perform a complete benchmarking of GNN methods for node-level and graph-level tasks and explainability. Overall, PowerGraph is a multifaceted GNN dataset for diverse tasks that includes power flow and fault scenarios with real-world explanations, providing a valuable resource for developing improved GNN models for node-level, graph-level tasks and explainability methods in power system modeling. The dataset is available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PowerGraph/22820534 and the code at https://github.com/PowerGraph-Datasets.

Preventing Dimensional Collapse in Self-Supervised Learning via Orthogonality Regularization ðŸŒŸ
Self-supervised learning (SSL) has rapidly advanced in recent years, approaching the performance of its supervised counterparts through the extraction of representations from unlabeled data. However, dimensional collapse, where a few large eigenvalues dominate the eigenspace, poses a significant obstacle for SSL. When dimensional collapse occurs on features (e.g. hidden features and representations), it prevents features from representing the full information of the data; when dimensional collapse occurs on weight matrices, their filters are self-related and redundant, limiting their expressive power.Existing studies have predominantly concentrated on the dimensional collapse of representations, neglecting whether this can sufficiently prevent the dimensional collapse of the weight matrices and hidden features. To this end, we first time propose a mitigation approach employing orthogonal regularization (OR) across the encoder, targeting both convolutional and linear layers during pretraining. OR promotes orthogonality within weight matrices, thus safeguarding against the dimensional collapse of weight matrices, hidden features, and representations. Our empirical investigations demonstrate that OR significantly enhances the performance of SSL methods across diverse benchmarks, yielding consistent gains with both CNNs and Transformer-based architectures.

Probabilistic Graph Rewiring via Virtual Nodes ðŸŒŸ
Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph-based machine learning. Despite their effectiveness, MPNNs face challenges such as under-reaching and over-squashing, where limited receptive fields and structural bottlenecks hinder information flow in the graph. While graph transformers hold promise in addressing these issues, their scalability is limited due to quadratic complexity regarding the number of nodes, rendering them impractical for larger graphs. Here, we propose implicitly rewired message-passing neural networks (IPR-MPNNs), a novel approach that integrates implicit probabilistic graph rewiring into MPNNs. By introducing a small number of virtual nodes, i.e., adding additional nodes to a given graph and connecting them to existing nodes, in a differentiable, end-to-end manner, IPR-MPNNs enable long-distance message propagation, circumventing quadratic complexity. Theoretically, we demonstrate that IPR-MPNNs surpass the expressiveness of traditional MPNNs.  Empirically, we validate our approach by showcasing its ability to mitigate under-reaching and over-squashing effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple graph datasets. Notably, IPR-MPNNs outperform graph transformers while maintaining significantly faster computational efficiency.

Prospective Learning: Learning for a Dynamic Future
In real world applications, the distribution of the data and our goals, evolve over time. And we therefore care about performance over time, rather than just instantaneous performance. Yet, the prevailing theoretical framework in artificial intelligence (AI) is probably approximately correct (PAC), which ignores time. Existing strategies to address the dynamic nature of distributions and goals have typically not treated time formally, but rather, heuristically. We therefore enrich PAC learning to by assuming the data are sampled from a stochastic process, rather than a random variable, and adjust the loss accordingly. This generalizes the notion of learning to something we call "prospective learning". We prove that time-agnostic empirical risk minimization cannot solve certain trivially simple prospective learning problems. We then prove that a simple time-aware augmentation to empirical risk minimization provably solves certain prospective learning problems. Numerical experiments illustrate that a few different ways of incorporating time, including modifications of a transformer, lead to improved algorithms for prospective learning, including visual recognition tasks constructed from MNIST and CIFAR. This framework offers a conceptual link towards both (i) improving AI solutions for currently intractable problems, and (ii) better characterizing the naturally intelligent systems that solve them.

PSL: Rethinking and Improving Softmax Loss from Pairwise Perspective for Recommendation
Softmax Loss (SL) is widely applied in Recommender Systems (RS) and has demonstrated effectiveness. This work analyzes SL from a pairwise perspective, revealing two significant limitations: 1) the relationship between SL and conventional ranking metrics like DCG is not sufficiently tight; 2) SL is highly sensitive to false negative instances. Our analysis indicates that these limitations are primarily due to the use of the exponential function.To address these issues, this work extends SL to a new family of loss functions, termed Pairwise Softmax Loss (PSL), which replaces exponential function in SL with other appropriate activation functions. While the revision is light, we highlight three merits of PSL: 1) it serves as a tighter surrogate for DCG with suitable activations; 2) it better balances data contributions; and 3) it acts as a specific BPR loss enhanced by Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO). We further validate the effectiveness and robustness of PSL through empirical experiments.

Pure Message Passing Can Estimate Common Neighbor for Link Prediction ðŸŒŸ
Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have emerged as the {\em de facto} standard in graph representation learning. However, when it comes to link prediction, they are not always superior to simple heuristics such as Common Neighbor (CN). This discrepancy stems from a fundamental limitation: while MPNNs excel in node-level representation, they stumble with encoding the joint structural features essential to link prediction, like CN. To bridge this gap, we posit that, by harnessing the orthogonality of input vectors, pure message-passing can indeed capture joint structural features. Specifically, we study the proficiency of MPNNs in approximating CN heuristics. Based on our findings, we introduce the Message Passing Link Predictor (MPLP), a novel link prediction model. MPLP taps into quasi-orthogonal vectors to estimate link-level structural features, all while preserving the node-level complexities. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets from various domains, where our method consistently outperforms the baseline methods, establishing new state-of-the-arts.

QUEST: Quadruple Multimodal Contrastive Learning with Constraints and Self-Penalization
Multimodal contrastive learning (MCL) has recently demonstrated significant success across various tasks. However, the existing MCL treats all negative samples equally and ignores the potential semantic association with positive samples, which limits the model's ability to achieve fine-grained alignment. In multi-view scenarios, MCL tends to prioritize shared information while neglecting modality-specific unique information across different views, leading to feature suppression and suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel contrastive framework named QUEST: Quadruple Multimodal Contrastive Learning with Constraints and Self-Penalization. In the QUEST framework, we propose quaternion contrastive objectives and orthogonal constraints to extract sufficient unique information. Meanwhile, a shared information-guided penalization is introduced to ensure that shared information does not excessively influence the optimization of unique information. Our method leverages quaternion vector spaces to simultaneously optimize shared and unique information. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our method achieves superior performance in multimodal contrastive learning benchmarks. On public benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, and on synthetic shortcut datasets, we outperform existing baseline methods by an average of $97.95\%$ on the CLIP model.

RAGraph: A General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning Framework
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in interpreting relational data across various domains, yet, they often struggle to generalize to unseen graph data that differs markedly from training instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability.

Resfusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Restoration Based on Prior Residual Noise
Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model will be available.

Rethinking Deep Thinking
Iterative algorithms solve problems by taking steps until a solution is reached. Models in the form of Deep Thinking (DT) networks have been demonstrated to learn iterative algorithms in a way that can scale to different sized problems at inference time using recurrent computation and convolutions. However, they are often unstable during training, and have no guarantees of convergence/termination at the solution. This paper addresses the problem of instability by analyzing the growth in intermediate representations, allowing us to build models (referred to as Deep Thinking with Lipschitz Constraints (DT-L)) with many fewer parameters and providing more reliable solutions. Additionally our DT-L formulation provides guarantees of convergence of the learned iterative procedure to a unique solution at inference time. We demonstrate DT-L is capable of robustly learning algorithms which extrapolate to harder problems than in the training set. We benchmark on the traveling salesperson problem to evaluate the capabilities of the modified system in an NP-hard problem where DT fails to learn.

Rethinking Weight Decay for Robust Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models
Modern optimizers such as AdamW, equipped with momentum and adaptive learning rate, are designed to escape local minima and explore the vast parameter space. This exploration is beneficial for finding good loss basins when training from scratch. It is not necessarily ideal when resuming from a powerful foundation model because it can lead to large deviations from the pre-trained initialization and, consequently, worse robustness and generalization. At the same time, strong regularization on all parameters can lead to under-fitting. We hypothesize that selectively regularizing the parameter space is the key to fitting and retraining the pre-trained knowledge. This paper proposes a new weight decay technique, Selective Projection Decay (SPD), that selectively imposes a strong penalty on certain layers while allowing others to change freely. Intuitively, SPD expands and contracts the parameter search space for layers with consistent and inconsistent loss reduction, respectively. Experimentally, when equipped with SPD, Adam consistently provides better in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution robustness performance on multiple popular vision and language benchmarks.

Revisiting, Benchmarking and Understanding Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation ðŸŒŸ
Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) involves the transfer of knowledge from a label-rich source graph to an unlabeled target graph under domain discrepancies. Despite the proliferation of methods designed for this emerging task, the lack of standard experimental settings and fair performance comparisons makes it challenging to understand which and when models perform well across different scenarios. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for unsupervised graph domain adaptation named GDABench, which encompasses 16 algorithms across 5 datasets with 74 adaptation tasks. Through extensive experiments, we observe that the performance of current UGDA models varies significantly across different datasets and adaptation scenarios. Specifically, we recognize that when the source and target graphs face significant distribution shifts, it is imperative to formulate strategies to effectively address and mitigate graph structural shifts. We also find that with appropriate neighbourhood aggregation mechanisms, simple GNN variants can even surpass state-of-the-art UGDA baselines. To facilitate reproducibility, we have developed an easy-to-use library PyGDA for training and evaluating existing UGDA methods, providing a standardized platform in this community. Our source codes and datasets can be found at https://github.com/pygda-team/pygda.

Revisiting Self-Supervised Heterogeneous Graph Learning from Spectral Clustering Perspective
Self-supervised heterogeneous graph learning (SHGL) has shown promising potential in diverse scenarios. However,  while existing SHGL methods share a similar essential with clustering approaches, they encounter two significant limitations: (i) noise in graph structures is often introduced during the message-passing process to weaken node representations, and (ii) cluster-level information may be inadequately captured and leveraged, diminishing the performance in downstream tasks. In this paper, we address these limitations by theoretically revisiting SHGL from the spectral clustering perspective and introducing a novel framework enhanced by rank and dual consistency constraints. Specifically, our framework incorporates a rank-constrained spectral clustering method that refines the affinity matrix to exclude noise effectively. Additionally, we integrate node-level and cluster-level consistency constraints that concurrently capture invariant and clustering information to facilitate learning in downstream tasks. We theoretically demonstrate that the learned representations are divided into distinct partitions based on the number of classes and exhibit enhanced generalization ability across tasks. Experimental results affirm the superiority of our method, showcasing remarkable improvements in several downstream tasks compared to existing methods.

Revive Re-weighting in Imbalanced Learning by Density Ratio Estimation ðŸŒŸ
In deep learning contexts, model performance often degrades significantly when trained on heavily imbalanced datasets, particularly when the evaluation metrics necessitate robust generalization across infrequently represented classes. In addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced data distributions in machine learning, this study introduces a novel approach that employs the method of density ratio estimation for dynamic class weight adjustment during model training, an innovative method we refer to as Re-weighting with Density Ratio (RDR). Our approach enables real-time adjustment of the importance of each class during the training process, mitigating overfitting on majority classes and enhancing adaptability across diverse datasets. Extensive experiments conducted on various large scale benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach. Results demonstrate substantial improvements in generalization capabilities, particularly under severely imbalanced condition.

Robust Graph Neural Networks via Unbiased Aggregation
The adversarial robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been questioned due to the false sense of security uncovered by strong adaptive attacks despite the existence of numerous defenses.In this work, we delve into the robustness analysis of representative robust GNNs and provide a unified robust estimation point of view tounderstand their robustness and limitations.Our novel analysis of estimation bias motivates the design of a robust and unbiased graph signal estimator. We then develop an efficient Quasi-Newton Iterative Reweighted Least Squares algorithm to solve the estimation problem, which is unfolded as robust unbiased aggregation layers in GNNs with theoretical guarantees.Our comprehensive experiments confirm the strong robustness of our proposed model under various scenarios, and the ablation study provides a deep understanding of its advantages.

Robust Offline Active Learning on Graphs
We consider the problem of active learning on graphs, which has crucial applications in many real-world networks where labeling node responses is expensive. In this paper, we propose an offline active learning method that selects nodes to query by explicitly incorporating information from both the network structure and node covariates. Building on graph signal recovery theories and the random spectral sparsification technique, the proposed method adopts a two-stage biased sampling strategy that takes both informativeness and representativeness into consideration for node querying. Informativeness refers to the complexity of graph signals that are learnable from the responses of queried nodes, while representativeness refers to the capacity of queried nodes to control generalization errors given noisy node-level information. We establish a theoretical relationship between generalization error and the number of nodes selected by the proposed method. Our theoretical results demonstrate the trade-off between informativeness and representativeness in active learning.  Extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed method is competitive with existing graph-based active learning methods, especially when node covariates and responses contain noises. Additionally, the proposed method is applicable to both regression and classification tasks on graphs.

Robust Reinforcement Learning with General Utility
Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem with general utility is a powerful decision making framework that covers standard RL with cumulative cost, exploration problems and demonstration learning. Existing works on RL with general utility do not consider robustness under environmental perturbation, which is important to adapt RL system to the real-world environment that differs from the training environment. To train a robust policy, we propose a robust RL framework with general utility. For popular convex utility functions which yield a nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization problem, we design a two-phase stochastic policy gradient based algorithm and obtain its sample complexity result for gradient convergence. Furthermore, for convex utility on a widely used polyhedral ambiguity set, we design an algorithm and obtain its convergence rate to a global optimal solution. Finally, we also design algorithms with provable gradient convergence for concave utilities and utilities that satisfy weak Minty variational inequality.

Scale Equivariant Graph Meta Networks
This paper pertains to an emerging machine learning paradigm: learning higher- order functions, i.e. functions whose inputs are functions themselves, particularly when these inputs are Neural Networks (NNs). With the growing interest in architectures that process NNs, a recurring design principle has permeated the field: adhering to the permutation symmetries arising from the connectionist structure ofNNs. However, are these the sole symmetries present in NN parameterizations? Zooming into most practical activation functions (e.g. sine, ReLU, tanh) answers this question negatively and gives rise to intriguing new symmetries, which we collectively refer to as scaling symmetries, that is, non-zero scalar multiplications and divisions of weights and biases. In this work, we propose Scale Equivariant Graph MetaNetworks - ScaleGMNs, a framework that adapts the Graph Metanetwork (message-passing) paradigm by incorporating scaling symmetries and thus rendering neuron and edge representations equivariant to valid scalings. We introduce novel building blocks, of independent technical interest, that allow for equivariance or invariance with respect to individual scalar multipliers or their product and use them in all components of ScaleGMN. Furthermore, we prove that, under certain expressivity conditions, ScaleGMN can simulate the forward and backward pass of any input feedforward neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method advances the state-of-the-art performance for several datasets and activation functions, highlighting the power of scaling symmetries asan inductive bias for NN processing.

Schur Nets: exploiting local structure for equivariance in higher order graph neural networks ðŸŒŸ
Several recent works have shown that extending the message passing paradigm to subgraphs communicating with other subgraphs, especially via higher order messages, can boost the expressivity of graph neural networks. In such architectures, to faithfully account for local structure such as cycles, the local operations must be equivariant to the automorphism group of the local environment. However, enumerating the automorphism groups of all possible subgraphs of interest and finding appropriate equivariant operations for each one of them separately is hardly feasible. In this paper we propose a solution to this problem based on spectral graph theory that bypasses having to determine the automorphism group entirely and constructs a basis for equivariant operations directly from the graph Laplacian. We show that empirically this approach can boost the performance of GNNs.

Self-Guided Masked Autoencoder ðŸŒŸ
Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly early stages of pre-training. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Sequential Signal Mixing Aggregation for Message Passing Graph Neural Networks
Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPGNNs) have emerged as the preferred method for modeling complex interactions across diverse graph entities. While the theory of such models is well understood, their aggregation module has not received sufficient attention. Sum-based aggregators have solid theoretical foundations regarding their separation capabilities. However, practitioners often prefer using more complex aggregations and mixtures of diverse aggregations. In this work, we unveil a possible explanation for this gap. We claim that sum-based aggregators fail to "mix" features belonging to distinct neighbors, preventing them from succeeding at downstream tasks.To this end, we introduce \aggname (\aggnameabbrv), a novel plug-and-play aggregation for MPGNNs. \aggnameabbrv treats the neighbor features as 2D discrete signals and sequentially convolves them, inherently enhancing the ability to mix features attributed to distinct neighbors. By performing extensive experiments, we show that when combining \aggnameabbrv with well-established MPGNN architectures, we achieve substantial performance gains across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results in many settings.We published our code at \githubrepo

Similarity-Navigated Conformal Prediction for Graph Neural Networks ðŸŒŸ
Graph Neural Networks have achieved remarkable accuracy in semi-supervised node classification tasks. However, these results lack reliable uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction methods provide a theoretical guarantee for node classification tasks, ensuring that the conformal prediction set contains the ground-truth label with a desired probability (e.g., 95\%). In this paper, we empirically show that for each node, aggregating the non-conformity scores of nodes with the same label can improve the efficiency of conformal prediction sets. This observation motivates us to propose a novel algorithm named $\textit{Similarity-Navigated Adaptive Prediction Sets}$ (SNAPS), which aggregates the non-conformity scores based on feature similarity and structural neighborhood. The key idea behind SNAPS is that nodes with high feature similarity or direct connections tend to have the same label. By incorporating adaptive similar nodes information, SNAPS can generate compact prediction sets and increase the singleton hit ratio (correct prediction sets of size one). Moreover, we theoretically provide a finite-sample coverage guarantee of SNAPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SNAPS, improving the efficiency of prediction sets and singleton hit ratio while maintaining valid coverage.

Simple and Fast Distillation of Diffusion Models
Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated their powerful performance across various tasks, but this comes at a cost of the slow sampling speed. To achieve both efficient and high-quality synthesis, various distillation-based accelerated sampling methods have been developed recently. However, they generally require time-consuming fine tuning with elaborate designs to achieve satisfactory performance in a specific number of function evaluation (NFE), making them difficult to employ in practice. To address this issue, we propose **S**imple and **F**ast **D**istillation (SFD) of diffusion models, which simplifies the paradigm used in existing methods and largely shortens their fine-tuning time up to $1000\times$. We begin with a vanilla distillation-based sampling method and boost its performance to state of the art by identifying and addressing several small yet vital factors affecting the synthesis efficiency and quality. Our method can also achieve sampling with variable NFEs using a single distilled model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFD strikes a good balance between the sample quality and fine-tuning costs in few-step image generation task. For example, SFD achieves 4.53 FID (NFE=2) on CIFAR-10 with only **0.64 hours** of fine-tuning on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.

SpeAr: A Spectral Approach for Zero-Shot Node Classification
Zero-shot node classification is a vital task in the field of graph data processing, aiming to identify nodes of classes unseen during the training process. Prediction bias is one of the primary challenges in zero-shot node classification, referring to the model's propensity to misclassify nodes of unseen classes as seen classes. However, most methods introduce external knowledge to mitigate the bias, inadequately leveraging the inherent cluster information within the unlabeled nodes. To address this issue, we employ spectral analysis coupled with learnable class prototypes to discover the implicit cluster structures within the graph, providing a more comprehensive understanding of classes. In this paper, we propose a spectral approach for zero-shot node classification (SpeAr). Specifically, we establish an approximate relationship between minimizing the spectral contrastive loss and performing spectral decomposition on the graph, thereby enabling effective node characterization through loss minimization. Subsequently, the class prototypes are iteratively refined based on the learned node representations, initialized with the semantic vectors. Finally, extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the SpeAr, which can further alleviate the bias problem.

Spectral Graph Pruning Against Over-Squashing and Over-Smoothing ðŸŒŸ
Message Passing Graph Neural Networks are known to suffer from two problems that are sometimes believed to be diametrically opposed: over-squashing and over-smoothing. The former results from topological bottlenecks that hamper the information flow from distant nodes and are mitigated by spectral gap maximization, primarily, by means of edge additions. However, such additions often promote over-smoothing that renders nodes of different classes less distinguishable. Inspired by the Braess phenomenon, we argue that deleting edges can address over-squashing and over-smoothing simultaneously. This insight explains how edge deletions can improve generalization, thus connecting spectral gap optimization to a seemingly disconnected objective of reducing computational resources by pruning graphs for lottery tickets. To this end, we propose a computationally effective spectral gap optimization framework to add or delete edges and demonstrate its effectiveness on the long range graph benchmark and on larger heterophilous datasets.

Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models
Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising interpretable method whose final prediction is based on intermediate, human-understandable concepts rather than the raw input. Through time-consuming manual interventions, a user can correct wrongly predicted concept values to enhance the model's downstream performance. We propose *Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models* (SCBMs), a novel approach that models concept dependencies. In SCBMs, a single-concept intervention affects all correlated concepts, thereby improving intervention effectiveness. Unlike previous approaches that model the concept relations via an autoregressive structure, we introduce an explicit, distributional parameterization that allows SCBMs to retain the CBMs' efficient training and inference procedure. Additionally, we leverage the parameterization to derive an effective intervention strategy based on the confidence region. We show empirically on synthetic tabular and natural image datasets that our approach improves intervention effectiveness significantly. Notably, we showcase the versatility and usability of SCBMs by examining a setting with CLIP-inferred concepts, alleviating the need for manual concept annotations.

Stochastic Kernel Regularisation Improves Generalisation in Deep Kernel Machines ðŸŒŸ
Recent work developed convolutional deep kernel machines, achieving 92.7\% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 using a ResNet-inspired architecture, which is SOTA for kernel methods. However, this still lags behind neural networks, which easily achieve over 94\% test accuracy with similar architectures. In this work we introduce several modifications to improve the convolutional deep kernel machine's generalisation, including stochastic kernel regularisation, which adds noise to the learned Gram matrices during training. The resulting model achieves 94.5\% test accuracy on CIFAR-10. This finding has important theoretical and practical implications, as it demonstrates that the ability to perform well on complex tasks like image classification is not unique to neural networks. Instead, other approaches including deep kernel methods can achieve excellent performance on such tasks, as long as they have the capacity to learn representations from data.

Stopping Bayesian Optimization with Probabilistic Regret Bounds
Bayesian optimization is a popular framework for efficiently finding high-quality solutions to difficult problems based on limited information. As a rule, these algorithms operate by iteratively choosing what to try next until some predefined budget has been exhausted. We investigate replacing this de facto stopping rule with criteria based on the probability that a point satisfies a given set of conditions.As a prototypical example, we focus on an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-criterion: stop when a solution has been found whose value is within $\epsilon > 0$ of the optimum with probability at least $1 - \delta$ under the model. For Gaussian process priors, we prove that Bayesian optimization satisfies this criterion under mild technical assumptions. Further, we give a practical algorithm for evaluating stopping rules with Monte Carlo estimators in a manner that is robust to estimation error. These findings are accompanied by empirical results which demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.

SubgDiff: A Subgraph Diffusion Model to Improve Molecular Representation Learning ðŸŒŸ
Molecular representation learning has shown great success in advancing AI-based drug discovery. A key insight of many recent works is that the 3D geometric structure of molecules provides essential information about their physicochemical properties. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have achieved impressive performance in molecular 3D conformation generation.  However, most existing molecular diffusion models treat each atom as an independent entity, overlooking the dependency among atoms within the substructures. This paper introduces a novel approach that enhances molecular representation learning by incorporating substructural information in the diffusion model framework. We propose a novel diffusion model termed SubgDiff for involving the molecular subgraph information in diffusion. Specifically, SubgDiff adopts three vital techniques: i) subgraph prediction, ii) expectation state, and iii) $k$-step same subgraph diffusion, to enhance the perception of molecular substructure in the denoising network. Experiments on extensive downstream tasks, especially the molecular force predictions, demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.

TEG-DB: A Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark of Textual-Edge Graphs
Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) augment graph structures with natural language descriptions, facilitating detailed depictions of data and their interconnections across various real-world settings. However, existing TAG datasets predominantly feature textual information only at the nodes, with edges typically represented by mere binary or categorical attributes. This lack of rich textual edge annotations significantly limits the exploration of contextual relationships between entities, hindering deeper insights into graph-structured data. To address this gap, we introduce Textual-Edge Graphs Datasets and Benchmark (TEG-DB), a comprehensive and diverse collection of benchmark textual-edge datasets featuring rich textual descriptions on nodes and edges. The TEG-DB datasets are large-scale and encompass a wide range of domains, from citation networks to social networks. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments on TEG-DB to assess the extent to which current techniques, including pre-trained language models, graph neural networks, and their combinations, can utilize textual node and edge information. Our goal is to elicit advancements in   textual-edge graph research, specifically in developing methodologies that exploit rich textual node and edge descriptions to enhance graph analysis and provide deeper insights into complex real-world networks. The entire TEG-DB project is publicly accessible as an open-source repository on Github, accessible at https://github.com/Zhuofeng-Li/TEG-Benchmark.

Text-space Graph Foundation Models: Comprehensive Benchmarks and New Insights ðŸŒŸ
Given the ubiquity of graph data and its applications in diverse domains, building a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that can work well across different graphs and tasks with a unified backbone has recently garnered significant interests. A major obstacle to achieving this goal stems from the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit diverse node features. Inspired by multi-modal models that align different modalities with natural language, the text has recently been adopted to provide a unified feature space for diverse graphs. Despite the great potential of these text-space GFMs, current research in this field is hampered by two problems. First, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark with unified problem settings hinders a clear understanding of the comparative effectiveness and practical value of different text-space GFMs. Second, there is a lack of sufficient datasets to thoroughly explore the methods' full potential and verify their effectiveness across diverse settings. To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark providing novel text-space datasets and comprehensive evaluation under unified problem settings. Empirical results provide new insights and inspire future research directions. Our code and data are publicly available from https://github.com/CurryTang/TSGFM.

TFGDA: Exploring Topology and Feature Alignment in Semi-supervised Graph Domain Adaptation through Robust Clustering
Semi-supervised graph domain adaptation, as a branch of graph transfer learning, aims to annotate unlabeled target graph nodes by utilizing transferable knowledge learned from a label-scarce source graph. However, most existing studies primarily concentrate on aligning feature distributions directly to extract domain-invariant features, while ignoring the utilization of the intrinsic structure information in graphs. Inspired by the significance of data structure information in enhancing models' generalization performance, this paper aims to investigate how to leverage the structure information to assist graph transfer learning. To this end, we propose an innovative framework called TFGDA. Specially, TFGDA employs a structure alignment strategy named STSA to encode graphs' topological structure information into the latent space, greatly facilitating the learning of transferable features. To achieve a stable alignment of feature distributions, we also introduce a SDA strategy to mitigate domain discrepancy on the sphere. Moreover, to address the overfitting issue caused by label scarcity, a simple but effective RNC strategy is devised to guide the discriminative clustering of unlabeled nodes. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of TFGDA over SOTA methods.

TFG: Unified Training-Free Guidance for Diffusion Models
Given an unconditional diffusion model and a predictor for a target property of interest (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. Existing methods, though effective in various individual applications, often lack theoretical grounding and rigorous testing on extensive benchmarks. As a result, they could even fail on simple tasks, and applying them to a new problem becomes unavoidably difficult. This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework that encompasses existing methods as special cases, unifying the study of training-free guidance into the analysis of an algorithm-agnostic design space. Via theoretical and empirical investigation, we propose an efficient and effective hyper-parameter searching strategy that can be readily applied to any downstream task. We systematically benchmark training-free guidance across 6 diffusion models on 14 tasks with 38 targets, and achieve a 7.4% performance improvement on average. We believe our framework and benchmark offer a solid foundation for future research in this area.

The Best of Both Worlds: On the Dilemma of Out-of-distribution Detection
Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for model trustworthiness which aims to sensitively identity semantic OOD samples and robustly generalize for covariate-shifted OOD samples. However, we discover that the superior OOD detection performance of state-of-the-art methods is achieved by secretly sacrificing the OOD generalization ability. The classification accuracy frequently collapses catastrophically when even slight noise is encountered. Such a phenomenon violates the motivation of trustworthiness and significantly limits the model's deployment in the real world. What is the hidden reason behind such a limitation? In this work, we theoretically demystify the "\textit{sensitive-robust}" dilemma that lies in previous OOD detection methods. Consequently, a theory-inspired algorithm is induced to overcome such a dilemma. By decoupling the uncertainty learning objective from a Bayesian perspective, the conflict between OOD detection and OOD generalization is naturally harmonized and a dual-optimized performance could be expected. Empirical studies show that our method achieves superior performance on commonly used benchmarks. To our best knowledge, this work is the first principled OOD detection method that achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without sacrificing OOD generalization ability. Our code is available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DUL_NIPS-631B}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DUL}.

The GAN is dead; long live the GAN! A Modern GAN Baseline ðŸŒŸ
There is a widely-spread claim that GANs are difficult to train, and GAN architectures in the literature are littered with empirical tricks. We provide evidence against this claim and build a modern GAN baseline in a more principled manner. First, we derive a well-behaved regularized relativistic GAN loss that addresses issues of mode dropping and non-convergence that were previously tackled via a bag of ad-hoc tricks. We analyze our loss mathematically and prove that it admits local convergence guarantees, unlike most existing relativistic losses. Second, our new loss allows us to discard all ad-hoc tricks and replace outdated backbones used in common GANs with modern architectures. Using StyleGAN2 as an example, we present a roadmap of simplification and modernization that results in a new minimalist baseline---R3GAN. Despite being simple, our approach surpasses StyleGAN2 on FFHQ, ImageNet, CIFAR, and Stacked MNIST datasets, and compares favorably against state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models.

The Group Robustness is in the Details: Revisiting Finetuning under Spurious Correlations ðŸŒŸ
Modern machine learning models are prone to over-reliance on spurious correlations, which can often lead to poor performance on minority groups. In this paper, we identify surprising and nuanced behavior of finetuned models on worst-group accuracy via comprehensive experiments on four well-established benchmarks across vision and language tasks. We first show that the commonly used approach of class-balanced mini-batch finetuning can induce a decrease in worst-group accuracy (WGA) with training epochs, leading to performance no better than without class-balancing. While in some scenarios, removing data to create a class-balanced subset is more effective, we show this depends on group structure and propose a mixture method which can outperform both techniques. Next, we show that scaling pretrained models is generally beneficial for worst-group accuracy, but only in conjuction with appropriate class-balancing. Finally, we identify spectral imbalance in finetuning features as a potential source of group disparities --- minority group covariances incur a larger spectral norm than majority groups once conditioned on the classes. Our results show more nuanced interactions of modern finetuned models with group robustness than was previously known.

The Impact of Initialization on the Finetuning Dynamics in LoRA
In this paper, we study the role of initialization in Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as originally introduced in Hu et al. (2021). Essentially, to start from the pretrained model, one can either initialize $B$ to zero and $A$ to random, or vice-versa. In both cases, the product $BA$ is equal to zero at initialization, which makes finetuning starts from the pretrained model. These two initialization schemes are seemingly similar. They should in-principle yield the same performance and share the same optimal learning rate. We demonstrate that this is a *wrong intuition* and that the first scheme (of initializing $B$ to zero and $A$ to random) on average in our experiments yields better performance compared to the other scheme. Our theoretical analysis shows that the reason behind this might be that the first initialization allows the use of larger learning rates (without causing output instability) compared to the second initialization, resulting in more efficient learning of the first scheme. We validate our results with extensive experiments.

The Intelligible and Effective Graph Neural Additive Network
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for learning over graph-structured data.  However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial.In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design.  Our model,  Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models,  and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, allowing both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe the exact way the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.

The Mamba in the Llama: Distilling and Accelerating Hybrid Models
Recent research suggests that state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba can be competitive with Transformer models for language modeling with advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus and expertise on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models into SSMs for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into SSMs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of state-space models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can distill a large Transformer into a hybrid SSM and decode it efficiently.

Theoretical and Empirical Insights into the Origins of Degree Bias in Graph Neural Networks ðŸŒŸ
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often perform better for high-degree nodes than low-degree nodes on node classification tasks. This degree bias can reinforce social marginalization by, e.g., privileging celebrities and other high-degree actors in social networks during social and content recommendation. While researchers have proposed numerous hypotheses for why GNN degree bias occurs, we find via a survey of 38 degree bias papers that these hypotheses are often not rigorously validated, and can even be contradictory. Thus, we provide an analysis of the origins of degree bias in message-passing GNNs with different graph filters. We prove that high-degree test nodes tend to have a lower probability of misclassification regardless of how GNNs are trained. Moreover, we show that degree bias arises from a variety of factors that are associated with a node's degree (e.g., homophily of neighbors, diversity of neighbors). Furthermore, we show that during training, some GNNs may adjust their loss on low-degree nodes more slowly than on high-degree nodes; however, with sufficiently many epochs of training, message-passing GNNs can achieve their maximum possible training accuracy, which is not significantly limited by their expressive power. Throughout our analysis, we connect our findings to previously-proposed hypotheses for the origins of degree bias, supporting and unifying some while drawing doubt to others. We validate our theoretical findings on 8 common real-world networks, and based on our theoretical and empirical insights, describe a roadmap to alleviate degree bias.

Theoretical Foundations of Deep Selective State-Space Models
Structured state-space models (SSMs) are gaining popularity as effective foundational architectures for sequential data, demonstrating outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains alongside desirable scalability properties. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for a selectivity mechanism leveraging multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. Mamba, GLA, Hawk/Griffin, HGRN2), then the resulting architecture can surpass attention-powered foundation models trained on text in both accuracy and efficiency, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to the selectivity mechanism, often linked to in-context learning, using tools from Rough Path Theory. We provide a framework for the theoretical analysis of generalized selective SSMs, fully characterizing their expressive power and identifying the gating mechanism as the crucial architectural choice. Our analysis provides a closed-form description of the expressive powers of modern SSMs, such as Mamba, quantifying theoretically the drastic improvement in performance from the previous generation of models, such as S4. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models, but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants. In particular, it suggests cross-channel interactions could play a vital role in future improvements.

Theoretical guarantees in KL for Diffusion Flow Matching
Flow Matching (FM) (also referred to as stochastic interpolants or rectified flows)  stands out as a class of generative models that aims to bridge in finite time the target distribution $\nu^\star$ with an auxiliary distribution $\mu$ leveraging a fixed coupling $\pi$ and a bridge which can either be deterministic or stochastic. These two ingredients define a path measure which can then be approximated by learning the drift of its Markovian projection. The main contribution of this paper is to provide relatively mild assumption on $\nu^\star$, $\mu$ and $\pi$ to obtain non-asymptotics guarantees for Diffusion Flow Matching (DFM) models using as bridge the conditional distribution associated with the Brownian motion. More precisely, it establishes bounds on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the target distribution and the one generated by such DFM models under moment conditions on the score of $\nu^\star$, $\mu$ and $\pi$, and a standard $\mathrm{L}^2$-drift-approximation error assumption.

To Learn or Not to Learn, That is the Question ðŸŒŸ
Perceptual learning refers to the practices through which participants learn to improve their performance in perceiving sensory stimuli. Two seemingly conflicting phenomena of specificity and transfer have been widely observed in perceptual learning. Here, we propose a dual-learning model to reconcile these two phenomena. The model consists of two learning processes. One is task-based learning, which is fast and enables the brain to adapt to a task rapidly by using existing feature representations. The other is feature-based learning, which is slow and enables the brain to improve feature representations to match the statistical change of the environment. Associated with different training paradigms, the interactions between these two learning processes induce the rich phenomena of perceptual learning. Specifically, in the training paradigm where the same stimulus condition is presented excessively, feature-based learning is triggered, which incurs specificity, while in the paradigm where the stimulus condition varies during the training, task-based learning dominates to induce the transfer effect. As the number of training sessions under the same stimulus condition increases, a transition from transfer to specificity occurs. We demonstrate that the dual-learning model can account for both the specificity and transfer phenomena observed in classical psychophysical experiments. We hope that this study gives us insight into understanding how the brain balances the accomplishment of a new task and the consumption of learning effort.

Towards Dynamic Message Passing on Graphs ðŸŒŸ
Message passing plays a vital role in graph neural networks (GNNs) for effective feature learning. However, the over-reliance on input topology diminishes the efficacy of message passing and restricts the ability of GNNs. Despite efforts made to mitigate the reliance, existing study encounters message-passing bottlenecks or high computational expense problems, which invokes the demands for flexible message passing with low complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic message-passing mechanism for GNNs. It projects graph nodes and learnable pseudo nodes into a common space with measurable spatial relations between them. With nodes moving in the space, their evolving relations facilitate flexible pathway construction for a dynamic message-passing process. Associating pseudo nodes to input graphs with their measured relations, graph nodes can communicate with each other intermediately through pseudo nodes under linear complexity.We further develop a GNN model named $\mathtt{N^2}$ based on our dynamic message-passing mechanism. $\mathtt{N^2}$ employs a single recurrent layer to recursively generate the displacements of nodes and construct optimal dynamic pathways. Evaluation on eighteen benchmarks demonstrates the superior performance of $\mathtt{N^2}$ over popular GNNs. $\mathtt{N^2}$ successfully scales to large-scale benchmarks and requires significantly fewer parameters for graph classification with the shared recurrent layer.

Towards More Efficient Property Inference Attacks on Graph Neural Networks
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable attention due to their diverse applications. However, the scarcity and quality limitations of graph data present challenges to their training process in practical settings. To facilitate the development of effective GNNs, companies and researchers often seek external collaboration. Yet, directly sharing data raises privacy concerns, motivating data owners to train GNNs on their private graphs and share the trained models instead. Unfortunately, these released models may still inadvertently disclose sensitive properties of their training graphs (e.g., average default rate in a transaction network), leading to severe consequences for data owners. Hence, it is vital for them to evaluate the risk of sensitive information leakage from shared models by devising graph property inference attacks. Existing approaches typically train numerous shadow models for developing such attack, which is computationally intensive and impractical. To address this issue, we propose an efficient graph property inference attack by leveraging model approximation techniques. Our method requires training only a minimal set of models on graphs, by introducing model approximation to generate a sufficient number of approximated models for attacks.  Furthermore, to select approximated models with minimal approximation errors, we theoretically analyze the error bounds for each approximation. Meanwhile, we propose a diversity-enhancing mechanism based on edit distance to ensure diversity among approximated models. Extensive experiments across six real-world scenarios demonstrate our method's substantial improvement over baselines, with average increases of 2.7\% in attack accuracy and 5.6\% in ROC-AUC, while being 6.5Ã— faster compared to the best baseline. Our code is available at: \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/efficient_gpia-8F47}.

Towards Principled Graph Transformers ðŸŒŸ
The expressive power of graph learning architectures based on the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman ($k$-WL) hierarchy is well understood. However, such architectures often fail to deliver solid predictive performance on real-world tasks, limiting their practical impact. In contrast, global attention-based models such as graph transformers demonstrate strong performance in practice, but comparing their expressive power with the $k$-WL hierarchy remains challenging, particularly since these architectures rely on positional or structural encodings for their expressivity and predictive performance. To address this, we show that the recently proposed Edge Transformer, a global attention model operating on node pairs instead of nodes, has 3-WL expressive power when provided with the right tokenization. Empirically, we demonstrate that the Edge Transformer surpasses other theoretically aligned architectures regarding predictive performance while not relying on positional or structural encodings.

Towards Reliable Model Selection for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation: An Empirical Study and A Certified Baseline
Selecting appropriate hyperparameters is crucial for unlocking the full potential of advanced unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods in unlabeled target domains. Although this challenge remains under-explored, it has recently garnered increasing attention with the proposals of various model selection methods. Reliable model selection should maintain performance across diverse UDA methods and scenarios, especially avoiding highly risky worst-case selectionsâ€”selecting the model or hyperparameter with the worst performance in the pool.Are existing model selection methods reliable and versatile enough for different UDA tasks? In this paper, we provide a comprehensive empirical study involving 8 existing model selection approaches to answer this question. Our evaluation spans 12 UDA methods across 5 diverse UDA benchmarks and 5 popular UDA scenarios.Surprisingly, we find that none of these approaches can effectively avoid the worst-case selection. In contrast, a simple but overlooked ensemble-based selection approach, which we call EnsV, is both theoretically and empirically certified to avoid the worst-case selection, ensuring high reliability. Additionally, EnsV is versatile for various practical but challenging UDA scenarios, including validation of open-partial-set UDA and source-free UDA.Finally, we call for more attention to the reliability of model selection in UDA: avoiding the worst-case is as significant as achieving peak selection performance and should not be overlooked when developing new model selection methods. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Transfer Learning for Diffusion Models
Diffusion models, a specific type of generative model, have achieved unprecedented performance in recent years and consistently produce high-quality synthetic samples. A critical prerequisite for their notable success lies in the presence of a substantial number of training samples, which can be impractical in real-world applications due to high collection costs or associated risks. Consequently, various finetuning and regularization approaches have been proposed to transfer knowledge from existing pre-trained models to specific target domains with limited data. This paper introduces the Transfer Guided Diffusion Process (TGDP), a novel approach distinct from conventional finetuning and regularization methods. We prove that the optimal diffusion model for the target domain integrates pre-trained diffusion models on the source domain with additional guidance from a domain classifier. We further extend TGDP to a conditional version for modeling the joint distribution of data and its corresponding labels, together with two additional regularization terms to enhance the model performance. We validate the effectiveness of TGDP on Gaussian mixture simulations and on real electrocardiogram (ECG) datasets.

Transfer Learning for Latent Variable Network Models
We study transfer learning for estimation in latent variable network models. In our setting, the conditional edge probability matrices given the latent variables are represented by $P$ for the source and $Q$ for the target. We wish to estimate $Q$ given two kinds of data: (1) edge data from a subgraph induced by an $o(1)$ fraction of the nodes of $Q$, and (2) edge data from all of $P$. If the source $P$ has no relation to the target $Q$, the estimation error must be $\Omega(1)$. However, we show that if the latent variables are shared, then vanishing error is possible. We give an efficient algorithm that utilizes the ordering of a suitably defined graph distance. Our algorithm achieves $o(1)$ error and does not assume a parametric form on the source or target networks. Next, for the specific case of Stochastic Block Models we prove a minimax lower bound and show that a simple algorithm achieves this rate. Finally, we empirically demonstrate our algorithm's use on real-world and simulated graph transfer problems.

U-DiTs: Downsample Tokens in U-Shaped Diffusion Transformers
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) introduce the transformer architecture to diffusion tasks for latent-space image generation. With an isotropic architecture that chains a series of transformer blocks, DiTs demonstrate competitive performance and good scalability; but meanwhile, the abandonment of U-Net by DiTs and their following improvements is worth rethinking. To this end, we conduct a simple toy experiment by comparing a U-Net architectured DiT with an isotropic one. It turns out that the U-Net architecture only gain a slight advantage amid the U-Net inductive bias, indicating potential redundancies within the U-Net-style DiT. Inspired by the discovery that U-Net backbone features are low-frequency-dominated, we perform token downsampling on the query-key-value tuple for self-attention and bring further improvements despite a considerable amount of reduction in computation. Based on self-attention with downsampled tokens, we propose a series of U-shaped DiTs (U-DiTs) in the paper and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the extraordinary performance of U-DiT models. The proposed U-DiT could outperform DiT-XL with only 1/6 of its computation cost.

UDPM: Upsampling Diffusion Probabilistic Models
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) have recently gained significant attention. DDPMs compose a Markovian process that begins in the data domain and gradually adds noise until reaching pure white noise. DDPMs generate high-quality samples from complex data distributions by defining an inverse process and training a deep neural network to learn this mapping. However, these models are inefficient because they require many diffusion steps to produce aesthetically pleasing samples. Additionally, unlike generative adversarial networks (GANs), the latent space of diffusion models is less interpretable. In this work, we propose to generalize the denoising diffusion process into an Upsampling Diffusion Probabilistic Model (UDPM). In the forward process, we reduce the latent variable dimension through downsampling, followed by the traditional noise perturbation. As a result, the reverse process gradually denoises and upsamples the latent variable to produce a sample from the data distribution. We formalize the Markovian diffusion processes of UDPM and demonstrate its generation capabilities on the popular FFHQ, AFHQv2, and CIFAR10 datasets. UDPM generates images with as few as three network evaluations, whose overall computational cost is less than a single DDPM or EDM step, while achieving an FID score of 6.86. This surpasses current state-of-the-art efficient diffusion models that use a single denoising step for sampling. Additionally, UDPM offers an interpretable and interpolable latent space, which gives it an advantage over traditional DDPMs.

UGC: Universal Graph Coarsening ðŸŒŸ
In the era of big data, graphs have emerged as a natural representation of intricate relationships. However, graph sizes often become unwieldy, leading to storage, computation, and analysis challenges. A crucial demand arises for methods that can effectively downsize large graphs while retaining vital insights. Graph coarsening seeks to simplify large graphs while maintaining essential features. Most published methods are suitable for homophilic datasets, limiting their universal use. We propose **U**niversal **G**raph **C**oarsening (UGC), a framework equally suitable for homophilic and heterophilic datasets. UGC integrates node attributes and adjacency information, leveraging the dataset's heterophily factor. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UGC preserves spectral similarity while coarsening. In comparison to existing methods, UGC is 4$\times$ to 15$\times$ faster, has lower eigen-error, and yields superior performance on downstream processing tasks even at 70% coarsening ratios.

Uncovering the Redundancy in Graph Self-supervised Learning Models ðŸŒŸ
Graph self-supervised learning, as a powerful pre-training paradigm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) without labels, has received considerable attention. We have witnessed the success of graph self-supervised learning on pre-training the parameters of GNNs, leading many not to doubt that whether the learned GNNs parameters are all useful. In this paper, by presenting the experimental evidence and analysis, we surprisingly discover that the graph self-supervised learning models are highly redundant at both of neuron and layer levels, e.g., even randomly removing 51.6\% of parameters, the performance of graph self-supervised learning models still retains at least 96.2\%. This discovery implies that the parameters of graph self-supervised models can be largely reduced, making simultaneously fine-tuning both graph self-supervised learning models and prediction layers more feasible. Therefore, we further design a novel graph pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm called SLImming DE-correlation Fine-tuning (SLIDE). The effectiveness of SLIDE is verified through extensive experiments on various benchmarks, and the performance can be even improved with fewer parameters of models in most cases. For example, in comparison with full fine-tuning GraphMAE on Amazon-Computers dataset, even randomly reducing 40\% of parameters, we can still achieve the improvement of 0.24\% and 0.27\% for Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 scores respectively.

Understanding Representation of Deep Equilibrium Models from Neural Collapse Perspective
Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ), which serves as a typical implicit neural network, emphasizes their memory efficiency and competitive performance compared to explicit neural networks. However, there has been relatively limited theoretical analysis on the representation of DEQ. In this paper, we utilize the Neural Collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) as a tool to systematically analyze the representation of DEQ under both balanced and imbalanced conditions. $\mathcal{NC}$ is an interesting phenomenon in the neural network training process that characterizes the geometry of class features and classifier weights. While extensively studied in traditional explicit neural networks, the $\mathcal{NC}$ phenomenon has not received substantial attention in the context of implicit neural networks. We theoretically show that $\mathcal{NC}$ exists in DEQ under balanced conditions. Moreover, in imbalanced settings, despite the presence of minority collapse, DEQ demonstrated advantages over explicit neural networks. These advantages include the convergence of extracted features to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame and self-duality properties under mild conditions, highlighting DEQ's superiority in handling imbalanced datasets. Finally, we validate our theoretical analyses through experiments in both balanced and imbalanced scenarios.

Understanding the Expressive Power and Mechanisms of Transformer for Sequence Modeling
We conduct a systematic study of the approximation properties of Transformer for sequence modeling with long, sparse and complicated memory. We investigate the mechanisms through which different components of Transformer, such as the dot-product self-attention, positional encoding and feed-forward layer, affect its expressive power, and we study their combined effects through establishing explicit approximation rates.Our study reveals the roles of critical parameters in the Transformer, such as the number of layers and the number of attention heads.These theoretical insights are validated experimentally and offer natural suggestions for alternative architectures.

Understanding the expressivity and trainability of Fourier Neural Operator
In this paper, we explores the expressivity and trainability of the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). We establish a mean-field theory for the FNO, analyzing the behavior of the random FNO from an \emph{edge of chaos} perspective. Our investigation into the expressivity of a random FNO involves examining the ordered-chaos phase transition of the network based on the weight distribution. This phase transition demonstrates characteristics unique to the FNO, induced by mode truncation, while also showcasing similarities to those of densely connected networks. Furthermore, we identify a connection between expressivity and trainability: the ordered and chaotic phases correspond to regions of vanishing and exploding gradients, respectively. This finding provides a practical prerequisite for the stable training of the FNO. Our experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings.

Understanding the Gains from Repeated Self-Distillation
Self-Distillation is a special type of knowledge distillation where the student model has the same architecture as the teacher model. Despite using the same architecture and the same training data, self-distillation has been empirically observed to improve performance, especially when applied repeatedly. For such a process, there is a fundamental question of interest: How much gain is possible by applying multiple steps of self-distillation? To investigate this relative gain, we propose using the simple but canonical task of linear regression. Our analysis shows that the excess risk achieved by multi-step self-distillation can significantly improve upon a single step of self-distillation, reducing the excess risk by a factor of $d$, where $d$ is the input dimension. Empirical results on regression tasks from the UCI repository show a reduction in the learnt model's risk (MSE) by up to $47$%.

Understanding the Role of Equivariance in Self-supervised Learning
Contrastive learning has been a leading paradigm for self-supervised learning, but it is widely observed that it comes at the price of sacrificing useful features (e.g., colors) by being invariant to data augmentations. Given this limitation, there has been a surge of interest in equivariant self-supervised learning (E-SSL) that learns features to be augmentation-aware. However, even for the simplest rotation prediction method, there is a lack of rigorous understanding of why, when, and how E-SSL learns useful features for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we establish an information-theoretic perspective to understand the generalization ability of E-SSL. In particular, we identify a critical explaining-away effect in E-SSL that creates a synergy between the equivariant and classification tasks. This synergy effect encourages models to extract class-relevant features to improve its equivariant prediction, which, in turn, benefits downstream tasks requiring semantic features. Based on this perspective, we theoretically analyze the influence of data transformations and reveal several principles for practical designs of E-SSL. Our theory not only aligns well with existing E-SSL methods but also sheds light on new directions by exploring the benefits of model equivariance. We believe that a theoretically grounded understanding on the role of equivariance would inspire more principled and advanced designs in this field.

Understanding Transformer Reasoning Capabilities via Graph Algorithms ðŸŒŸ
Which transformer scaling regimes are able to perfectly solve different classes of algorithmic problems?   While tremendous empirical advances have been attained by transformer-based neural networks, a theoretical understanding of their algorithmic reasoning capabilities in realistic parameter regimes is lacking.  We investigate this question in terms of the networkâ€™s depth, width, and number of extra tokens for algorithm execution.  Our novel representational hierarchy separates 9 algorithmic reasoning problems into classes solvable by transformers in different realistic parameter scaling regimes.  We prove that logarithmic depth is necessary and sufficient for tasks like graph connectivity, while single-layer transformers with small embedding dimensions can solve contextual retrieval tasks. We also support our theoretical analysis with ample empirical evidence using the GraphQA benchmark.  These results show that transformers excel at many graph reasoning tasks, even outperforming specialized graph neural networks.

Understanding Transformers via N-Gram Statistics
Transformer based large-language models display extreme proficiency with language yet a precise understanding of how they work remains elusive. One way of demystifying transformer predictions would be to describe how they depend on their context in terms of simple template functions. This paper takes a first step in this direction by considering families of functions (i.e. rules) formed out of simple N-gram based statistics of the training data. By studying how well these rulesets approximate transformer predictions, we obtain a variety of novel discoveries: a simple method to detect overfitting during training without using a holdout set, a quantative measure of how transformers progress from learning simple to more complex statistical rules over the course of training, a model-variance criterion governing when transformer predictions tend to be described by N-gram rules, and insights into how well transformers can be approximated by N-gram rulesets in the limit where these rulesets become increasingly complex.

Unified Covariate Adjustment for Causal Inference
Causal effect identification and estimation are two crucial tasks in causal inference. Although causal effect identification has been theoretically resolved, many existing estimators only address a subset of scenarios, known as the sequential back-door adjustment (SBD) (Pearl and Robins, 1995) or g-formula (Robins, 1986). Recent efforts for developing general-purpose estimators with broader coverage, incorporating the front-door adjustment (FD) (Pearl, 2000) and more, lack scalability due to the high computational cost of summing over high-dimensional variables. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that achieves broad coverage of causal estimands beyond the SBD, incorporating various sum-product functionals like the FD, while maintaining scalability -- estimated in polynomial time relative to the number of variables and samples. Specifically, we present the class of UCA for which a scalable and doubly robust estimator is developed. In particular, we illustrate the expressiveness of UCA for a wide spectrum of causal estimands (e.g., SBD, FD, and more) in causal inference. We then develop an estimator that exhibits computational efficiency and doubly robustness. The scalability and robustness of the proposed framework are verified through simulations.

Unifying Generation and Prediction on Graphs with Latent Graph Diffusion ðŸŒŸ
In this paper, we propose the first framework that enables solving graph learning tasks of all levels (node, edge and graph) and all types (generation, regression and classification) with one model. We first formulate prediction tasks including regression and classification as (conditional) generation, which is a generic formulation that enables diffusion models to perform deterministic tasks with provable guarantees. We then propose Latent Graph Diffusion (LGD), a generative model that can generate node, edge, and graph-level features of all categories simultaneously. We achieve this goal by embedding the graph structures and features into a latent space leveraging a powerful encoder which can also be decoded, then training a diffusion model in the latent space. LGD is also capable of conditional generation through a specifically designed cross-attention mechanism. Leveraging LGD and the unified ``all tasks as generation'' formulation, our framework is capable of solving tasks of all levels and all types. We verify the effectiveness of our framework with extensive experiments, where our models achieve state-of-the-art or highly competitive results across a wide range of generation and regression tasks.

Unifying Homophily and Heterophily for Spectral Graph Neural Networks via Triple Filter Ensembles ðŸŒŸ
Polynomial-based learnable spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) utilize polynomial to approximate graph convolutions and have achieved impressive performance on graphs. Nevertheless, there are three progressive problems to be solved. Some models use polynomials with better approximation for approximating filters, yet perform worse on real-world graphs. Carefully crafted graph learning methods, sophisticated polynomial approximations, and refined coefficient constraints leaded to overfitting, which diminishes the generalization of the models. How to design a model that retains the ability of polynomial-based spectral GNNs to approximate filters while it possesses higher generalization and performance? In this paper, we propose a spectral GNN with triple filter ensemble (TFE-GNN), which extracts homophily and heterophily from graphs with different levels of homophily adaptively while utilizing the initial features. Specifically, the first and second ensembles are combinations of a set of base low-pass and high-pass filters, respectively, after which the third ensemble combines them with two learnable coefficients and yield a graph convolution (TFE-Conv). Theoretical analysis shows that the approximation ability of TFE-GNN is consistent with that of ChebNet under certain conditions, namely it can learn arbitrary filters. TFE-GNN can be viewed as a reasonable combination of two unfolded and integrated excellent spectral GNNs, which motivates it to perform well. Experiments show that TFE-GNN achieves high generalization and new state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets.

Unveiling the Hidden Structure of Self-Attention via Kernel Principal Component Analysis
The remarkable success of transformers in sequence modeling tasks, spanning various applications in natural language processing and computer vision, is attributed to the critical role of self-attention. Similar to the development of most deep learning models, the construction of these attention mechanisms relies on heuristics and experience. In our work, we derive self-attention from kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) and show that self-attention projects its query vectors onto the principal component axes of its key matrix in a feature space. We then formulate the exact formula for the value matrix in self-attention, theoretically and empirically demonstrating that this value matrix captures the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix of the key vectors in self-attention. Leveraging our kernel PCA framework, we propose Attention with Robust Principal Components (RPC-Attention), a novel class of robust attention that is resilient to data contamination. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of RPC-Attention over softmax attention on the ImageNet-1K object classification, WikiText-103 language modeling, and ADE20K image segmentation task.

User-item fairness tradeoffs in recommendations
In the basic recommendation paradigm, the most relevant item is recommended to each user. This may result in some items receiving lower exposure than they "should"; to counter this, several algorithmic approaches have been developed to ensure item fairness. These approaches necessarily degrade recommendations for some users to improve outcomes for items, leading to user fairness concerns. In turn, a recent line of work has focused on developing algorithms for multi-sided fairness, to jointly optimize user fairness, item fairness, and overall recommendation quality. This induces the question: what is the tradeoff between these objectives, and what are the characteristics of (multi-objective) optimal solutions? Theoretically, we develop a model of recommendations with user, item, and overall utility objectives and characterize the solutions of fairness-constrained optimization. We identify two phenomena: (a) when user preferences are diverse, there is "free" item and user fairness; and (b) users whose preferences are misestimated can be especially disadvantaged by item fairness constraints. Empirically, we build a recommendation system for preprints on arXiv and implement our framework, measuring the phenomena in practice and showing how these phenomena inform the design of markets with recommendation systems-intermediated matching.

What can Foundation Modelsâ€™ Embeddings do?
Foundation models possess strong capabilities in reasoning and memorizing across modalities. To further unleash the power of foundation models, we present FIND, a generalized interface for aligning foundation models' embeddings with unified image and dataset-level understanding spanning modality and granularity. As shown in Fig.1, a lightweight transformer interface without tuning any foundation model weights is enough for segmentation, grounding, and retrieval in an interleaved manner. The proposed interface has the following favorable attributes: (1) Generalizable. It applies to various tasks spanning retrieval, segmentation, etc., under the same architecture and weights.  (2) Interleavable. With the benefit of multi-task multi-modal training, the proposed interface creates an interleaved shared embedding space. (3) Extendable. The proposed interface is adaptive to new tasks, and new models. In light of the interleaved embedding space, we introduce FIND-Bench, which introduces new training and evaluation annotations to the COCO dataset for interleaved segmentation and retrieval. We are the first work aligning foundations models' embeddings for interleave understanding. Meanwhile, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on FIND-Bench and competitive performance on standard retrieval and segmentation settings.

What do Graph Neural Networks learn? Insights from Tropical Geometry ðŸŒŸ
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been analyzed from multiple perspectives, including the WL-hierarchy, which exposes limits on their expressivity to distinguish graphs. However, characterizing the class of functions that they learn has remained unresolved. We address this fundamental question for message passing GNNs under ReLU activations, i.e., the de-facto choice for most GNNs.We first show that such GNNs learn tropical rational signomial maps, establishing an equivalence with feedforward networks (FNNs).We then elucidate the role of the choice of aggregation and update functions, and derive the first general upper and lower bounds on the geometric complexity (i.e., the number of linear regions), establishing new results for popular architectures such as GraphSAGE and GIN. We also introduce and theoretically analyze several new architectures to illuminate the relative merits of the feedforward and the message passing layers, and the tradeoffs involving depth and number of trainable parameters.  Finally, we also characterize the decision boundary for node and graph classification tasks.

What Is Missing For Graph Homophily? Disentangling Graph Homophily For Graph Neural Networks ðŸŒŸ
Graph homophily refers to the phenomenon that connected nodes tend to share similar characteristics. Understanding this concept and its related metrics is crucial for designing effective Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The most widely used homophily metrics, such as edge or node homophily, quantify such "similarity" as label consistency across the graph topology. These metrics are believed to be able to reflect the performance of GNNs, especially on node-level tasks. However, many recent studies have empirically demonstrated that the performance of GNNs does not always align with homophily metrics, and how homophily influences GNNs still remains unclear and controversial. Then, a crucial question arises from such controversy: Should we completely discard the conventional definition of graph homophily? In this paper, our answer is NO. We find that the original homophily is still useful, but only provides a partial understanding of the GNNs performance. To give a comprehensive view, we disentangle graph homophily into $3$ different aspects: label, structural, and feature homophily, which corresponds to $3$ basic elements of graph data and our proposed feature homophily can disentangle the influence of node features from label and structural homophily. To investigate their synergy, we propose a Contextual Stochastic Block Model with $3$ types of Homophily (CSBM-3H), where the topology and feature generation are controlled by those $3$ types of homophily. Based on CSBM-3H, we propose a composite metric, named Tri-Hom, which combines all $3$ homophily aspects. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that GNNs performance is indeed strongly correlated with Tri-Hom. Tri-Hom provides a more comprehensive view of homophily and can explain the inconsistency between conventional homophily metrics and GNNs performance. In addition, our experimental results on $31$ real-world datasets also verify that Tri-Hom aligns with GNNs performance significantly better than other $17$ existing metrics that only focus on a single homophily aspect, which confirms the superiority of the disentangled homophily.

What Matters in Graph Class Incremental Learning? An Information Preservation Perspective
Graph class incremental learning (GCIL) requires the model to classify emerging nodes of new classes while remembering old classes. Existing methods are designed to preserve effective information of old models or graph data to alleviate forgetting, but there is no clear theoretical understanding of what matters in information preservation. In this paper, we consider that present practice suffers from high semantic and structural shifts assessed by two devised shift metrics. We provide insights into information preservation in GCIL and find that maintaining graph information can preserve information of old models in theory to calibrate node semantic and graph structure shifts. We correspond graph information into low-frequency local-global parts and high-frequency parts in spatial domain. Based on the analysis, we propose a universal framework, Graph Spatial Information Preservation (GSIP). Specifically, for low-frequency information preservation, the old node representations obtained by inputting replayed nodes into the old model are aligned with the outputs of the node and its neighbors in the new model, then old and new outputs are globally matched after pooling. For high-frequency information preservation, the new node representations are encouraged to imitate the near neighbor pair similarity of old node representations. GSIP achieves a 10% increase in terms of the forgetting metric compared to prior methods on large-scale datasets. Our framework can also seamlessly integrate existing replay designs.

Why the Metric Backbone Preserves Community Structure ðŸŒŸ
The metric backbone of a weighted graph is the union of all-pairs shortest paths. It is obtained by removing all edges $(u,v)$ that are not the shortest path between $u$ and $v$. In networks with well-separated communities, the metric backbone tends to preserve many inter-community edges, because these edges serve as bridges connecting two communities, but tends to delete many intra-community edges because the communities are dense. This suggests that the metric backbone would dilute or destroy the community structure of the network. However, this is not borne out by prior empirical work, which instead showed that the metric backbone of real networks preserves the community structure of the original network well. In this work, we analyze the metric backbone of a broad class of weighted random graphs with communities, and we formally prove the robustness of the community structure with respect to the deletion of all the edges that are not in the metric backbone. An empirical comparison of several graph sparsification techniques confirms our theoretical finding and shows that the metric backbone is an efficient sparsifier in the presence of communities.

You Don't Need Data-Augmentations in Self-Supervised Learning ðŸŒŸ
Self-Supervised learning (SSL) with Joint-Embedding Architectures (JEA) has led to outstanding performances. All instantiations of this paradigm were trained using strong and well-established hand-crafted data augmentations, leading to the general belief that they are required for the proper training and performance of such models. On the other hand, generative reconstruction-based models such as BEIT and MAE or Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures such as I-JEPA have shown strong performance without using data augmentations except masking. In this work, we challenge the importance of invariance and data-augmentation in JEAs at scale. By running a case-study on a recent SSL foundation model -- DINOv2 -- we show that strong image representations can be obtained with JEAs and only cropping without resizing provided the training data is large enough, reaching state-of-the-art results and using the least amount of augmentation in the literature. Through this study, we also discuss the impact of compute constraints on the outcomes of experimental deep learning research, showing that they can lead to very different conclusions.

You May Better Reconstruct Anomalous over Normal Graphs: Analysis and a Simple Method for Reconstruction-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection
Graph autoencoders (Graph-AEs) learn representations of given graphs by aiming to reconstruct them. A notable application of Graph-AEs is graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD), whose objective is to identify graphs with anomalous topological structures and/or node features compared to the majority of the graph population. Graph-AEs for GLAD regard a graph with a high reconstruction error (i.e. mean aggregation of errors from all node pairs and/or nodes) as anomalies. Namely, the methods rest on the assumption that they would better reconstruct graphs with similar characteristics to the majority. We, however, report non-trivial counter-examples, a phenomenon we call reconstruction flip, and highlight the limitations of the existing Graph-AE-based GLAD methods. Specifically, we empirically and theoretically investigate when this assumption holds and when it fails. Through our analyses, we further argue that while the reconstruction errors for a given graph are effective features for GLAD, leveraging the multifaceted summaries of the reconstruction errors, beyond just average, can further strengthen the features. Thus, we propose a novel and simple GLAD method, named MUSE. The key innovation of MUSE involves taking multifaceted summaries of reconstruction errors as graph features for GLAD. This surprisingly simple method obtains SOTA performance in GLAD, performing best overall among 14 methods across 10 datasets.

Your contrastive learning problem is secretly a distribution alignment problem ðŸŒŸ
Despite the success of contrastive learning (CL) in vision and language, its theoretical foundations and mechanisms for arranging representations remain poorly understood. In this work, we build connections between noise contrastive estimation losses widely used in CL and distribution alignment with entropic optimal transport (OT). This connection allows us to develop a family of different losses and multistep variants for existing CL methods. Intuitively, by using more information from the distribution of latents, our approach allows a more distribution-aware  manipulation of the relationships within augmented sample sets.  We provide theoretical insights and experimental evidence demonstrating the benefits of our approach for generalized contrastive alignment. Through this framework, it is possible to leverage tools in OT to build unbalanced losses to handle noisy views and customize the representation space by changing the constraints on alignment. By reframing contrastive learning as an alignment problem and leveraging existing optimization tools for OT, our work provides new insights and connections between different self-supervised learning models in addition to new tools that can be more easily adapted to incorporate domain knowledge into learning.

Your Diffusion Model is Secretly a Noise Classifier and Benefits from Contrastive Training ðŸŒŸ
Diffusion models learn to denoise data and the trained denoiser is then used to generate new samples from the data distribution. In this paper, we revisit the diffusion sampling process and identify a fundamental cause of sample quality degradation: the denoiser is poorly estimated in regions that are far Outside Of the training Distribution (OOD), and the sampling process inevitably evaluates in these OOD regions.This can become problematic for all sampling methods, especially when we move to parallel sampling which requires us to initialize and update the entire sample trajectory of dynamics in parallel, leading to many OOD evaluations. To address this problem, we introduce a new self-supervised training objective that differentiates the levels of noise added to a sample, leading to improved OOD denoising performance. The approach is based on our observation that diffusion models implicitly define a log-likelihood ratio that distinguishes distributions with different amounts of noise, and this expression depends on denoiser performance outside the standard training distribution.We show by diverse experiments that the proposed contrastive diffusion training is effective for both sequential and parallel settings, and it improves the performance and speed of parallel samplers significantly.
