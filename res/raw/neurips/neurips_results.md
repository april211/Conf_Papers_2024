$C^2M^3$: Cycle-Consistent Multi-Model Merging
In this paper, we present a novel data-free method for merging neural networks in weight space. Our method optimizes for the permutations of network neurons while ensuring global coherence across all layers, and it outperforms recent layer-local approaches in a set of challenging scenarios. We then generalize the formulation to the $N$-models scenario to enforce cycle consistency of the permutations with guarantees, allowing circular compositions of permutations to be computed without accumulating error along the path.     We qualitatively and quantitatively motivate the need for such a constraint, showing its benefits when merging homogeneous sets of models in scenarios spanning varying architectures and datasets. We finally show that, when coupled with activation renormalization, the approach yields the best results in the task.

$\epsilon$-Softmax: Approximating One-Hot Vectors for Mitigating Label Noise
Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise, particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric condition, namely **$\epsilon$-softmax**, which simply modifies the outputs of the softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error $\epsilon$. Essentially, ***$\epsilon$-softmax** not only acts as an alternative for the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the loss function.* We  prove theoretically that **$\epsilon$-softmax** can achieve noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss function. Recognizing that **$\epsilon$-softmax**-enhanced losses may slightly reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise.

$SE(3)$ Equivariant Ray Embeddings for Implicit Multi-View Depth Estimation
Incorporating inductive bias by embedding geometric entities (such as rays) as input has proven successful in multi-view learning. However, the methods adopting this technique typically lack equivariance, which is crucial for effective 3D learning. Equivariance serves as a valuable inductive prior, aiding in the generation of robust multi-view features for 3D scene understanding. In this paper, we explore the application of equivariant multi-view learning to depth estimation, not only recognizing its significance for computer vision and robotics but also addressing the limitations of previous research. Most prior studies have either overlooked equivariance in this setting or achieved only approximate equivariance through data augmentation, which often leads to inconsistencies across different reference frames. To address this issue, we propose to embed $SE(3)$ equivariance into the Perceiver IO architecture. We employ Spherical Harmonics for positional encoding to ensure 3D rotation equivariance, and develop a specialized equivariant encoder and decoder within the Perceiver IO architecture. To validate our model, we applied it to the task of stereo depth estimation, achieving state of the art results on real-world datasets without explicit geometric constraints or extensive data augmentation.

$\text{ID}^3$: Identity-Preserving-yet-Diversified Diffusion Models for Synthetic Face Recognition
Synthetic face recognition (SFR) aims to generate synthetic face datasets that mimic the distribution of real face data, which allows for training face recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner. Despite the remarkable potential of diffusion models in image generation, current diffusion-based SFR models struggle with generalization to real-world faces. To address this limitation, we outline three key objectives for SFR: (1) promoting diversity across identities (inter-class diversity), (2) ensuring diversity within each identity by injecting various facial attributes (intra-class diversity), and (3) maintaining identity consistency within each identity group (intra-class identity preservation). Inspired by these goals, we introduce a diffusion-fueled SFR model termed $\text{ID}^3$. $\text{ID}^3$ employs an ID-preserving loss to generate diverse yet identity-consistent facial appearances. Theoretically, we show that minimizing this loss is equivalent to maximizing the lower bound of an adjusted conditional log-likelihood over ID-preserving data. This equivalence motivates an ID-preserving sampling algorithm, which operates over an adjusted gradient vector field, enabling the generation of fake face recognition datasets that approximate the distribution of real-world faces. Extensive experiments across five challenging benchmarks validate the advantages of $\text{ID}^3$.

$\textit{Bifr\"ost}$: 3D-Aware Image Composing with Language Instructions
This paper introduces $\textit{Bifr\"ost}$, a novel 3D-aware framework that is built upon diffusion models to perform instruction-based image composition. Previous methods concentrate on image compositing at the 2D level, which fall short in handling complex spatial relationships ($\textit{e.g.}$, occlusion). $\textit{Bifr\"ost}$ addresses these issues by training MLLM as a 2.5D location predictor and integrating depth maps as an extra condition during the generation process to bridge the gap between 2D and 3D, which enhances spatial comprehension and supports sophisticated spatial interactions. Our method begins by fine-tuning MLLM with a custom counterfactual dataset to predict 2.5D object locations in complex backgrounds from language instructions. Then, the image-composing model is uniquely designed to process multiple types of input features, enabling it to perform high-fidelity image compositions that consider occlusion, depth blur, and image harmonization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that $\textit{Bifr\"ost}$ significantly outperforms existing methods, providing a robust solution for generating realistically composed images in scenarios demanding intricate spatial understanding. This work not only pushes the boundaries of generative image compositing but also reduces reliance on expensive annotated datasets by effectively utilizing existing resources in innovative ways.

$\texttt{dattri}$: A Library for Efficient Data Attribution
Data attribution methods aim to quantify the influence of individual training samples on the prediction of artificial intelligence (AI) models. As training data plays an increasingly crucial role in the modern development of large-scale AI models, data attribution has found broad applications in improving AI performance and safety. However, despite a surge of new data attribution methods being developed recently, there lacks a comprehensive library that facilitates the development, benchmarking, and deployment of different data attribution methods. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{dattri}$, an open-source data attribution library that addresses the above needs. Specifically, $\texttt{dattri}$ highlights three novel design features. Firstly, $\texttt{dattri}$ proposes a unified and easy-to-use API, allowing users to integrate different data attribution methods into their PyTorch-based machine learning pipeline with a few lines of code changed. Secondly, $\texttt{dattri}$ modularizes low-level utility functions that are commonly used in data attribution methods, such as Hessian-vector product, inverse-Hessian-vector product or random projection, making it easier for researchers to develop new data attribution methods. Thirdly, $\texttt{dattri}$ provides a comprehensive benchmark framework with pre-trained models and ground truth annotations for a variety of benchmark settings, including generative AI settings. We have implemented a variety of state-of-the-art efficient data attribution methods that can be applied to large-scale neural network models, and will continuously update the library in the future. Using the developed $\texttt{dattri}$ library, we are able to perform a comprehensive and fair benchmark analysis across a wide range of data attribution methods. The source code of $\texttt{dattri}$ is available at https://github.com/TRAIS-Lab/dattri.

$\texttt{dopanim}$: A Dataset of Doppelganger Animals with Noisy Annotations from Multiple Humans
Human annotators typically provide annotated data for training machine learning models, such as neural networks. Yet, human annotations are subject to noise, impairing generalization performances. Methodological research on approaches counteracting noisy annotations requires corresponding datasets for a meaningful empirical evaluation. Consequently, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, $\\texttt{dopanim}$, consisting of about $15{,}750$ animal images of $15$ classes with ground truth labels. For approximately $10{,}500$ of these images, $20$ humans provided over $52{,}000$ annotations with an accuracy of circa $67 \\, \\%$. Its key attributes include (1) the challenging task of classifying $\\texttt{dop}$pelganger $\\texttt{anim}$als, (2) human-estimated likelihoods as annotations, and (3) annotator metadata. We benchmark well-known multi-annotator learning approaches using seven variants of this dataset and outline further evaluation use cases such as learning beyond hard class labels and active learning. Our dataset and a comprehensive codebase are publicly available to emulate the data collection process and to reproduce all empirical results.

2DQuant: Low-bit Post-Training Quantization for Image Super-Resolution
Low-bit quantization has become widespread for compressing image super-resolution (SR) models for edge deployment, which allows advanced SR models to enjoy compact low-bit parameters and efficient integer/bitwise constructions for storage compression and inference acceleration, respectively. However, it is notorious that low-bit quantization degrades the accuracy of SR models compared to their full-precision (FP) counterparts. Despite several efforts to alleviate the degradation, the transformer-based SR model still suffers severe degradation due to its distinctive activation distribution. In this work, we present a dual-stage low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) method for image super-resolution, namely 2DQuant, which achieves efficient and accurate SR under low-bit quantization. The proposed method first investigates the weight and activation and finds that the distribution is characterized by coexisting symmetry and asymmetry, long tails. Specifically, we propose Distribution-Oriented Bound Initialization (DOBI), using different searching strategies to search a coarse bound for quantizers. To obtain refined quantizer parameters, we further propose Distillation Quantization Calibration (DQC), which employs a distillation approach to make the quantized model learn from its FP counterpart. Through extensive experiments on different bits and scaling factors, the performance of DOBI can reach the state-of-the-art (SOTA) while after stage two, our method surpasses existing PTQ in both metrics and visual effects. 2DQuant gains an increase in PSNR as high as 4.52dB on Set5 (x2) compared with SOTA when quantized to 2-bit and enjoys a 3.60x compression ratio and 5.08x speedup ratio. The code and models will be released.

3D Equivariant Pose Regression via Direct Wigner-D Harmonics Prediction
Determining the 3D orientations of an object in an image, known as single-image pose estimation, is a crucial task in 3D vision applications. Existing methods typically learn 3D rotations parametrized in the spatial domain using Euler angles, quaternions, and axis-angle representations. To effectively train 3D rotations, SO(3)-equivariant networks are used, allowing for the structured capture of pose patterns with data-efficient training. However, for efficient SO(3)-equivariant networks such as spherical CNNs, parametrization in the spatial domain becomes problematic because their convolutions operate in the frequency domain. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel approach that predicts Wigner-D coefficients directly in the frequency domain for 3D rotation regression. Our method employs SO(3)-equivariant networks alongside a spherical mapper to project 2D image features onto the sphere, ensuring consistent and reliable performance under arbitrary rotations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard pose estimation benchmarks, ModelNet10-SO(3) and PASCAL3D+, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency compared to existing 3D rotation estimation methods.

3DET-Mamba: Causal Sequence Modelling for End-to-End 3D Object Detection
Transformer-based architectures have been proven successful in detecting 3D objects from point clouds. However, the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism struggles to encode rich information as point cloud resolution increases. Recently, state space models (SSM) such as Mamba have gained great attention due to their linear complexity and long sequence modeling ability for language understanding. To exploit the potential of Mamba on 3D scene-level perception, for the first time, we propose 3DET-Mamba, which is a novel SSM-based model designed for indoor 3d object detection. Specifically, we divide the point cloud into different patches and use a lightweight yet effective Inner Mamba to capture local geometric information. To observe the scene from a global perspective, we introduce a novel Dual Mamba module that models the point cloud in terms of spatial distribution and continuity. Additionally, we design a Query-aware Mamba module that decodes context features into object sets under the guidance of ranked queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed 3DET-Mamba surpasses previous 3DETR on indoor 3D detection benchmarks such as ScanNet, improving AP25/AP50 from 65.0\%/47.0\% to 70.4\%/54.4\%, respectively.

3D Gaussian Splatting as Markov Chain Monte Carlo
While 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently become popular for neural rendering, current methods rely on carefully engineered cloning and splitting strategies for placing Gaussians, which does not always generalize and may lead to poor-quality renderings. For many real-world scenes this leads to their heavy dependence on good initializations. In this work, we rethink the set of 3D Gaussians as a random sample drawn from an underlying probability distribution describing the physical representation of the scene—in other words, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Under this view, we show that the 3D Gaussian updates can be converted as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) update by simply introducing noise. We then rewrite the densification and pruning strategies in 3D Gaussian Splatting as simply a deterministic state transition of MCMC samples, removing these heuristics from the framework. To do so, we revise the ‘cloning’ of Gaussians into a relocalization scheme that approximately preserves sample probability. To encourage efficient use of Gaussians, we introduce an L1-regularizer on the Gaussians. On various standard evaluation scenes, we show that our method provides improved rendering quality, easy control over the number of Gaussians, and robustness to initialization. The project website is available at https://3dgs-mcmc.github.io/.

3rd Workshop on New Frontiers in Adversarial Machine Learning (AdvML-Frontiers)
Adversarial machine learning (AdvML), a discipline that delves into the interaction of machine learning (ML) with ‘adversarial’ elements, has embarked on a new era propelled by the ever-expanding capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI). This momentum has been fueled by recent technological breakthroughs in large multimodal models (LMMs), particularly those designed for vision and language applications. The 3rd AdvML-Frontiers workshop at NeurIPS’24 continues the success of its predecessors, AdvML-Frontiers’22-23, by delving into the dynamic intersection of AdvML and LMMs. The rapid evolution of LMMs presents both new challenges and opportunities for AdvML, which can be distilled into two primary categories: AdvML for LMMs and LMMs for AdvML. This year, in addition to continuing to advance AdvML across the full theory-algorithm-application stack, the workshop is dedicated to addressing the intricate issues that emerge from these converging fields, with a focus on adversarial threats, cross-modal vulnerabilities, defensive strategies, multimodal human/AI feedback, and the overarching implications for security, privacy, and ethics. Join us at AdvML-Frontiers'24 for a comprehensive exploration of adversarial learning at the intersection with cutting-edge multimodal technologies, setting the stage for future advancements in adversarial machine learning. The workshop also hosts the 2024 AdvML Rising Star Award.

4+3 Phases of Compute-Optimal Neural Scaling Laws
We consider the three parameter solvable neural scaling model introduced by Maloney, Roberts, and Sully.  The model has three parameters: data complexity, target complexity, and model-parameter-count. We use this neural scaling model to derive new predictions about the compute-limited, infinite-data scaling law regime.  To train the neural scaling model, we run one-pass stochastic gradient descent on a mean-squared loss.  We derive a representation of the loss curves which holds over all iteration counts and improves in accuracy as the model parameter count grows.  We then analyze the compute-optimal model-parameter-count, and identify 4 phases (+3 subphases) in the data-complexity/target-complexity phase-plane.  The phase boundaries are determined by the relative importance of model capacity, optimizer noise, and embedding of the features. We furthermore derive, with mathematical proof and extensive numerical evidence, the scaling-law exponents in all of these phases, in particular computing the optimal model-parameter-count as a function of floating point operation budget.

4D Gaussian Splatting in the Wild with Uncertainty-Aware Regularization
Reconstructing dynamic scenes from monocular videos is very challenging, particularly in scenarios with rapid object motion or self-occlusion.While much progress has been made in dynamic scene synthesis based on neural radiance fields, existing methods struggle with slow inference or are limited to artificially captured videos.To address these challenges, we introduce UA-4DGS, a novel approach that renders clear free-view images of arbitrary dynamic scenes from in-the-wild monocular videos. To compensate for the lack of information from self-occlusion, we give diffusion priors to unseen views under considering the pixel-wise uncertainty score of the rendered image.It is the first local-adaptive regularization technique in neural radiance fields paradigms without problems of under-fitting on training images.Moreover, we first points out the initialization issue of Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes with fast motions, where Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques designed for static scenes yield missing initialization on dynamic regions. To tackle this problem, we introduce dynamic region densification, which improves reconstruction performance and memory efficiency.Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach by showing that incorporating uncertainty considerations into other NeRF regularization techniques can enhance their performance.

4Diffusion: Multi-view Video Diffusion Model for 4D Generation
Current 4D generation methods have achieved noteworthy efficacy with the aid of advanced diffusion generative models. However, these methods lack multi-view spatial-temporal modeling and encounter challenges in integrating diverse prior knowledge from multiple diffusion models, resulting in inconsistent temporal appearance and flickers. In this paper, we propose a novel 4D generation pipeline, named 4Diffusion, aimed at generating spatial-temporally consistent 4D content from a monocular video. We first design a unified diffusion model tailored for multi-view video generation by incorporating a learnable motion module into a frozen 3D-aware diffusion model to capture multi-view spatial-temporal correlations. After training on a curated dataset, our diffusion model acquires reasonable temporal consistency and inherently preserves the generalizability and spatial consistency of the 3D-aware diffusion model. Subsequently, we propose 4D-aware Score Distillation Sampling loss, which is based on our multi-view video diffusion model, to optimize 4D representation parameterized by dynamic NeRF. This aims to eliminate discrepancies arising from multiple diffusion models, allowing for generating spatial-temporally consistent 4D content. Moreover, we devise an anchor loss to enhance the appearance details and facilitate the learning of dynamic NeRF. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous methods.

4Real: Towards Photorealistic 4D Scene Generation via Video Diffusion Models
Existing dynamic scene generation methods mostly rely on distilling knowledge from pre-trained 3D generative models, which are typically fine-tuned on synthetic object datasets.As a result, the generated scenes are often object-centric and lack photorealism. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel pipeline designed for photorealistic text-to-4D scene generation, discarding the dependency on multi-view generative models and instead fully utilizing video generative models trained on diverse real-world datasets. Our method begins by generating a reference video using the video generation model.We then learn the canonical 3D representation of the video using a freeze-time video, delicately generated from the reference video.To handle inconsistencies in the freeze-time video, we jointly learn a per-frame deformation to model these imperfections.We then learn the temporal deformation based on the canonical representation to capture dynamic interactions in the reference video. The pipeline facilitates the generation of dynamic scenes with enhanced photorealism and structural integrity, viewable from multiple perspectives, thereby setting a new standard in 4D scene generation.

ABCFair: an Adaptable Benchmark approach for Comparing Fairness Methods
Numerous methods have been implemented that pursue fairness with respect to sensitive features by mitigating biases in machine learning. Yet, the problem settings that each method tackles vary significantly, including the stage of intervention, the composition of sensitive features, the fairness notion, and the distribution of the output. Even in binary classification, the greatest common denominator of problem settings is small, significantly complicating benchmarking.Hence, we introduce ABCFair, a benchmark approach which allows adapting to the desiderata of the real-world problem setting, enabling proper comparability between methods for any use case. We apply this benchmark to a range of pre-, in-, and postprocessing methods on both large-scale, traditional datasets and on a dual label (biased and unbiased) dataset to sidestep the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

A Benchmark Suite for Evaluating Neural Mutual Information Estimators on Unstructured Datasets
Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental metric for quantifying dependency between two random variables. When we can access only the samples, but not the underlying distribution functions, we can evaluate MI using sample-based estimators. Assessment of such MI estimators, however, has almost always relied on analytical datasets including Gaussian multivariates. Such datasets allow analytical calculations of the true MI values, but they are limited in that they do not reflect the complexities of real-world datasets. This study introduces a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating neural MI estimators on unstructured datasets, specifically focusing on images and texts. By leveraging same-class sampling for positive pairing and introducing a binary symmetric channel trick, we show that we can accurately manipulate true MI values of real-world datasets. Using the benchmark suite, we investigate seven challenging scenarios, shedding light on the reliability of neural MI estimators for unstructured datasets.

A Benchmark Suite for Systematically Evaluating Reasoning Shortcuts
The advent of powerful neural classifiers has increased interest in problems that require both learning and reasoning.These problems are critical for understanding important properties of models, such as trustworthiness, generalization, interpretability, and compliance to safety and structural constraints. However, recent research observed that tasks requiring both learning and reasoning on background knowledge often suffer from reasoning shortcuts (RSs): predictors can solve the downstream reasoning task without associating the correct concepts to the high-dimensional data. To address this issue, we introduce rsbench, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to systematically evaluate the impact of RSs on models by providing easy access to highly customizable tasks affected by RSs. Furthermore, rsbench implements common metrics for evaluating concept quality and introduces novel formal verification procedures for assessing the presence of RSs in learning tasks. Using rsbench, we highlight that obtaining high quality concepts in both purely neural and neuro-symbolic models is a far-from-solved problem. rsbench is available at: https://unitn-sml.github.io/rsbench.

A Best-of-both-worlds Algorithm for Bandits with Delayed Feedback with Robustness to Excessive Delays
We propose a new best-of-both-worlds algorithm for bandits with variably delayed feedback. In contrast to prior work, which required prior knowledge of the maximal delay $d_{\max}$ and had a linear dependence of the regret on it, our algorithm can tolerate arbitrary excessive delays up to order $T$ (where $T$ is the time horizon). The algorithm is based on three technical innovations, which may all be of independent interest: (1) We introduce the first implicit exploration scheme that works in best-of-both-worlds setting. (2) We introduce the first control of distribution drift that does not rely on boundedness of delays. The control is based on the implicit exploration scheme and adaptive skipping of observations with excessive delays. (3) We introduce a procedure relating standard regret with drifted regret that does not rely on boundedness of delays. At the conceptual level, we demonstrate that complexity of best-of-both-worlds bandits with delayed feedback is characterized by the amount of information missing at the time of decision making (measured by the number of outstanding observations) rather than the time that the information is missing (measured by the delays).

A Boosting-Type Convergence Result for AdaBoost.MH with Factorized Multi-Class Classifiers
AdaBoost is a well-known algorithm in boosting. Schapire and Singer propose, an extension of AdaBoost, named AdaBoost.MH, for multi-class classification problems. K´egl shows empirically that AdaBoost.MH works better when the classical one-against-all base classifiers are replaced by factorized base classifiers containing a binary classifier and a vote (or code) vector. However, the factorization makes it much more difficult to provide a convergence result for the factorized version of AdaBoost.MH. Then, K´egl raises an open problem in COLT 2014 to look for a lower bound for $w_\Sigma^\prime$, which is essential for analyzing the convergence result for the factorized AdaBoost.MH. In this work, we resolve this open problem by giving a lower bound for $w_\Sigma^\prime$ and present a convergence result for AdaBoost.MH with factorized multi-class classifiers.

Abstract Reward Processes: Leveraging State Abstraction for Consistent Off-Policy Evaluation
Evaluating policies using off-policy data is crucial for applying reinforcement learning to real-world problems such as healthcare and autonomous driving. Previous methods for *off-policy evaluation* (OPE) generally suffer from high variance or irreducible bias, leading to unacceptably high prediction errors. In this work, we introduce STAR, a framework for OPE that encompasses a broad range of estimators---which include existing OPE methods as special cases---that achieve lower mean squared prediction errors. STAR leverages state abstraction to distill complex, potentially continuous problems into compact, discrete models which we call *abstract reward processes* (ARPs). Predictions from ARPs estimated from off-policy data are provably consistent (asymptotically correct). Rather than proposing a specific estimator, we present a new framework for OPE and empirically demonstrate that estimators within STAR outperform existing methods. The best estimator outperforms baselines in all cases (12/12), with even the median estimator surpassing them in 7 out of 12 cases studied.

A Canonization Perspective on Invariant and Equivariant Learning
In many applications, we desire neural networks to exhibit invariance or equivariance to certain groups due to symmetries inherent in the data. Recently, frame-averaging methods emerged to be a unified framework for attaining symmetries efficiently by averaging over input-dependent subsets of the group, i.e., frames. What we currently lack is a principled understanding of the design of frames. In this work, we introduce a canonization perspective that provides an essential and complete view of the design of frames. Canonization is a classic approach for attaining invariance by mapping inputs to their canonical forms. We show that there exists an inherent connection between frames and canonical forms. Leveraging this connection, we can efficiently compare the complexity of frames as well as determine the optimality of certain frames. Guided by this principle, we design novel frames for eigenvectors that are strictly superior to existing methods --- some are even optimal --- both theoretically and empirically. The reduction to the canonization perspective further uncovers equivalences between previous methods. These observations suggest that canonization provides a fundamental understanding of existing frame-averaging methods and unifies existing equivariant and invariant learning methods.

A Cat Is A Cat (Not A Dog!): Unraveling Information Mix-ups in Text-to-Image Encoders through Causal Analysis and Embedding Optimization
This paper analyzes the impact of causal manner in the text encoder of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, which can lead to information bias and loss. Previous works have focused on addressing the issues through the denoising process. However, there is no research discussing how text embedding contributes to T2I models, especially when generating more than one object. In this paper, we share a comprehensive analysis of text embedding: i) how text embedding contributes to the generated images and ii) why information gets lost and biases towards the first-mentioned object. Accordingly, we propose a simple but effective text embedding balance optimization method, which is training-free, with an improvement of 90.05\% on information balance in stable diffusion. Furthermore, we propose a new automatic evaluation metric that quantifies information loss more accurately than existing methods, achieving 81\% concordance with human assessments. This metric effectively measures the presence and accuracy of objects, addressing the limitations of current distribution scores like CLIP's text-image similarities.

Accelerated Regularized Learning in Finite N-Person Games
Motivated by the success of Nesterov's accelerated gradient algorithm for convex minimization problems, we examine whether it is possible to achieve similar performance gains in the context of online learning in games.To that end, we introduce a family of accelerated learning methods, which we call “follow the accelerated leader” (FTXL), and which incorporates the use of momentum within the general framework of regularized learning - and, in particular, the exponential / multiplicative weights algorithm and its variants.Drawing inspiration and techniques from the continuous-time analysis of Nesterov's algorithm, we show that FTXL converges locally to strict Nash equilibria at a quadratic, superlinear rate, achieving in this way an exponential speed-up over vanilla regularized learning methods (which, by comparison, converge to strict equilibria at a geometric, linear rate).Importantly, the FTXL maintains its quadratic convergence rate in a broad range of feedback structures, from deterministic, full information models to stochastic, realization-based ones, and even bandit, payoff-based information, where players are only able to observe their individual realized payoffs.

Accelerating Diffusion Models with Parallel Sampling: Inference at Sub-Linear Time Complexity
Diffusion models have become a leading method for generative modeling of both image and scientific data.As these models are costly to train and \emph{evaluate}, reducing the inference cost for diffusion models remains a major goal.Inspired by the recent empirical success in accelerating diffusion models via the parallel sampling technique~\cite{shih2024parallel}, we propose to divide the sampling process into $\mathcal{O}(1)$ blocks with parallelizable Picard iterations within each block. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly} \log d)$ overall time complexity, marking \emph{the first implementation with provable sub-linear complexity w.r.t. the data dimension $d$}. Our analysis is based on a generalized version of Girsanov's theorem and is compatible with both the SDE and probability flow ODE implementations. Our results shed light on the potential of fast and efficient sampling of high-dimensional data on fast-evolving modern large-memory GPU clusters.

Accelerating Matroid Optimization through Fast Imprecise Oracles
Querying complex models for precise information (e.g. traffic models, database systems, large ML models) often entails intense computations and results in long response times. Thus, weaker models which give imprecise results quickly can be advantageous, provided inaccuracies can be resolved using few queries to a stronger model. In the fundamental problem of computing a maximum-weight basis of a matroid, a well-known generalization of many combinatorial optimization problems, algorithms have access to a clean oracle to query matroid information. We additionally equip algorithms with a fast but dirty oracle. We design and analyze practical algorithms which only use few clean queries w.r.t. the quality of the dirty oracle, while maintaining robustness against arbitrarily poor dirty oracles, approaching the performance of classic algorithms for the given problem. Notably, we prove that our algorithms are, in many respects, best-possible. Further, we outline extensions to other matroid oracle types, non-free dirty oracles and other matroid problems.

Accelerating Nash Equilibrium Convergence in Monte Carlo Settings Through Counterfactual Value Based Fictitious Play
Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and its variants are effective algorithms for solving extensive-form imperfect information games. Recently, many improvements have been made to enhance the convergence rate of the CFR algorithm, although most variants cannot be applied under Monte Carlo (MC) conditions. As a result, these variants are not suitable for training in large-scale games. Currently, the standard approach to large-scale games involves a “pre-trained blueprint strategy + real-time search” methodology. This process begins with the MCCFR algorithm to develop a blueprint strategy for the early stages of the game, followed by real-time searches during gameplay. Therefore, accelerating the MCCFR algorithm is crucial for the effective training of blueprint strategies in large-scale games.We propose a new MC-based algorithm for solving extensive-form imperfect information games, called MCCFVFP (Monte Carlo Counterfactual Value-Based Fictitious Play). MCCFVFP integrates CFR’s counterfactual value calculations with fictitious play’s best response strategy. This synthesis leverages the strengths of fictitious play, especially in games where over 90% of the strategies are dominated. In our tests, MCCFVFP achieved convergence speeds up to three times faster than the most advanced MCCFR variants and exhibited superior performance in games where over 90% of the strategies are dominated, achieving convergence speeds two orders of magnitude faster than MCCFR. Additionally, in large-scale settings like two-player limit short deck Texas Hold’em poker, the blueprint strategy developed by MCCFVFP outperformed the one developed by MCCFR within the same training duration.

Accelerating Relative Entropy Coding with Space Partitioning
Relative entropy coding (REC) algorithms encode a random sample following a target distribution $Q$, using a coding distribution $P$ shared between the sender and receiver. Sadly, general REC algorithms suffer from prohibitive encoding times, at least on the order of  $2^{D_{\text{KL}}[Q||P]}$, and faster algorithms are limited to very specific settings. This work addresses this issue by introducing a REC scheme utilizing space partitioning to reduce runtime in practical scenarios. We provide theoretical analyses of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness with both toy examples and practical applications. Notably, our method successfully handles REC tasks with $D_{\text{KL}}[Q||P]$ about three times greater than what previous methods can manage, and reduces the bitrate by approximately 5-15\% in VAE-based lossless compression on MNIST and INR-based lossy compression on CIFAR-10, compared to previous methods, significantly improving the practicality of REC for neural compression.

Accelerating Self-supervised Learning Pretraining
Our work tackles the computational challenges of contrastive learning methods, particularly for the pretraining of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Despite the effectiveness of contrastive learning, the substantial computational resources required for training often hinder their practical application. To mitigate this issue, we propose an acceleration framework, leveraging ViT's unique ability to generalize across inputs of varying sequence lengths. Our method employs a mix of sequence compression strategies, including randomized token dropout and flexible patch scaling, to reduce the cost of gradient estimation and accelerate convergence. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the gradient estimation error of various acceleration strategies and their performance on downstream tasks, offering valuable insights into the trade-offs between acceleration and performance.     We also propose a novel automated procedure to identify an optimal acceleration schedule that dynamically adjusts to the training progress, ensuring efficient training without sacrificing downstream performance. Our work significantly reduces the computational overhead of SSL training on the ImageNet dataset, making it more accessible to research communities and practitioners with limited computational resources. We achieve up to 4x speedup in model convergence, highlighting the potential of our methods to democratize SSL training for ViTs and other transformer-based models.

Accelerating Transformers with Spectrum-Preserving Token Merging
Increasing the throughput of the Transformer architecture, a foundational component used in numerous state-of-the-art models for vision and language tasks (e.g., GPT, LLaVa), is an important problem in machine learning. One recent and effective strategy is to merge token representations within Transformer models, aiming to reduce computational and memory requirements while maintaining accuracy. Prior work has proposed algorithms based on Bipartite Soft Matching (BSM), which divides tokens into distinct sets and merges the top $k$ similar tokens. However, these methods have significant drawbacks, such as sensitivity to token-splitting strategies and damage to informative tokens in later layers. This paper presents a novel paradigm called PiToMe, which prioritizes the preservation of informative tokens using an additional metric termed the \textit{energy score}. This score identifies large clusters of similar tokens as high-energy, indicating potential candidates for merging, while smaller (unique and isolated) clusters are considered as low-energy and preserved. Experimental findings demonstrate that PiToMe saved from 40-60\% FLOPs of the base models while exhibiting superior off-the-shelf performance on image classification (0.5\% average performance drop of ViT-MAEH compared to 2.6\% as baselines), image-text retrieval (0.3\% average performance drop of Clip on Flick30k compared to 4.5\% as others), and analogously in visual questions answering with LLaVa-7B. Furthermore, PiToMe is theoretically shown to preserve intrinsic spectral properties to the original token space under mild conditions.

Acceleration Exists! Optimization Problems When Oracle Can Only Compare Objective Function Values
Frequently, the burgeoning field of black-box optimization encounters challenges due to a limited understanding of the mechanisms of the objective function. To address such problems, in this work we focus on the deterministic concept of Order Oracle, which only utilizes order access between function values (possibly with some bounded noise), but without assuming access to their values. As theoretical results, we propose a new approach to create non-accelerated optimization algorithms (obtained by integrating Order Oracle into existing optimization “tools”) in non-convex, convex, and strongly convex settings that are as good as both SOTA coordinate algorithms with first-order oracle and SOTA algorithms with Order Oracle up to logarithm factor. Moreover, using the proposed approach, _we provide the first accelerated optimization algorithm using the Order Oracle_. And also, using an already different approach we provide the asymptotic convergence of _the first algorithm with the stochastic Order Oracle concept_. Finally, our theoretical results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed algorithms through numerical experiments.

Accurate and Steady Inertial Pose Estimation through Sequence Structure Learning and Modulation
Transformer models excel at capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, but lack explicit mechanisms to leverage structural patterns inherent in fixed-length input sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence structure learning and modulation approach that endows Transformers with the ability to model and utilize such fixed-sequence structural properties for improved performance on inertial pose estimation tasks.Specifically, our method introduces a Sequence Structure Module (SSM) that utilizes structural information of fixed-length inertial sensor readings to adjust the input features of transformers.Such structural information can either be acquired by learning or specified based on users' prior knowledge.To justify the prospect of our approach, we show that i) injecting spatial structural information of IMUs/joints learned from data improves accuracy, while ii) injecting temporal structural information based on smooth priors reduces jitter (i.e., improves steadiness), in a spatial-temporal transformer solution for inertial pose estimation.Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods and has the potential to advance the design of the transformer architecture for fixed-length sequences.

ACFun: Abstract-Concrete Fusion Facial Stylization
Owing to advancements in image synthesis techniques, stylization methodologies for large models have garnered remarkable outcomes. However, when it comes to processing facial images, the outcomes frequently fall short of expectations. Facial stylization is predominantly challenged by two significant hurdles. Firstly, obtaining a large dataset of high-quality stylized images is difficult. The scarcity and diversity of artistic styles make it impractical to compile comprehensive datasets for each style. Secondly, while many methods can transfer colors and strokes from style images, these elements alone cannot fully capture a specific style, which encompasses both concrete and abstract visual elements. Additionally, facial stylization often alters the visual features of the face, making it challenging to balance these changes with the need to retain facial information. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called ACFun, which uses only one style image and one facial image for facial stylization. ACFun comprises an Abstract Fusion Module (AFun) and a Concrete Fusion Module (CFun), which separately learn the abstract and concrete features of the style and face. We also design a Face and Style Imagery Alignment Loss to align the style image with the face image in the latent space. Finally, we generate styled facial images from noise directly to complete the facial stylization task. Experiments show that our method outperforms others in facial stylization, producing highly artistic and visually pleasing results.

Achievable distributional robustness when the robust risk is only partially identified
In safety-critical applications, machine learning models should generalize well under worst-case distribution shifts, that is, have a small robust risk. Invariance-based algorithms can provably take advantage of structural assumptions on the shifts when the training distributions are heterogeneous enough to identify the robust risk. However, in practice, such identifiability is often not given, and hence these methods lack guarantees. To evaluate distributional generalization in such scenarios, we propose to study the more general framework of partially identifiable robustness. This paper introduces this framework in the context of linear structural causal models for concreteness. Further, we define a new risk measure, the identifiable robust risk, and its corresponding (population) minimax quantity that is an algorithm-independent measure for the best achievable robustness under partial identifiability. We use this quantity to show how previous approaches provably achieve suboptimal robustness in the partially identifiable case. Finally, we demonstrate how the empirical minimizer of the identifiable robust risk also outperforms existing methods in finite-sample experiments.

Achievable Fairness on Your Data With Utility Guarantees
In machine learning fairness, training models that minimize disparity across different sensitive groups often leads to diminished accuracy, a phenomenon known as the fairness-accuracy trade-off. The severity of this trade-off inherently depends on dataset characteristics such as dataset imbalances or biases and therefore, using a uniform fairness requirement across diverse datasets remains questionable. To address this, we present a computationally efficient approach to approximate the fairness-accuracy trade-off curve tailored to individual datasets, backed by rigorous statistical guarantees. By utilizing the You-Only-Train-Once (YOTO) framework, our approach mitigates the computational burden of having to train multiple models when approximating the trade-off curve. Crucially, we introduce a novel methodology for quantifying uncertainty in our estimates, thereby providing practitioners with a robust framework for auditing model fairness while avoiding false conclusions due to estimation errors. Our experiments spanning tabular (e.g., Adult), image (CelebA), and language (Jigsaw) datasets underscore that our approach not only reliably quantifies the optimum achievable trade-offs across various data modalities but also helps detect suboptimality in SOTA fairness methods.

Achieving Domain-Independent Certified Robustness via Knowledge Continuity
We present *knowledge continuity*, a novel definition inspired by Lipschitz continuity which aims to certify the robustness of neural networks across input domains (such as continuous and discrete domains in vision and language, respectively). Most existing approaches that seek to certify robustness, especially Lipschitz continuity, lie within the continuous domain with norm and distribution-dependent guarantees. In contrast, our proposed definition yields certification guarantees that depend only on the loss function and the intermediate learned metric spaces of the neural network. These bounds are independent of domain modality, norms, and distribution. We further demonstrate that the expressiveness of a model class is not at odds with its knowledge continuity. This implies that achieving robustness by maximizing knowledge continuity should not theoretically hinder inferential performance.    Finally, we present several applications of knowledge continuity such as regularization and show that knowledge continuity can also localize vulnerable components of a neural network.

Achieving Linear Convergence with Parameter-Free Algorithms in Decentralized Optimization
This paper tackles (strongly) convex smooth optimization   in a network of agents without a centralized server. Existing decentralized algorithms require knowledge of problem and network parameters, such as the Lipschitz constants of the global gradient or network information, which agents usually cannot access. This leads to conservative hyperparameter selections and slow convergence or divergence. This paper  introduces a   decentralized algorithm that eliminates the need for specific parameter tuning. Our approach employs  an operator splitting technique with a novel variable metric, enabling a local backtracking line-search to adaptively select the learning rate without global information or extensive communication. This results in   favorable convergence guarantees and dependence on optimization and network parameters compared to existing nonadaptive methods. Notably, our method is the first *adaptive* decentralized algorithm to achieve linear convergence for strongly convex functions. Numerical experiments on machine learning problems demonstrate superior performance in convergence speed and scalability, particularly in scenarios where conventional methods fail due to stepsize limitations.

Achieving Near-Optimal Convergence for Distributed Minimax Optimization with Adaptive Stepsizes
In this paper, we show that applying adaptive methods directly to distributed minimax problems can result in non-convergence due to inconsistency in locally computed adaptive stepsizes. To address this challenge, we propose D-AdaST, a Distributed Adaptive minimax method with Stepsize Tracking. The key strategy is to employ an adaptive stepsize tracking protocol involving the transmission of two extra (scalar) variables. This protocol ensures the consistency among stepsizes of nodes, eliminating the steady-state error due to the lack of coordination of stepsizes among nodes that commonly exists in vanilla distributed adaptive methods, and thus guarantees exact convergence. For nonconvex-strongly-concave distributed minimax problems, we characterize the specific transient times that ensure time-scale separation of stepsizes and quasi-independence of networks, leading to a near-optimal convergence rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \epsilon ^{-\left( 4+\delta \right)} \right)$ for any small $\delta > 0$, matching that of the centralized counterpart. To our best knowledge, D-AdaST is the *first* distributed adaptive method achieving near-optimal convergence without knowing any problem-dependent parameters for nonconvex minimax problems. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical results.

Achieving Optimal Clustering in Gaussian Mixture Models with Anisotropic Covariance Structures
We study clustering under anisotropic Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), where covariance matrices from different clusters are unknown and are not necessarily the identical matrix. We analyze two anisotropic scenarios: homogeneous, with identical covariance matrices, and heterogeneous, with distinct matrices per cluster. For these models, we derive minimax lower bounds that illustrate the critical influence of covariance structures on clustering accuracy. To solve the clustering problem, we propose a variant of Lloyd's algorithm, adapted to estimate and utilize covariance information iteratively. We prove that the adjusted algorithm not only adheres to the minimax optimality but also converges within logarithmic iterations, bridging the gap between theoretical robustness and practical efficiency.

Achieving Tractable Minimax Optimal Regret in Average Reward MDPs
In recent years, significant attention has been directed towards learning average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).However, existing algorithms either encounter suffer of sub-optimal regret guarantees or computational inefficiencies.In this paper, we present the first *tractable* algorithm  with minimax optimal regret of $\widetilde{\mathrm{O}}\left(\sqrt{\mathrm{sp}(h^*) S A T}\right)$ ($\widetilde{\mathrm{O}}(\cdot)$ hides logarithmic factors of $(S,A,T)$) where $\mathrm{sp}(h^*)$ is the span of the optimal bias function $h^*$, $S\times A$  is the size of the state-action space and $T$ the number of learning steps. Remarkably, our algorithm does not require prior information on $\mathrm{sp}(h^*)$. Our algorithm relies on a novel subroutine, **P**rojected **M**itigated **E**xtended **V**alue **I**teration (`PMEVI`), to compute bias-constrained optimal policies efficiently. This subroutine can be applied to various previous algorithms to obtain improved regret bounds.

A Closer Look at AUROC and AUPRC under Class Imbalance
In machine learning (ML), a widespread claim is that the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is a superior metric for model comparison to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for tasks with class imbalance. This paper refutes this notion on two fronts. First, we theoretically characterize the behavior of AUROC and AUPRC in the presence of model mistakes, establishing clearly that AUPRC is not generally superior in cases of class imbalance. We further show that AUPRC can be a harmful metric as it can unduly favor model improvements in subpopulations with more frequent positive labels, heightening algorithmic disparities. Next, we empirically support our theory using experiments on both semi-synthetic and real-world fairness datasets. Prompted by these insights, we conduct a review of over 1.5 million scientific papers to understand the origin of this invalid claim, finding that it is often made without citation, misattributed to papers that do not argue this point, and aggressively over-generalized from source arguments. Our findings represent a dual contribution: a significant technical advancement in understanding the relationship between AUROC and AUPRC and a stark warning about unchecked assumptions in the ML community.

A Closer Look at Deep Learning Phenomena Through A Telescoping Lens
The remarkable recent progress in deep learning has been fueled by the development of a multifaceted understanding of neural networks through several complementary viewpoints. In this work, we further contribute to this effort by examining a tractable and accurate model of a neural network consisting of a sequence of first-order approximations telescoping out into a single, empirically operational tool for practical analysis. We demonstrate that this model presents a pedagogical formalism allowing us to isolate components of the training process even in complex contemporary settings, providing a sharp lens to reason about the effects of design choices such as architecture and optimization strategy, and reveals surprising parallels between neural network learning and gradient boosting. We then illustrate how it can be applied to derive new empirical insights on a diverse range of prominent phenomena in the literature -- including double descent, grokking, linear mode connectivity and the challenges of applying deep learning on tabular data.

A Compositional Atlas for Algebraic Circuits
Circuits based on sum-product structure have become a ubiquitous representation to compactly encode knowledge, from Boolean functions to probability distributions. By imposing constraints on the structure of such circuits, certain inference queries become tractable, such as model counting and most probable configuration. Recent works have explored analyzing probabilistic and causal inference queries as compositions of basic operations to derive tractability conditions. In this paper, we take an algebraic perspective for compositional inference, and show that a large class of queries---including marginal MAP, probabilistic answer set programming inference, and causal backdoor adjustment---correspond to a combination of basic operations over semirings: aggregation, product, and elementwise mapping. Using this framework, we uncover simple and general sufficient conditions for tractable composition of these operations, in terms of circuit properties (e.g., marginal determinism, compatibility) and conditions on the elementwise mappings. Applying our analysis, we derive novel tractability conditions for many such compositional queries. Our results unify tractability conditions for existing problems on circuits, while providing a blueprint for analysing novel compositional inference queries.

A Comprehensive Analysis on the Learning Curve in Kernel Ridge Regression
This paper conducts a comprehensive study of the learning curves of kernel ridge regression (KRR) under minimal assumptions.Our contributions are three-fold: 1) we analyze the role of key properties of the kernel, such as its spectral eigen-decay and the characteristics of the eigenfunctions; 2) we demonstrate the validity of the Gaussian Equivalent Property (GEP), which states that the generalization performance of KRR remains the same when the whitened features are replaced by standard Gaussian vectors, thereby shedding light on the analysis success under the Gaussian Design Assumption in previous literature; 3) we derive novel bounds that improves over existing bounds across various settings.

A Comprehensive Investigation of Sparse Rate Reduction in Transformer-like Models
Deep neural networks have been criticized for their black-box nature for a long period of time. A recent work proposed an information-theoretic objective function called Sparse Rate Reduction (SRR) and interpreted its unrolled optimization as a Transformer-like model called Coding Rate Reduction Transformer (CRATE), taking steps to unveil the inner mechanism of modern neural architecture. However, they only consider the simplest implementation, and whether this objective is optimized in practice and its causal relationship to generalization remain elusive. To this end, we derive different implementations by analyzing layer-wise behaviors of CRATE, both theoretically and empirically. In order to reveal the predictive power of SRR on model generalization, we collect a set of model variants induced from different implementations and hyperparameters and evaluate SRR as a complexity measure based on its correlation with generalization. Surprisingly, we find out that SSR has positive correlation with generalization and outperforms other baseline measures such as path-norm and sharpness-based ones. Furthermore, we show that model generalization can be improved using SRR as regularization on various benchmark datasets. We hope this paper can pave the way for using SSR to design principled models and study their generalization ability.

A Consistency-Aware Spot-Guided Transformer for Versatile and Hierarchical Point Cloud Registration
Deep learning-based feature matching has shown great superiority for point cloud registration in the absence of pose priors. Although coarse-to-fine matching approaches are prevalent, the coarse matching of existing methods is typically sparse and loose without consideration of geometric consistency, which makes the subsequent fine matching rely on ineffective optimal transport and hypothesis-verification methods for consistency. Therefore, these methods are neither efficient nor scalable for real-time applications such as odometry in robotics. To address these issues, we design a consistency-aware spot-guided Transformer (CAST), which incorporates a spot-guided cross-attention module to avoid interfering with irrelevant areas, and a consistency-aware self-attention module to enhance matching capabilities with spatial consistent correspondences. Furthermore, a lightweight fine matching module for both sparse keypoints and dense features can estimate the transformation accurately. Extensive experiments on both outdoor LiDAR point cloud datasets and indoor RGBD point cloud datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

ActAnywhere: Subject-Aware Video Background Generation
We study a novel problem to automatically generate video background that tailors to foreground subject motion. It is an important problem for the movie industry and visual effects community, which traditionally requires tedious manual efforts to solve. To this end, we propose ActAnywhere, a video diffusion model that takes as input a sequence of foreground subject segmentation and an image of a novel background and generates a video of the subject interacting in this background. We train our model on a large-scale dataset of 2.4M videos of human-scene interactions. Through extensive evaluation, we show that our model produces videos with realistic foreground-background interaction while strictly following the guidance of the condition image. Our model generalizes to diverse scenarios including non-human subjects, gaming and animation clips, as well as videos with multiple moving subjects. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods, which fail to accomplish the studied task.

Action Imitation in Common Action Space for Customized Action Image Synthesis
We propose a novel method, \textbf{TwinAct}, to tackle the challenge of decoupling actions and actors in order to customize the text-guided diffusion models (TGDMs) for few-shot action image generation. TwinAct addresses the limitations of existing methods that struggle to decouple actions from other semantics (e.g., the actor's appearance) due to the lack of an effective inductive bias with few exemplar images. Our approach introduces a common action space, which is a textual embedding space focused solely on actions, enabling precise customization without actor-related details. Specifically, TwinAct involves three key steps: 1) Building common action space based on a set of representative action phrases; 2) Imitating the customized action within the action space; and 3) Generating highly adaptable customized action images in diverse contexts with action similarity loss. To comprehensively evaluate TwinAct, we construct a novel benchmark, which provides sample images with various forms of actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TwinAct's superiority in generating accurate, context-independent customized actions while maintaining the identity consistency of different subjects, including animals, humans, and even customized actors.

Activating Self-Attention for Multi-Scene Absolute Pose Regression
Multi-scene absolute pose regression has emerged to meet the need for speed and memory efficiency in camera pose estimation in multi-scene real-world scenario. Nowadays, transformer-based model has been devised to regress the camera pose directly in multi-scenes. Despite its potential, transformer encoders are underutilized due to the collapsed self-attention map, having low representation capacity. This work highlights the problem and investigates it from a new perspective: distortion of query-key embedding space. Based on the statistical analysis, we reveal that queries and keys are mapped in completely different spaces while only a few keys are blended into the query region. This leads to the collapse of the self-attention map, as all queries are considered similar to those few keys. Therefore, we propose simple but effective solutions to activate self-attention. Concretely, we present an auxiliary loss that aligns queries and keys, preventing the distortion of query-key space and encouraging the model to find global relations by self-attention. In addition, the fixed sinusoidal positional encoding is adopted instead of undertrained learnable one to reflect appropriate positional clues into the inputs of self-attention. As a result, our approach resolves the aforementioned problem successfully, thus outperforming existing methods in both outdoor and indoor scenes.

Activation Map Compression through Tensor Decomposition for Deep Learning
Internet of Things and Deep Learning are synergetically exponentially growing industrial fields with a massive call for their unification into a common framework called Edge AI. While on-device inference is a well-explored topic in recent research, backpropagation remains an open challenge due to its prohibitive computational and memory costs compared to the extreme resource constraints of embedded devices. Drawing on tensor decomposition research, we tackle the major bottleneck in backpropagation, namely the memory footprint of activation map storage. We investigate and compare the effects of activation compression using Singular Value Decomposition and its tensor variant, High-Order Singular Value Decomposition. The application of low-order decomposition enables considerable memory savings while preserving the features being essential for learning, providing as well theoretical guarantees to convergence. Experimental results obtained on main-stream architectures and tasks demonstrate its Pareto-superiority over other state-of-the-art solutions, in terms of the trade-off between generalization and memory footprint.

Active Classification with Few Queries under Misspecification
We study pool-based active learning, where a learner has a large pool $S$ of unlabeled examples and can adaptively ask a labeler questions to learn these labels. The goal of the learner is to output a labeling for $S$ that can compete with the best hypothesis from a given hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$. We focus on halfspace learning, one of the most important problems in active learning.It is well known that in the standard active learning model, learning the labels of an arbitrary pool of examples labeled by some halfspace up to error $\epsilon$ requires at least $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ queries. To overcome this difficulty, previous work designs simple but powerful query languages to achieve $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ query complexity, but only focuses on the realizable setting where data are perfectly labeled by some halfspace.However, when labels are noisy, such queries are too fragile and lead to high query complexity even under the simple random classification noise model.  In this work, we propose a new query language called threshold statistical queries and study their power for learning under various noise models. Our main algorithmic result is the first query-efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces under the popular Massart noise model. With an arbitrary dataset corrupted with Massart noise at noise rate $\eta$, our algorithm uses only $\mathrm{polylog(1/\epsilon)}$ threshold statistical queries and computes an $(\eta + \epsilon)$-accurate labeling in polynomial time. For the harder case of agnostic noise, we show that it is impossible to beat $O(1/\epsilon)$ query complexity even for the much simpler problem of learning singleton functions (and thus for learning halfspaces) using a reduction from agnostic distributed learning.

Active Learning for Derivative-Based Global Sensitivity Analysis with Gaussian Processes
We consider the problem of active learning for global sensitivity analysis of expensive black-box functions. Our aim is to efficiently learn the importance of different input variables, e.g., in vehicle safety experimentation, we study the impact of the thickness of various components on safety objectives. Since function evaluations are expensive, we use active learning to prioritize experimental resources where they yield the most value. We propose novel active learning acquisition functions that directly target key quantities of derivative-based global sensitivity measures (DGSMs) under Gaussian process surrogate models.We showcase the first application of active learning directly to DGSMs, and develop tractable uncertainty reduction and information gain acquisition functions for these measures. Through comprehensive evaluation on synthetic and real-world problems, our study demonstrates how these active learning acquisition strategies substantially enhance the sample efficiency of DGSM estimation, particularly with limited evaluation budgets. Our work paves the way for more efficient and accurate sensitivity analysis in various scientific and engineering applications.

Active Learning of General Halfspaces: Label Queries vs Membership Queries
We study the problem of learning general (i.e., not necessarily homogeneous) halfspaces under the Gaussian distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in the presence of some form of query access. In the classical pool-based active learning model, where the algorithm isallowed to make adaptive label queries to previously sampled points, we establish a strong information-theoretic lower bound ruling out non-trivialimprovements over the passive setting. Specifically, we show thatany active learner requires label complexity of $\tilde{\Omega}(d/(\log(m)\epsilon))$, where $m$ is the number of unlabeled examples. Specifically, to beat the passive label complexity of $\tilde{O}(d/\epsilon)$, an active learner requires a pool of $2^{\mathrm{poly}(d)}$ unlabeled samples.On the positive side, we show that this lower bound can be circumvented with membership query access, even in the agnostic model. Specifically, we give a computationally efficient learner with query complexity of $\tilde{O}(\min(1/p, 1/\epsilon) + d\mathrm{polylog}(1/\epsilon))$achieving error guarantee of $O(\mathrm{opt}+\epsilon)$. Here $p \in [0, 1/2]$ is the bias and $\mathrm{opt}$ is the 0-1 loss of the optimal halfspace. As a corollary, we obtain a strong separation between the active and membership query models. Taken together, our results characterize the complexity of learning general halfspaces under Gaussian marginals in these models.

Active preference learning for ordering items in- and out-of-sample
Learning an ordering of items based on pairwise comparisons is useful when items are difficult to rate consistently on an absolute scale, for example, when annotators have to make subjective assessments. When exhaustive comparison is infeasible, actively sampling item pairs can reduce the number of annotations necessary for learning an accurate ordering. However, many algorithms ignore shared structure between items, limiting their sample efficiency and precluding generalization to new items. It is also common to disregard how noise in comparisons varies between item pairs, despite it being informative of item similarity. In this work, we study active preference learning for ordering items with contextual attributes, both in- and out-of-sample. We give an upper bound on the expected ordering error of a logistic preference model as a function of which items have been compared. Next, we propose an active learning strategy that samples items to minimize this bound by accounting for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in comparisons. We evaluate the resulting algorithm, and a variant aimed at reducing model misspecification, in multiple realistic ordering tasks with comparisons made by human annotators. Our results demonstrate superior sample efficiency and generalization compared to non-contextual ranking approaches and active preference learning baselines.

Active Set Ordering
In this paper, we formalize the active set ordering problem, which involves actively discovering a set of inputs based on their orderings determined by expensive evaluations of a blackbox function. We then propose the mean prediction (MP) algorithm and theoretically analyze it  in terms of the regret of predicted pairwise orderings between inputs. Notably, as a special case of this framework, we can cast Bayesian optimization as an active set ordering problem by recognizing that maximizers can be identified solely by comparison rather than by precisely estimating the function evaluations. As a result, we are able to construct the popular Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) algorithm through the lens of ordering with several nuanced insights. We empirically validate the performance of our proposed solution using various synthetic functions and real-world datasets.

AdaFlow
Diffusion-based imitation learning improves Behavioral Cloning (BC) on multi-modal decision-making, but comes at the cost of significantly slower inference due to the recursion in the diffusion process. It urges us to design efficient policy generators while keeping the ability to generate diverse actions. To address this challenge, we propose AdaFlow, an imitation learning framework based on flow-based generative modeling. AdaFlow represents the policy with state-conditioned ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are known as probability flows. We reveal an intriguing connection between the conditional variance of their training loss and the discretization error of the ODEs.With this insight, we propose a variance-adaptive ODE solver that can adjust its step size in the inference stage, makingAdaFlow an adaptive decision-maker, offering rapid inference without sacrificing diversity. Interestingly, it automatically reduces to a one-step generator when the action distribution is uni-modal. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation shows that AdaFlow achieves high performance with fast inference speed.

AdanCA: Neural Cellular Automata As Adaptors For More Robust Vision Transformer
Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in image classification tasks, particularly when equipped with local information via region attention or convolutions. While such architectures improve the feature aggregation from different granularities, they often fail to contribute to the robustness of the networks. Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) enables the modeling of global cell representations through local interactions, with its training strategies and architecture design conferring strong generalization ability and robustness against noisy input. In this paper, we propose Adaptor Neural Cellular Automata (AdaNCA) for Vision Transformer that uses NCA as plug-in-play adaptors between ViT layers, enhancing ViT’s performance and robustness against adversarial samples as well as out-of-distribution inputs. To overcome the large computational overhead of standard NCAs, we propose Dynamic Interaction for more efficient interaction learning. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm for identifying the most effective insertion points for AdaNCA based on our analysis of AdaNCA placement and robustness improvement. With less than a 3% increase in parameters, AdaNCA contributes to more than 10% absolute improvement in accuracy under adversarial attacks on the ImageNet1K benchmark. Moreover, we demonstrate with extensive evaluations across 8 robustness benchmarks and 4 ViT architectures that AdaNCA, as a plug-in-play module, consistently improves the robustness of ViTs.

AdaPKC: PeakConv with Adaptive Peak Receptive Field for Radar Semantic Segmentation
Deep learning-based radar detection technology is receiving increasing attention in areas such as autonomous driving, UAV surveillance, and marine monitoring. Among recent efforts, PeakConv (PKC) provides a solution that can retain the peak response characteristics of radar signals and play the characteristics of deep convolution, thereby improving the effect of radar semantic segmentation (RSS). However, due to the use of a pre-set fixed peak receptive field sampling rule, PKC still has limitations in dealing with problems such as inconsistency of target frequency domain response broadening, non-homogeneous and time-varying characteristic of noise/clutter distribution, etc. Therefore, this paper proposes an idea of adaptive peak receptive field, and upgrades PKC to AdaPKC based on this idea. Beyond that, a novel fine-tuning technology to further boost the performance of AdaPKC-based RSS networks is presented. Through experimental verification using various real-measured radar data (including publicly available low-cost millimeter-wave radar dataset for autonomous driving and self-collected Ku-band surveillance radar dataset), we found that the performance of AdaPKC-based models surpasses other SoTA methods in RSS tasks. Our code is anonymized at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AdaPKC for review purpose.

Adapting Diffusion Models for Improved Prompt Compliance and Controllable Image Synthesis
Recent advances in generative modeling with diffusion processes (DPs) enabled breakthroughs in image synthesis. Despite impressive image quality, these models have various prompt compliance problems, including low recall in generating multiple objects, difficulty in generating text in images, and meeting constraints like object locations and pose. For fine-grained editing and manipulation, they also require fine-grained semantic or instance maps that are tedious to produce manually. While prompt compliance can be enhanced by addition of loss functions at inference, this is time consuming and does not scale to complex scenes.   To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a new family of  $\textit{Factor Graph Diffusion Models}$ (FG-DMs) that models the joint distribution of images and conditioning variables, such as semantic, sketch, depth or normal maps via a factor graph decomposition. This joint structure has several advantages, including support for efficient sampling based prompt compliance schemes, which produce images of high object recall, semi-automated fine-grained editing, explainability at intermediate levels, ability to produce labeled datasets for the training of downstream models such as segmentation or depth, training with missing data, and continual learning where new conditioning variables can be added with minimal or no modifications to the existing structure. We propose an implementation of FG-DMs by adapting a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model to implement all FG-DM factors, using only COCO dataset, and show that it is effective in generating images with 15\% higher recall than SD while retaining its generalization ability. We introduce an attention distillation loss that encourages consistency among the attention maps of all factors, improving the fidelity of the generated conditions and image. We also show that training FG-DMs from scratch on MM-CelebA-HQ, Cityscapes, ADE20K, and COCO produce images of high quality (FID) and diversity (LPIPS).

Adapting to Unknown Low-Dimensional Structures in Score-Based Diffusion Models
This paper investigates score-based diffusion models when the underlying target distribution is concentrated on or near low-dimensional manifolds within the higher-dimensional space in which they formally reside, a common characteristic of natural image distributions. Despite previous efforts to understand the data generation process of diffusion models, existing theoretical support remains highly suboptimal in the presence of low-dimensional structure, which we strengthen in this paper.  For the popular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), we find that the dependency of the error incurred within each denoising step on the ambient dimension $d$ is in general unavoidable. We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner.

Adaptive Depth Networks with Skippable Sub-Paths
Predictable adaptation of network depths can be an effective way to control inference latency and meet the resource condition of various devices. However, previous adaptive depth networks do not provide general principles and a formal explanation on why and which layers can be skipped, and, hence, their approaches are hard to be generalized and require long and complex training steps. In this paper, we present a practical approach to adaptive depth networks that is applicable to various networks with minimal training effort. In our approach, every hierarchical residual stage is divided into two sub-paths, and they are trained to acquire different properties through a simple self-distillation strategy. While the first sub-path is essential for hierarchical feature learning, the second one is trained to refine the learned features and minimize performance degradation if it is skipped. Unlike prior adaptive networks, our approach does not train every target sub-network in an iterative manner. At test time, however, we can connect these sub-paths in a combinatorial manner to select sub-networks of various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs from a single network. We provide a formal rationale for why the proposed training method can reduce overall prediction errors while minimizing the impact of skipping sub-paths. We demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our approach with convolutional neural networks and transformers.

Adaptive Domain Learning for Cross-domain Image Denoising
Different camera sensors have different noise patterns, and thus an image denoising model trained on one sensor often does not generalize well to a different sensor. One plausible solution is to collect a large dataset for each sensor for training or fine-tuning, which is inevitably time-consuming. To address this cross-domain challenge, we present a novel adaptive domain learning (ADL) scheme for cross-domain RAW image denoising by utilizing existing data from different sensors (source domain) plus a small amount of data from the new sensor (target domain). The ADL training scheme automatically removes the data in the source domain that are harmful to fine-tuning a model for the target domain (some data are harmful as adding them during training lowers the performance due to domain gaps). Also, we introduce a modulation module to adopt sensor-specific information (sensor type and ISO) to understand input data for image denoising. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets with various smartphone and DSLR cameras, which show our proposed model outperforms prior work on cross-domain image denoising, given a small amount of image data from the target domain sensor.

Adaptive Experimentation When You Can't Experiment
This paper introduces the confounded pure exploration transductive linear bandit (CPET-LB) problem. As a motivating example,  often online services cannot directly assign users to specific control or treatment experiences either for business or practical reasons. In these settings, naively comparing treatment and control groups that may result from self-selection can lead to biased estimates of underlying treatment effects. Instead, online services can employ a properly randomized encouragement that incentivizes users toward a specific treatment. Our methodology provides online services with an adaptive experimental design approach for learning the best-performing treatment for such encouragement designs. We consider a more general underlying model captured by a linear structural equation and formulate pure exploration linear bandits in this setting. Though pure exploration has been extensively studied in standard adaptive experimental design settings, we believe this is the first work considering a setting where noise is confounded.  Elimination-style algorithms using experimental design methods in combination with a novel finite-time confidence interval on an instrumental variable style estimator are presented with sample complexity upper bounds nearly matching a minimax lower bound. Finally, experiments are conducted that demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

Adaptive Labeling for Efficient Out-of-distribution Model Evaluation
Previously collected data often suffer severe selection bias when ground truth labels are costly. To assess model performance outside the support of available data, we present a computational framework for adaptive labeling, providing cost-efficient model evaluations under severe distribution shifts. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process over states defined by posterior beliefs on model performance. Each batch of new labels incurs a “state transition” to sharper beliefs, and we choose batches to minimize overall uncertainty on model performance. Instead of relying on high-variance REINFORCE policy gradient estimators that do not scale, our adaptive labeling policy is optimized using path-wise policy gradients computed by auto-differentiating through simulated roll-outs. Our framework is agnostic to different uncertainty quantification approaches and highlights the virtue of planning in adaptive labeling. On synthetic and real datasets, we empirically demonstrate even a one-step lookahead policy substantially outperforms active learning-inspired heuristics.

Adaptive Sampling for Efficient Softmax Approximation
The softmax function is ubiquitous in machine learning and optimization applications. Computing the full softmax function of a matrix vector product can be computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. In many applications, however, it is sufficient to calculate only the top few outputs of the softmax function.  In this work we present present an algorithm, dubbed AdaptiveSoftmax, that adaptively computes the top $k$ softmax values more efficiently than the full softmax computation. We provide PAC guarantees for AdaptiveSoftmax and demonstrate that it is more sample-efficient than the full softmax computation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaptiveSoftmax on real and synthetic data to corroborate our theoretical results. On some datasets, such as the EuroSAT dataset, AdaptiveSoftmax has several hundred times lower sample complexity than the full softmax computation, with gains often on the order of 10x. The adaptive method we propose for estimating the partition function (the softmax denominator) is of independent interest, and can be used in other applications such as kernel density estimation.

Addressing Hidden Confounding with Heterogeneous Observational Datasets for Recommendation
The collected data in recommender systems generally suffers selection bias. Considerable works are proposed to address selection bias induced by observed user and item features, but they fail when hidden features (e.g., user age or salary) that affect both user selection mechanism and feedback exist, which is called hidden confounding. To tackle this issue, methods based on sensitivity analysis and leveraging a few RCT data for model calibration have been proposed. However, the former relies on strong assumptions of hidden confounding strength, whereas the latter relies on the expensive RCT data, thereby limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose to employ heterogeneous observational data to address hidden confounding, wherein some data is subject to hidden confounding while the remaining is not. We argue that such setup is more aligned with practical scenarios, especially when some users do not have complete personal information (thus assumed with hidden confounding), while others do have (thus assumed without hidden confounding). To achieve unbiased learning, we propose a novel meta-learning based debiasing method called MetaDebias, to explicitly model the oracle prediction errors and the additional bias introduced by hidden confounding, and bi-level optimization is used  for model training. Extensive experiments on three public datasets validate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the presence of hidden confounding, regardless of RCT data availability.

Addressing Spectral Bias of Deep Neural Networks by Multi-Grade Deep Learning
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have showcased their remarkable precision in approximating smooth functions. However, they suffer from the {\it spectral bias}, wherein DNNs typically exhibit a tendency to prioritize learning of lower-frequency components of a function, struggling to effectively capture its high-frequency features. This paper is to address this issue. By observing that a function having only low frequency components can be well-represented by a shallow neural network (SNN), a network having only a few layers, and that composition of low frequency functions can effectively approximate a high-frequency function, we propose to learn a function containing high-frequency components by compositing several SNNs, each of which learns certain low-frequency information from the given data. We implement the proposed idea by exploiting the multi-grade deep learning (MGDL) model, a recently introduced model that trains DNNs incrementally, grade by grade, with each grade training an SNN from the residue of the previous grade. We apply MGDL to synthetic, manifold, and MNIST datasets, all characterized by presence of high-frequency features. Our study reveals that MGDL excels at representing functions containing high-frequency information. Specifically, the neural network learned in each grade adeptly capture some low-frequency information, allowing its compositions with neural networks learned in previous grades effectively represent the high-frequency features. Our experimental results underscore the efficacy of MGDL in addressing the spectral bias inherent in DNNs. By leveraging MGDL, we offer insights into overcoming spectral bias limitation of DNNs, thereby enhancing the performance and applicability of deep learning models in tasks requiring the representation of high-frequency information. This study confirms that the proposed method offers a promising solution to address the spectral bias of DNNs.

AdjointDEIS: Efficient Gradients for Diffusion Models
The optimization of the latents and parameters of diffusion models with respect to some differentiable metric defined on the output of the model is a challenging and complex problem. The sampling for diffusion models is done by solving either the *probability flow* ODE or diffusion SDE wherein a neural network approximates the score function, or related quantity, allowing a numerical ODE/SDE solver to be used. However, naive backpropogation techniques are memory intensive, requiring the storage of all intermediate states, and face additional complexity in handling the injected noise from the diffusion term of the diffusion SDE. We propose a novel method based on the *stochastic adjoint sensitivity method* to calculate the gradients with respect to the initial noise, conditional information, and model parameters by solving an additional SDE whose solution is the gradient of the diffusion SDE. We exploit the unique construction of diffusion SDEs to further simplify the formulation of the adjoint diffusion SDE and use a change-of-variables to simplify the solution to an exponentially weighted integral. Using this formulation we derive a custom solver for the adjoint SDE as well as the simpler adjoint ODE. The proposed adjoint diffusion solvers can efficiently compute the gradients for both the *probability flow* ODE and diffusion SDE for latents and parameters of the model. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the adjoint diffusion solvers on the face morphing problem

ADOPT: Modified Adam Can Converge with Any $\beta_2$ with the Optimal Rate
Adam is one of the most popular optimization algorithms in deep learning. However, it is known that Adam does not converge in theory unless choosing a hyperparameter, i.e., $\beta_2$, in a problem-dependent manner. There have been many attempts to fix the non-convergence (e.g., AMSGrad), but they require an impractical assumption that the gradient noise is uniformly bounded. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive gradient method named ADOPT, which achieves the optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O} ( 1 / \sqrt{T} )$ with any choice of $\beta_2$ without depending on the bounded noise assumption. ADOPT addresses the non-convergence issue of Adam by removing the current gradient from the second moment estimate and changing the order of the momentum update and the normalization by the second moment estimate. We also conduct intensive numerical experiments, and verify that our ADOPT achieves superior results compared to Adam and its variants across a wide range of tasks, including image classification, generative modeling, natural language processing, and deep reinforcement learning.

AdvAD: Exploring Non-Parametric Diffusion for Imperceptible Adversarial Attacks
Imperceptible adversarial attacks aim to fool DNNs by adding imperceptible perturbation to the input data. Previous methods typically improve the imperceptibility of attacks by integrating common attack paradigms with specifically designed perception-based losses or the capabilities of generative models. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Attacks in Diffusion (AdvAD), a novel modeling framework distinct from existing attack paradigms. AdvAD innovatively conceptualizes attacking as a non-parametric diffusion process by theoretically exploring basic modeling approach rather than using the denoising or generation abilities of regular diffusion models with neural networks. At each step, much subtler yet effective adversarial guidance is crafted using only the attacked model without any additional network, which gradually leads the end of diffusion process from the original image to a desired imperceptible adversarial example. Grounded in a solid theory of the proposed non-parametric diffusion process, AdvAD achieves high attack efficacy and imperceptibility with intrinsically lower overall perturbation strength. Additionally, an enhanced version AdvAD-X is proposed to evaluate the extreme performance of our modeling framework under an ideal scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AdvAD and AdvAD-X. Compared with state-of-the-art imperceptible attacks, AdvAD achieves an average of 99.9$\%$ (+17.3%) ASR with 1.34 (-0.97) l2 distance, 49.74 (+4.76) PSNR and 0.9974 (+0.0043) SSIM against four prevalent DNNs with three different architectures on the ImageNet-compatible dataset.

Advancing Fine-Grained Classification by Structure and Subject Preserving Augmentation
Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) involves classifying closely related subcategories. This task is inherently difficult due to the subtle differences between classes and the high intra-class variance. Moreover, FGVC datasets are typically small and challenging to gather, thus highlighting a significant need for effective data augmentation.Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have introduced new possibilities for data augmentation in image classification. While these models have been used to generate training data for classification tasks, their effectiveness in full-dataset training of FGVC models remains under-explored. Recent techniques that rely on text-to-image generation or Img2Img methods, such as SDEdit, often struggle to generate images that accurately represent the class while modifying them to a degree that significantly increases the dataset's diversity. To address these challenges, we present SaSPA: Structure and Subject Preserving Augmentation. Contrary to recent methods, our method does not use real images as guidance, thereby increasing generation flexibility and promoting greater diversity. To ensure accurate class representation, we employ conditioning mechanisms, specifically by conditioning on image edges and subject representation.We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark SaSPA against both traditional and generative data augmentation techniques. SaSPA consistently outperforms all established baselines across multiple settings, including full dataset training and contextual bias. Additionally, our results reveal interesting patterns in using synthetic data for FGVC models; for instance, we find a relationship between the amount of real data used and the optimal proportion of synthetic data.

Advancing Open-Set Domain Generalization Using Evidential Bi-Level Hardest Domain Scheduler
In Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG), the model is exposed to both new variations of data appearance (domains) and open-set conditions, where both known and novel categories are present at test time. The challenges of this task arise from the dual need to generalize across diverse domains and accurately quantify category novelty, which is critical for applications in dynamic environments. Recently, meta-learning techniques have demonstrated superior results in OSDG, effectively orchestrating the meta-train and -test tasks by employing varied random categories and predefined domain partition strategies. These approaches prioritize a well-designed training schedule over traditional methods that focus primarily on data augmentation and the enhancement of discriminative feature learning. The prevailing meta-learning models in OSDG typically utilize a predefined sequential domain scheduler to structure data partitions. However, a crucial aspect that remains inadequately explored is the influence brought by strategies of domain schedulers during training. In this paper, we observe that an adaptive domain scheduler benefits more in OSDG compared with prefixed sequential and random domain schedulers. We propose the Evidential Bi-Level Hardest Domain Scheduler (EBiL-HaDS) to achieve an adaptive domain scheduler. This method strategically sequences domains by assessing their reliabilities in utilizing a follower network, trained with confidence scores learned in an evidential manner, regularized by max rebiasing discrepancy, and optimized in a bilevel manner. We verify our approach on three OSDG benchmarks, i.e., PACS, DigitsDG, and OfficeHome. The results show that our method substantially improves OSDG performance and achieves more discriminative embeddings for both the seen and unseen categories, underscoring the advantage of a judicious domain scheduler for the generalizability to unseen domains and unseen categories. The source code will be made publicly available.

Advantage-Aware Policy Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning
Offline reinforcement learning endeavors to leverage offline datasets to craft effective agent policy without online interaction, which imposes proper conservative constraints with the support of behavior policies to tackle the out-of-distribution problem. However, existing works often suffer from the constraint conflict issue when offline datasets are collected from multiple behavior policies, i.e., different behavior policies may exhibit inconsistent actions with distinct returns across the state space. To remedy this issue, recent advantage-weighted methods prioritize samples with high advantage values for agent training while inevitably ignoring the diversity of behavior policy.In this paper, we introduce a novel Advantage-Aware Policy Optimization (A2PO) method to explicitly construct advantage-aware policy constraints for offline learning under mixed-quality datasets.Specifically, A2PO employs a conditional variational auto-encoder to disentangle the action distributions of intertwined behavior policies by modeling the advantage values of all training data as conditional variables.Then the agent can follow such disentangled action distribution constraints to optimize the advantage-aware policy towards high advantage values.Extensive experiments conducted on both the single-quality and mixed-quality datasets of the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that A2PO yields results superior to the counterparts. Our code will be made publicly available.

Adversarial Environment Design via Regret-Guided Diffusion Models
Training agents that are robust to environmental changes remains a significant challenge in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Unsupervised environment design (UED) has recently emerged to address this issue by generating a set of training environments tailored to the agent's capabilities. While prior works demonstrate that UED has the potential to learn a robust policy, their performance is constrained by the capabilities of the environment generation. To this end, we propose a novel UED algorithm, adversarial environment design via regret-guided diffusion models (ADD). The proposed method guides the diffusion-based environment generator with the regret of the agent to produce environments that the agent finds challenging but conducive to further improvement. By exploiting the representation power of diffusion models, ADD can directly generate adversarial environments while maintaining the diversity of training environments, enabling the agent to effectively learn a robust policy. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully generates an instructive curriculum of environments, outperforming UED baselines in zero-shot generalization across novel, out-of-distribution environments.

Adversarially Robust Dense-Sparse Tradeoffs via Heavy-Hitters
In the adversarial streaming model, the input is a sequence of adaptive updates that defines an underlying dataset and the goal is to approximate, collect, or compute some statistic while using space sublinear in the size of the dataset. In 2022, Ben-Eliezer, Eden, and Onak showed a dense-sparse trade-off technique that elegantly combined sparse recovery with known techniques using differential privacy and sketch switching to achieve adversarially robust algorithms for $L_p$ estimation and other algorithms on turnstile streams. However, there has been no progress since, either in terms of achievability or impossibility. In this work, we first give improved algorithms for adversarially robust $L_p$-heavy hitters, utilizing deterministic turnstile heavy-hitter algorithms with better tradeoffs. We then utilize our heavy-hitter algorithm to reduce the problem to estimating the frequency moment of the tail vector. We give a new algorithm for this problem in the classical streaming setting, which achieves additive error and uses space independent in the size of the tail. We then leverage these ingredients to give an improved algorithm for adversarially robust $L_p$ estimation on turnstile streams. We believe that our results serve as an important conceptual breakthrough, demonstrating that there is no inherent barrier at the previous state-of-the-art.

Adversarially Robust Multi-task Representation Learning
We study adversarially robust transfer learning, wherein, given labeled data on multiple (source) tasks, the goal is to train a model with small robust error on a previously unseen (target) task. In particular, we consider a multi-task representation learning (MTRL) setting, i.e., we assume that the source and target tasks admit a simple (linear) predictor on top of a shared representation (e.g., the final hidden layer of a  deep neural network). In this general setting, we provide rates on the excess adversarial (transfer) risk for Lipschitz losses and smooth nonnegative losses.These rates show that learning a representation using adversarial training on diverse tasks  helps protect against inference-time attacks in data-scarce environments. Additionally, we provide similar novel rates for single-task setting.

Adversarial Robust Decision Transformer: Enhancing RvS Robustness via Minimax Returns
Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Learning (RvS) methods, such as the Decision Transformer (DT), achieve strong performance in offline learning tasks by leveraging the powerful Transformer architecture for sequential decision-making. However, in adversarial environments, these methods can be non-robust, since the return is dependent on the strategies of both the decision maker and adversary. Training a probabilistic model conditioned on observed return to predict action can fail to generalize, as the trajectories that achieve a return in the dataset might have done so due to a weak and suboptimal behavior adversary. To address this, we propose a worst-case-aware RvS algorithm, the Adversarial Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT), which learns and conditions the policy on in-sample minimax returns-to-go. ARDT aligns the target return with the worst-case return learned through minimax expectile regression, thereby enhancing robustness against powerful test-time adversaries. In experiments conducted on sequential games with full data coverage, ARDT can generate a maximin (Nash Equilibrium) strategy, the solution with the largest adversarial robustness. In large-scale sequential games and continuous adversarial RL environments with partial data coverage, ARDT demonstrates significantly superior robustness to powerful test-time adversaries and attains higher worst-case returns compared to contemporary DT methods.

Adversarial Schrödinger Bridge Matching
The Schrödinger Bridge (SB) problem offers a powerful framework for combining optimal transport and diffusion models. A promising recent approach to solve the SB problem is the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure, which alternates between Markovian and reciprocal projections of continuous-time stochastic processes. However, the model built by the IMF procedure has a long inference time due to using many steps of numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Discrete-time IMF (D-IMF) procedure in which learning of stochastic processes is replaced by learning just a few transition probabilities in discrete time. Its great advantage is that in practice it can be naturally implemented using the Denoising Diffusion GAN (DD-GAN), an already well-established adversarial generative modeling technique. We show that our D-IMF procedure can provide the same quality of unpaired domain translation as the IMF, using only several generation steps instead of hundreds.

AFBench: A Large-scale Benchmark for Airfoil Design
Data-driven generative models have emerged as promising approaches towards achieving efficient mechanical inverse design. However, due to prohibitively high cost in time and money, there is still lack of open-source and large-scale benchmarks in this field. It is mainly the case for airfoil inverse design, which requires to generate and edit diverse geometric-qualified  and aerodynamic-qualified airfoils following the multimodal instructions, \emph{i.e.,} dragging points and physical parameters. This paper presents the open-source endeavors in airfoil inverse design, \emph{AFBench}, including a large-scale dataset with 200 thousand airfoils and high-quality aerodynamic and geometric labels, two novel and practical airfoil inverse design tasks, \emph{i.e.,} conditional generation on multimodal physical parameters, controllable editing, and comprehensive metrics to evaluate various existing airfoil inverse design methods. Our aim is to establish \emph{AFBench} as an ecosystem for training and evaluating airfoil inverse design methods, with a specific focus on data-driven controllable inverse design models by multimodal instructions capable of bridging the gap between ideas and execution, the academic research and industrial applications. We have provided baseline models, comprehensive experimental observations, and analysis to accelerate future research. Our baseline model is trained on an RTX 3090 GPU within 16 hours. The codebase, datasets and benchmarks will be available at \url{https://hitcslj.github.io/afbench/}.

A Flexible, Equivariant Framework for Subgraph GNNs via Graph Products and Graph Coarsening
Subgraph Graph Neural Networks (Subgraph GNNs) enhance the expressivity of message-passing GNNs by representing graphs as sets of subgraphs. They have shown impressive performance on several tasks, but their complexity limits applications to larger graphs. Previous approaches suggested processing only subsets of subgraphs, selected either randomly or via learnable sampling. However, they make suboptimal subgraph selections or can only cope with very small subset sizes, inevitably incurring performance degradation. This paper introduces a new Subgraph GNNs framework to address these issues.  We employ a graph coarsening function to cluster nodes into super-nodes with induced connectivity. The product between the coarsened and the original graph reveals an implicit structure whereby subgraphs are associated with specific sets of nodes. By running generalized message-passing on such graph product, our method effectively implements an efficient, yet powerful Subgraph GNN. Controlling the coarsening function enables meaningful selection of any number of subgraphs while, contrary to previous methods, being fully compatible with standard training techniques. Notably, we discover that the resulting node feature tensor exhibits new, unexplored permutation symmetries. We leverage this structure, characterize the associated linear equivariant layers and incorporate them into the layers of our Subgraph GNN architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple graph learning benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more flexible than previous approaches, as it can seamlessly handle any number of subgraphs, while consistently outperforming baseline approaches.

A Functional Extension of Semi-Structured Networks
Semi-structured networks (SSNs) merge the structures familiar from additive models with deep neural networks, allowing the modeling of interpretable partial feature effects while capturing higher-order non-linearities at the same time. A significant challenge in this integration is maintaining the interpretability of the additive model component. Inspired by large-scale biomechanics datasets, this paper explores extending SSNs to functional data. Existing methods in functional data analysis are promising but often not expressive enough to account for all interactions and non-linearities and do not scale well to large datasets. Although the SSN approach presents a compelling potential solution, its adaptation to functional data remains complex. In this work, we propose a functional SSN method that retains the advantageous properties of classical functional regression approaches while also improving scalability. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach accurately recovers underlying signals, enhances predictive performance, and performs favorably compared to competing methods.

A generalized neural tangent kernel for surrogate gradient learning
State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation.The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.

A General Protocol to Probe Large Vision Models for 3D Physical Understanding
Our objective in this paper is to probe large vision models to determine to what extent they `understand' different physical properties of the 3D scene depicted in an image. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We introduce a general and lightweight protocol to evaluate whether features of an off-the-shelf large vision model encode a number of physical 'properties' of the 3D scene, by training discriminative classifiers on the features for these properties. The probes are applied on datasets of real images with annotations for the property. (ii) We apply this protocol to properties covering scene geometry, scene material, support relations, lighting, and view-dependent measures, and large vision models including CLIP, DINOv1, DINOv2, VQGAN, Stable Diffusion. (iii) We find that features from Stable Diffusion and DINOv2 are good for discriminative learning of a number of properties, including scene geometry, support relations, shadows and depth, but less performant for occlusion and material, while outperforming DINOv1, CLIP and VQGAN for all properties. (iv) It is observed that different time steps of Stable Diffusion features, as well as different transformer layers of DINO/CLIP/VQGAN, are good at different properties, unlocking potential applications of 3D physical understanding.

A Generative Approach to Control Complex Physical Systems
Controlling the evolution of complex physical systems is a fundamental task across science and engineering. Classical techniques suffer from limited applicability or huge computational costs. On the other hand, recent deep learning and reinforcement learning-based approaches often struggle to optimize long-term control sequences under the constraints of system dynamics. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Physical systems Control (DiffPhyCon), a new class of method to address the physical systems control problem. DiffPhyCon excels by simultaneously minimizing both the learned generative energy function and the predefined control objectives across the entire trajectory and control sequence. Thus, it can explore globally and identify near-optimal control sequences. Moreover, we enhance DiffPhyCon with prior reweighting, enabling the discovery of control sequences that significantly deviate from the training distribution. We test our method in 1D Burgers' equation and 2D jellyfish movement control in a fluid environment. Our method outperforms widely applied classical approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning and reinforcement learning methods. Notably, DiffPhyCon unveils an intriguing fast-close-slow-open pattern observed in the jellyfish, aligning with established findings in the field of fluid dynamics.

A Generative Model of Symmetry Transformations
Correctly capturing the symmetry transformations of data can lead to efficient models with strong generalization capabilities, though methods incorporating symmetries often require prior knowledge.While recent advancements have been made in learning those symmetries directly from the dataset, most of this work has focused on the discriminative setting.In this paper, we take inspiration from group theoretic ideas to construct a generative model that explicitly aims to capture the data's approximate symmetries. This results in a model that, given a prespecified broad set of possible symmetries, learns to what extent, if at all, those symmetries are actually present.Our model can be seen as a generative process for data augmentation.We provide a simple algorithm for learning our generative model and empirically demonstrate its ability to capture symmetries under affine and color transformations, in an interpretable way.Combining our symmetry model with standard generative models results in higher marginal test-log-likelihoods and improved data efficiency.

AgentGym: A Dynamic Environment to Evaluate Attacks and Defenses for LLM Agents
AI agents aim to solve complex tasks by combining text-based reasoning with external tool calls.Unfortunately, AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks where data returned by external tools hijacks the agent to execute malicious tasks.To measure the adversarial robustness of AI agents, we introduce AgentGym, an evaluation framework for agents that execute tools over untrusted data.To capture the evolving nature of attacks and defenses, AgentGym is not a static test suite, but rather an extensible environment for designing and evaluating new agent tasks, defenses, and adaptive attacks.We populate the environment with 97 realistic tasks (e.g., managing an email client, navigating an e-banking website, or making travel bookings), 629 security test cases, and various attack and defense paradigms from the literature.We find that AgentGym poses a challenge for both attacks and defenses: state-of-the-art LLMs fail at many tasks (even in the absence of attacks), and existing prompt injection attacks break some security properties but not all. We hope that AgentGym can foster research on new design principles for AI agents that solve common tasks in a reliable and robust manner.

A Geometric View of Data Complexity: Efficient Local Intrinsic Dimension Estimation with Diffusion Models
High-dimensional data commonly lies on low-dimensional submanifolds, and estimating the local intrinsic dimension (LID) of a datum -- i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to -- is a longstanding problem. LID can be understood as the number of local factors of variation: the more factors of variation a datum has, the more complex it tends to be. Estimating this quantity has proven useful in contexts ranging from generalization in neural networks to detection of out-of-distribution data, adversarial examples, and AI-generated text. The recent successes of deep generative models present an opportunity to leverage them for LID estimation, but current methods based on generative models produce inaccurate estimates, require more than a single pre-trained model, are computationally intensive, or do not exploit the best available deep generative models, i.e. diffusion models (DMs). In this work, we show that the Fokker-Planck equation associated with a DM can provide a LID estimator which addresses all the aforementioned deficiencies. Our estimator, called FLIPD, is compatible with all popular DMs, and outperforms existing baselines on LID estimation benchmarks. We also apply FLIPD on natural images where the true LID is unknown. Compared to competing estimators, FLIPD exhibits higher correlation with non-LID measures of complexity, better matches a qualitative assessment of complexity, and is the only estimator to remain tractable with high-resolution images at the scale of Stable Diffusion.

A Global Depth-Range-Free Multi-View Stereo Transformer Network with Pose Embedding
In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view stereo (MVS) framework that gets rid of the depth range prior. Unlike recent prior-free MVS methods that work in a pair-wise manner,  our method simultaneously considers all the source images.  Specifically, we introduce a Multi-view Disparity Attention (MDA) module to aggregate long-range context information within and across multi-view images.   Considering the asymmetry of the epipolar disparity flow, the key to our method lies in accurately modeling multi-view motion constraints.   We integrate pose embedding to encapsulate information such as multi-view camera poses, providing implicit motion constraints for multi-view motion feature fusion dominated by attention.   Additionally, due to significant differences in the observation quality of the same pixel in the reference frame across multiple source frames, we construct corresponding hidden states for each source image.   We explicitly estimate the quality of the current pixel corresponding to sampled points on the epipolar line of the source image and dynamically update hidden states through the uncertainty estimation module.   Extensive results on the DTU dataset and Tanks\&Temple benchmark demonstrate   the effectiveness of our method.

A Gradient Accumulation Method for Dense Retriever under Memory Constraint
InfoNCE loss is commonly used to train dense retriever in information retrieval tasks. It is well known that a large batch is essential to stable and effective training with InfoNCE loss, which requires significant hardware resources. Due to the dependency of large batch, dense retriever has bottleneck of application and research. Recently, memory reduction methods have been broadly adopted to resolve the hardware bottleneck by decomposing forward and backward or using a memory bank. However, current methods still suffer from slow and unstable train. To address these issues, we propose Contrastive Accumulation (ContAccum), a stable and efficient memory reduction method for dense retriever trains that uses a dual memory bank structure to leverage previously generated query and passage representations. Experiments on widely used five information retrieval datasets indicate that ContAccum can surpass not only existing memory reduction methods but also high-resource scenarios. Moreover, theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm that ContAccum provides more stable dual-encoder training than current memory bank utilization methods.

A hierarchical decomposition for explaining ML performance discrepancies
Machine learning (ML) algorithms can often differ in performance across domains. Understanding why their performance differs is crucial for determining what types of interventions (e.g., algorithmic or operational) are most effective at closing the performance gaps. Aggregate decompositions express the total performance gap as the gap due to a shift in the feature distribution $p(X)$ plus the gap due to a shift in the outcome's conditional  distribution $p(Y|X)$. While this coarse explanation is helpful for guiding root cause analyses, it provides limited details and can only suggest coarse fixes involving all variables in an ML system. Detailed decompositions quantify the importance of each variable to each term in the aggregate decomposition, which can provide a deeper understanding and suggest more targeted interventions. Although parametric methods exist for conducting a full hierarchical decomposition of an algorithm's performance gap at the aggregate and detailed levels, current nonparametric methods only cover parts of the hierarchy; many also require knowledge of the entire causal graph. We introduce a nonparametric hierarchical framework for explaining why the performance of an ML algorithm differs across domains, without requiring causal knowledge. Furthermore, we derive debiased, computationally-efficient estimators and statistical inference procedures to construct confidence intervals for the explanations.

A Huber Loss Minimization Approach to Mean Estimation under User-level Differential Privacy
Privacy protection of users' entire contribution of samples is important in distributed systems. The most effective approach is the two-stage scheme, which finds a small interval first and then gets a refined estimate by clipping samples into the interval. However, the clipping operation induces bias, which is serious if the sample distribution is heavy-tailed. Besides, users with large local sample sizes can make the sensitivity much larger, thus the method is not suitable for imbalanced users. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a Huber loss minimization approach to mean estimation under user-level differential privacy. The connecting points of Huber loss can be adaptively adjusted to deal with imbalanced users. Moreover, it avoids the clipping operation, thus significantly reducing the bias compared with the two-stage approach. We provide a theoretical analysis of our approach, which gives the noise strength needed for privacy protection, as well as the bound of mean squared error. The result shows that the new method is much less sensitive to the imbalance of user-wise sample sizes and the tail of sample distributions. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to validate our theoretical analysis.

AID: Attention Interpolation of Text-to-Image Diffusion
Conditional diffusion models can create unseen images in various settings, aiding image interpolation. Interpolation in latent spaces is well-studied, but interpolation with specific conditions like text or pose is less understood. Common and simple approaches use linear interpolation in the conditioning space but tend to result in inconsistent images with poor fidelity. This work introduces a novel training-free technique named \textbf{Attention Interpolation via Diffusion (AID)}. AID has two key contributions: \textbf{1)} a fused inner/outer interpolated attention layer to boost image consistency and fidelity; and \textbf{2)} selection of interpolation coefficients via a beta distribution to increase smoothness. Additionally, we present an AID variant called \textbf{Prompt-guided Attention Interpolation via Diffusion (PAID)}, which \textbf{3)} treats interpolation as a condition-dependent generative process. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves greater consistency, smoothness, and efficiency in condition-based interpolation, aligning closely with human preferences. Furthermore, PAID can significantly benefit compositional generation and image editing control, all while remaining training-free.

AirSketch: Generative Motion to Sketch
Illustration is a fundamental mode of human expression and communication. Certain types of motion that accompany speech can provide this illustrative mode of communication. While Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies (AR/VR) have introduced tools for producing drawings with hand motions (air drawing), they typically require costly hardware and additional digital markers, thereby limiting their accessibility and portability. Furthermore, air drawing demands considerable skill to achieve aesthetic results. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of AirSketch, aimed at generating faithful and visually coherent sketches directly from hand motions, eliminating the need for complicated headsets or markers. We devise a simple augmentation-based self-supervised training procedure, enabling a controllable image diffusion model to learn to translate from highly noisy hand tracking images to clean, aesthetically pleasing sketches, while preserving the essential visual cues from the original tracking data. We present two air drawing datasets to study this problem. Our findings demonstrate that beyond producing photo-realistic images from precise spatial inputs, controllable image diffusion can effectively produce a refined, clear sketch from a noisy input. Our work serves as an initial step towards marker-less air drawing and reveals distinct applications of controllable diffusion models to AirSketch and AR/VR in general.

A Kernel Perspective on Distillation-based Collaborative Learning
In response to various situational demands, there is a growing interest in methodologies for enhancing AI models of multiple parties through collaboration.However, it is still challenging to achieve sufficient performance enhancement without sharing private data and models owned by individual parties.One recent promising approach is to develop distillation-based algorithms that exploit unlabeled public data but the results are still unsatisfactory in both theory and practice.To tackle this problem, we rigorously analyze a representative distillation-based algorithm in the view of kernel regression.This work provides the first theoretical results to prove the (nearly) minimax optimality of the privacy-preserving nonparametric collaborative learning algorithm in massively distributed statistically heterogeneous environments.Inspired by our theoretical results, we also propose a practical distillation-based collaborative learning algorithm based on neural network architecture.Our algorithm successfully bridges the gap between our theoretical assumptions and practical settings with neural networks through feature kernel matching.We simulate various regression tasks to verify our theory and demonstrate the practical feasibility of our proposed algorithm.

A Label is Worth A Thousand Images in Dataset Distillation
Data *quality* is a crucial factor in machine learning model performance, a principle that has been exploited by dataset distillation methods to compress training datasets into much smaller counterparts with similar downstream performance. Understanding how and why data distillation methods work is vital not only to improve these methods but also to reveal fundamental characteristics of "good" training data. However, a major challenge to this goal is the observation that distillation approaches have little in common with each other, relying on sophisticated but mostly disparate methods to generate synthetic data. In this work, we highlight a largely overlooked aspect that is nevertheless common to most of these methods: the use of soft (probabilistic) labels, whose role in distillation we study in depth through a series of ablation experiments. Our results show that, surprisingly, the main factor explaining the performance of state-of-the-art distillation methods is not the specific techniques used to generate synthetic data, but rather the use of soft labels.  Second, we show that not all soft labels are created equal, i.e., they must contain *structured information* to be beneficial. Finally, we provide empirical scaling laws that characterize the effectiveness of soft labels as a function of images-per-class in the distilled dataset, and establish an empirical Pareto frontier for data-efficient learning. Combined, our findings challenge conventional wisdom in dataset distillation, underscore the importance of soft labels in learning, and suggest new directions for improving distillation methods.

Algebraic Positional Encodings
We introduce a novel positional encoding strategy for Transformer-style models, addressing the shortcomings of existing, often ad hoc, approaches. Our framework provides a flexible mapping from the algebraic specification of a domain to an interpretation as orthogonal operators. This design preserves the algebraic characteristics of the source domain, ensuring that the model upholds the desired structural properties. Our scheme can accommodate various structures, including sequences, grids and trees, as well as their compositions. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach. Results suggest performance on par with or surpassing the current state-of-the-art, without hyperparameter optimizations or ``task search'' of any kind. Code is made available for review.

Algorithmic Capabilities of Random Transformers
Trained transformer models have been found to implement interpretable procedures for tasks like arithmetic and associative recall, but little is understood about how the circuits that implement these procedures originate during training. To what extent do they depend on the supervisory signal provided to models, and to what extent are they attributable to behavior already present in models at the beginning of training? To investigate these questions, we investigate what functions can be learned by randomly initialized transformers in which only the embedding layers are optimized, so that the only input--output mappings learnable from data are those already implemented (up to a choice of encoding scheme) by the randomly initialized model. We find that these random transformers can perform a wide range of meaningful algorithmic tasks, including modular arithmetic, in-weights and in-context associative recall, decimal addition, parenthesis balancing, and even some aspects of natural language text generation. Our results indicate that some algorithmic capabilities are present in transformers (and accessible via appropriately structured inputs) even before these models are trained.

Algorithmic Collective Action in Recommender Systems: Promoting Songs by Reordering Playlists
We investigate algorithmic collective action in transformer-based recommender systems. Our use case is a collective of fans aiming to promote the visibility of an artist by strategically placing one of their songs in the existing playlists they control. The success of the collective is measured by the increase in test-time recommendations of the targeted song, given a constraint on the impact on user experience. We introduce two easy-to-implement strategies towards this goal and test their efficacy on a publicly available recommender system model used in production by a major music streaming platform. Our findings reveal that even small collectives (controlling less than 0.01\% of the training data) can achieve up to $25\times$ amplification of recommendations by strategically choosing the position at which to insert the song. We then focus on investigating the externalities of the strategy. We find that the recommendations of other songs are largely preserved, and the performance loss for the platform is negligible. Moreover, the newly gained recommendations are evenly distributed among other artists. Taken together, our findings demonstrate how collective action strategies that are designed to preserve user experience can be effective while not necessarily being adversarial, outlining an important distinction between collective action and data poisoning.

Algorithmic progress in language models
We investigate the rate at which algorithms for pre-training language models have improved since the advent of deep learning. Using a dataset of over 200 language model evaluations on Wikitext and Penn Treebank spanning 2012-2023, we find that the compute required to reach a set performance threshold has halved approximately every 8 months, with a 95\% confidence interval of around 5 to 14 months, substantially faster than hardware gains per Moore's Law. We estimate augmented scaling laws, which enable us to quantify algorithmic progress and determine the relative contributions of scaling models versus innovations in training algorithms. Despite the rapid pace of algorithmic progress and the development of new architectures such as the transformer, our analysis reveals that the increase in compute made an even larger contribution to overall performance improvements over this time period. Though limited by noisy benchmark data, our analysis quantifies the rapid progress in language modeling, shedding light on the relative contributions from compute and algorithms.

Alias-Free Mamba Neural Operator
Benefiting from the booming deep learning techniques, neural operators (NO) are considered as an ideal alternative to break the traditions of solving Partial Differential Equations (PDE) with expensive cost.Yet with the remarkable progress, current solutions concern little on the holistic function features--both global and local information-- during the process of solving PDEs.Besides, a meticulously designed kernel integration to meet desirable performance often suffers from a severe computational burden, such as GNO with $O(N(N-1))$, FNO with $O(NlogN)$, and Transformer-based NO with $O(N^2)$.To counteract the dilemma, we propose a mamba neural operator with $O(N)$ computational complexity, namely MambaNO.Functionally, MambaNO achieves a clever balance between global integration, facilitated by state space model of Mamba that scans the entire function, and local integration, engaged with an alias-free architecture. We prove a property of continuous-discrete equivalence to show the capability ofMambaNO in approximating operators arising from universal PDEs to desired accuracy. MambaNOs are evaluated on a diverse set of benchmarks with possibly multi-scale solutions and set new state-of-the-art scores, yet with fewer parameters and better efficiency.

Aligning Diffusion Models by Optimizing Human Utility
We present Diffusion-KTO, a novel approach for aligning text-to-image diffusion models by formulating the alignment objective as the maximization of expected human utility. Unlike previous methods, Diffusion-KTO does not require collecting pairwise preference data nor training a complex reward model. Instead, our objective uses per-image binary feedback signals, e.g. likes or dislikes, to align the model with human preferences. After fine-tuning using Diffusion-KTO, text-to-image diffusion models exhibit improved performance compared to existing techniques, including supervised fine-tuning and Diffusion-DPO, both in terms of human judgment and automatic evaluation metrics such as PickScore and ImageReward. Overall, Diffusion-KTO unlocks the potential of leveraging readily available per-image binary preference signals and broadens the applicability of aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences.

Aligning Individual and Collective Objectives in Multi-Agent Cooperation
Among the research topics in multi-agent learning, mixed-motive cooperation is one of the most prominent challenges, primarily due to the mismatch between individual and collective goals. The cutting-edge research is focused on incorporating domain knowledge into rewards and introducing additional mechanisms to incentivize cooperation. However, these approaches often face shortcomings such as the effort on manual design and the absence of theoretical groundings. To close this gap, we model the mixed-motive game as a differentiable game for the ease of illuminating the learning dynamics towards cooperation. More detailed, we introduce a novel optimization method named \textbf{\textit{A}}ltruistic \textbf{\textit{G}}radient \textbf{\textit{A}}djustment (\textbf{\textit{AgA}}) that employs gradient adjustments to progressively align individual and collective objectives. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that AgA effectively attracts gradients to stable fixed points of the collective objective while considering individual interests, and we validate these claims with empirical evidence. We evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm AgA through benchmark environments for testing mixed-motive collaboration with small-scale agents such as the two-player public good game and the sequential social dilemma games, Cleanup and Harvest, as well as our self-developed large-scale environment in the game StarCraft II.

Aligning Model Properties via Conformal Risk Control
AI model alignment is crucial due to inadvertent biases in training data and the underspecified pipeline in modern machine learning, where numerous models with excellent test set metrics can be produced, yet they may not meet end-user requirements. Recent advances demonstrate that post-training model alignment via human feedback can address some of these challenges. However, these methods are often confined to settings (such as generative AI) where humans can interpret model outputs and provide feedback. In traditional non-generative settings, where model outputs are numerical values or classes, detecting misalignment through single-sample outputs is highly challenging. In this paper we consider an alternative strategy. We propose interpreting model alignment through property testing, defining an aligned model $f$ as one belonging to a subset $\mathcal{P}$ of functions that exhibit specific desired behaviors. We focus on post-processing a pre-trained model $f$ to better align with $\mathcal{P}$ using conformal risk control. Specifically, we develop a general procedure for converting queries for a given property $\mathcal{P}$ to a collection of loss functions suitable for use in a conformal risk control algorithm. We prove a probabilistic guarantee that the resulting conformal interval around $f$  contains a function approximately satisfying $\mathcal{P}$. We exhibit applications of our methodology on a collection of supervised learning datasets for (shape-constrained) properties such as monotonicity and concavity. The general procedure is flexible and can be applied to a wide range of desired properties.

Aligning Vision Models with Human Aesthetics in Retrieval: Benchmarks and Algorithms
Modern vision models are trained on very large noisy datasets. While these models acquire strong capabilities, they may not follow the user's intent to output the desired results in certain aspects, e.g., visual aesthetic, preferred style, and responsibility. In this paper, we target the realm of visual aesthetics and aim to align vision models with human aesthetic standards in a retrieval system. Advanced retrieval systems usually adopt a cascade of aesthetic models as re-rankers or filters, which are limited to low-level features like saturation and perform poorly when stylistic, cultural or knowledge contexts are involved. We find that utilizing the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) to rephrase the search query and extend the aesthetic expectations can make up for this shortcoming. Based on the above findings, we propose a preference-based reinforcement learning method that fine-tunes the vision models to distill the knowledge from both LLMs reasoning and the aesthetic models to better align the vision models with human aesthetics. Meanwhile, with rare benchmarks designed for evaluating retrieval systems, we leverage large multi-modality model (LMM) to evaluate the aesthetic performance with their strong abilities. As aesthetic assessment is one of the most subjective tasks, to validate the robustness of LMM, we further propose a novel dataset named HPIR to benchmark the alignment with human aesthetics.  Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the aesthetic behaviors of the vision models, under several metrics. We believe the proposed algorithm can be a general practice for aligning vision models with human values.

Alleviate Anchor-Shift: Explore Blind Spots with Cross-View Reconstruction for Incomplete Multi-View Clustering
Incomplete multi-view clustering aims to learn complete correlations among samples by leveraging complementary information across multiple views for clustering. Anchor-based methods further establish sample-level similarities for representative anchor generation, effectively addressing scalability issues in large-scale scenarios. Despite efficiency improvements, existing methods overlook the misguidance in anchors learning induced by partial missing samples, i.e., the absence of samples results in shift of learned anchors, further leading to sub-optimal clustering performance. To conquer the challenges, our solution involves a cross-view reconstruction strategy that not only alleviate the anchor shift problem through a carefully designed cross-view learning process, but also reconstructs missing samples in a way that transcends the limitations imposed by convex combinations. By employing affine combinations, our method explores areas beyond the convex hull defined by anchors, thereby illuminating blind spots in the reconstruction of missing samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets and three large-scale datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Alleviating Distortion in Image Generation via Multi-Resolution Diffusion Models
This paper presents innovative enhancements to diffusion models by integrating a novel multi-resolution network and time-dependent layer normalization. Diffusion models have gained prominence for their effectiveness in high-fidelity image generation. While conventional approaches rely on convolutional U-Net architectures, recent Transformer-based designs have demonstrated superior performance and scalability. However, Transformer architectures, which tokenize input data (via "patchification"), face a trade-off between visual fidelity and computational complexity due to the quadratic nature of self-attention operations concerning token length. While larger patch sizes enable attention computation efficiency, they struggle to capture fine-grained visual details, leading to image distortions. To address this challenge, we propose augmenting the **Di**ffusion model with the **M**ulti-**R**esolution network (DiMR), a framework that refines features across multiple resolutions, progressively enhancing detail from low to high resolution. Additionally, we introduce Time-Dependent Layer Normalization (TD-LN), a parameter-efficient approach that incorporates time-dependent parameters into layer normalization to inject time information and achieve superior performance. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated on the class-conditional ImageNet generation benchmark, where DiMR-XL variants outperform prior diffusion models, setting new state-of-the-art FID scores of 1.70 on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.89 on ImageNet $512\times512$.

All-in-One Image Coding for Joint Human-Machine Vision with Multi-Path Aggregation
Image coding for multi-task applications, catering to both human perception and machine vision, has been extensively investigated. Existing methods often rely on multiple task-specific encoder-decoder pairs, leading to high overhead of parameter and bitrate usage, or face challenges in multi-objective optimization under a unified representation, failing to achieve both performance and efficiency. To this end, we propose Multi-Path Aggregation (MPA) integrated into existing coding models for joint human-machine vision, unifying the feature representation with an all-in-one architecture. MPA employs a predictor to allocate latent features among task-specific paths based on feature importance varied across tasks, maximizing the utility of shared features while best preserving task-specific features for subsequent refinement. Leveraging feature correlations, we develop a two-stage optimization strategy to alleviate multi-task performance degradation. Upon the reuse of shared features, as low as 1.89\% parameters are further augmented and fine-tuned for a specific task, which completely avoids extensive optimization of the entire model. Experimental results show that MPA achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in both task-specific and multi-objective optimization across human viewing and machine analysis tasks. Moreover, our all-in-one design supports seamless transitions between human- and machine-oriented reconstruction, enabling task-controllable interpretation without altering the unified model.

Almost Surely Asymptotically Constant Graph Neural Networks
We present a new angle on the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by studying how the predictions of a GNN probabilistic classifier evolve as we apply it on larger graphs drawn from some random graph model. We show that the output converges to a constant function, which upper-bounds what these classifiers can uniformly express. This strong convergence phenomenon applies to a very wide class of GNNs, including state of the art models, with aggregates including mean and the attention-based mechanism of graph transformers. Our results apply to a broad class of random graph models, including the (sparse) Erdős–Rényi model, the stochastic block model, and the Barabási-Albert model. We empirically validate these findings, observing that the convergence phenomenon appears not only on random graphs but also on some real-world graphs of modest size.

A Locally Optimal Portfolio for m-Sparse Sharpe Ratio Maximization
The Sharpe ratio is an important and widely-used risk-adjusted return in financial engineering. In modern portfolio management, one may require an $m$-sparse (no more than $m$ active assets) portfolio to save managerial and financial costs. However, few existing methods can optimize the Sharpe ratio with the $m$-sparse constraint, due to the nonconvexity and the complexity of this constraint. We propose to transform the $m$-sparse fractional optimization problem into an equivalent m-sparse quadratic programming problem. The semi-algebraic property of the resulting objective function allows us to exploit the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property to develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm that converges to a portfolio which achieves the locally optimal $m$-sparse Sharpe ratio. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal that achieves a locally optimal $m$-sparse Sharpe ratio with a theoretically-sound guarantee.

A Local Method for Satisfying Interventional Fairness with Partially Known Causal Graphs
Developing fair automated machine learning algorithms is critical in making safe and trustworthy decisions. Many causality-based fairness notions have been proposed to address the above issues by quantifying the causal connections between sensitive attributes and decisions, and when the true causal graph is fully known, certain algorithms that achieve interventional fairness have been proposed. However, when the true causal graph is unknown, it is still challenging to effectively and well exploit partially directed acyclic graphs (PDAGs) to achieve interventional fairness. To exploit the PDAGs for achieving interventional fairness, previous methods have been built on variable selection or causal effect identification, but limited to reduced prediction accuracy or strong assumption for identification. In this paper, we propose a general min-max optimization framework that can effectively achieve interventional fairness with promising prediction accuracy and can be extended to maximally oriented PDAGs (MPDAGs) with added background knowledge. Specifically, we first estimate all possible treatment effects of sensitive attributes on a given prediction model from all possible adjustment sets of sensitive attributes. Next, we propose to alternatively update the prediction model and the possible estimated causal effects, where the prediction model is trained via a min-max loss to control the worst-case fairness violations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our methods.

ALOHA: from Attention to Likes – a unified mOdel for understanding HumAn responses to diverse visual content
Progress in human behavior modeling involves understanding both implicit, early-stage perceptual behavior such as human attention and explicit, later-stage behavior such as subjective ratings/likes/preferences. Yet, most prior research has focused on modeling implicit and explicit human behavior in isolation; and often limited to a specific type of visual content. Can we build a unified model of human attention and preference behavior that reliably works across diverse types of visual content? Such a model would enable predicting subjective feedback such as overall satisfaction or aesthetic quality ratings, along with the underlying human attention or interaction heatmaps and viewing order, enabling designers and content-creation models to optimize their creation for human-centric improvements. In this paper, we propose ALOHA -- a unified model for understanding human responses from attention to likes, across diverse visual content. ALOHA leverages a multimodal transformer, featuring distinct prediction heads for each facet, and predicts human responses such as attention heatmaps, scanpath or viewing order, as well as subjective rating/preference. We train ALOHA on diverse public datasets spanning natural images, web pages and graphic designs, and achieve SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks across different image domains and various behavior modeling tasks. Potential applications include providing instant feedback on the effectiveness of UIs/digital designs/images, and serving as a reward model to further optimize design/visual-content creation.

AlterMOMA: Fusion Redundancy Pruning for Camera-LiDAR Fusion Models with Alternative Modality Masking
Camera-LiDAR fusion models significantly enhance perception performance in autonomous driving. The fusion mechanism leverages the strengths of each modality while minimizing their weaknesses. Moreover, in practice, camera-LiDAR fusion models utilize pre-trained backbones for efficient training. However, we argue that directly loading single-modal pre-trained camera and LiDAR backbones into camera-LiDAR fusion models introduces similar feature redundancy across modalities due to the nature of the fusion mechanism. Unfortunately, existing pruning methods are developed explicitly for single-modal models, and thus, they struggle to effectively identify these specific redundant parameters in camera-LiDAR fusion models. In this paper, to address the issue above on camera-LiDAR fusion models, we propose a novelty pruning framework Alternative Modality Masking Pruning (AlterMOMA), which employs alternative masking on each modality and identifies the redundant parameters. Specifically, when one modality parameters are masked (deactivated), the absence of features from the masked backbone compels the model to reactivate previous redundant features of the other modality backbone. Therefore, these redundant features and relevant redundant parameters can be identified via the reactivation process. The redundant parameters can be pruned by our proposed importance score evaluation function, Alternative Evaluation (AlterEva), which is based on the observation of the loss changes when certain modality parameters are activated and deactivated. Extensive experiments on the nuScene and KITTI datasets encompassing diverse tasks, baseline models, and pruning algorithms showcase that AlterMOMA outperforms existing pruning methods, attaining state-of-the-art performance.

A Metalearned Neural Circuit for Nonparametric Bayesian Inference
Most applications of machine learning to classification assume a closed set of balanced classes. This is at odds with the real world, where class occurrence statistics often follow a long-tailed power-law distribution and it is unlikely that all classes are seen in a single sample. Nonparametric Bayesian models naturally capture this phenomenon, but have significant practical barriers to widespread adoption, namely implementation complexity and computational inefficiency. To address this, we present a method for extracting the inductive bias from a nonparametric Bayesian model and transferring it to an artificial neural network. By simulating data with a nonparametric Bayesian prior, we can metalearn a sequence model that performs inference over an unlimited set of classes. After training, this "neural circuit" has distilled the corresponding inductive bias and can successfully perform sequential inference over an open set of classes. Our experimental results show that the metalearned neural circuit achieves comparable or better performance than particle filter-based methods for inference in these models while being faster and simpler to use than methods that explicitly incorporate Bayesian nonparametric inference.

A Modular Conditional Diffusion Framework for Image Reconstruction
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have been recently utilized to deal with various blind image restoration (IR) tasks, where they have demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of perceptual quality. However, the task-specific nature of existing solutions and the excessive computational costs related to their training, make such models impractical and challenging to use for different IR tasks than those that were initially trained for. This hinders their wider adoption especially by those who lack access to powerful computational resources and vast amounts of training data. In this work we aim to address the above issues and enable the successful adoption of DPMs in practical IR-related applications. Towards this goal, we propose a modular diffusion probabilistic IR framework (DP-IR), which allows us to combine the performance benefits of existing pre-trained state-of-the-art IR networks and generative DPMs, while it requires only the additional training of a small module (0.7M params) related to the particular IR task of interest. Moreover, the architecture of our proposed framework allows us to employ a sampling strategy that leads to at least four times reduction of neural function evaluations without any performance loss, while it can also be combined with existing acceleration techniques (e.g. DDIM). We evaluate our model on four benchmarks for the tasks of burst JDD-SR, dynamic scene deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of perceptual quality while retaining a competitive performance in relation to fidelity metrics.

Amortized Bayesian Experimental Design for Decision-Making
Many critical decisions, such as personalized medical diagnoses and product pricing, are made based on insights gained from designing, observing, and analyzing a series of experiments. This highlights the crucial role of experimental design, which goes beyond merely collecting information on system parameters as in traditional Bayesian experimental design (BED), but also plays a key part in facilitating downstream decision-making. Most recent BED methods use amortized inference with a policy network to rapidly design experiments. However, the information gathered through these methods is suboptimal for down-the-line decision-making, as the experiments are not inherently designed with downstream objectives in mind. In this paper, we present an amortized decision-aware BED framework that prioritizes maximizing downstream decision utility. We introduce a novel architecture, the Transformer Neural Decision Process (TNDP), capable of instantly proposing the next experimental design, whilst inferring the downstream decision, thus effectively amortizing both tasks within a unified workflow. We demonstrate the performance of our method across several tasks, showing that it can deliver informative designs and facilitate accurate decision-making.

Amortized Eigendecomposition for Neural Networks
Performing eigendecomposition during neural network training is essential for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, network compression, image denoising, and graph learning. However, eigendecomposition is computationally expensive as it is orders of magnitude slower than other neural network operations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called "amortized eigendecomposition" that relaxes the exact eigendecomposition by introducing an additional loss term called eigen loss. Our approach offers significant speed improvements by replacing the computationally expensive eigendecomposition with a more affordable QR decomposition at each iteration. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the desired eigenpair is attained as optima of the eigen loss. Empirical studies on nuclear norm regularization, latent-space principal component analysis, and graphs adversarial learning demonstrate significant improvements in training efficiency while producing nearly identical outcomes to conventional approaches. This novel methodology promises to integrate eigendecomposition efficiently into neural network training, overcoming existing computational challenges and unlocking new potential for advanced deep learning applications.

Amortized Planning with Large-Scale Transformers: A Case Study on Chess
This paper uses chess, a landmark planning problem in AI, to assess transformers' performance on a planning task where memorization is futile – even at large scale. To this end, we release ChessBench, a large-scale benchmark dataset of 10 million chess games with legal move and value annotations (15 billion data points) provided by Stockfish 16, the state-of-the-art chess engine. We train transformers with up to 270 million parameters on ChessBench via supervised learning and perform extensive ablations to assess the impact of dataset size, model size, architecture type, and different prediction targets (state-values, action-values, and behavioral cloning). Our largest models learn to predict action-values for novel boards quite accurately, implying highly non-trivial generalization. Despite performing no explicit search, our resulting chess policy solves challenging chess puzzles and achieves a surprisingly strong Lichess blitz Elo of 2895 against humans (grandmaster-level). We also compare to Leela Chess Zero and AlphaZero (trained without supervision via self-play) with and without search. We show that, although a remarkably good approximation of Stockfish's search-based algorithm can be distilled into large-scale transformers via supervised learning, perfect distillation is still beyond reach, thus making ChessBench well-suited for future research.

An Accelerated Algorithm for Stochastic Bilevel Optimization under Unbounded Smoothness
This paper investigates a class of stochastic bilevel optimization problems where the upper-level function is nonconvex with potentially unbounded smoothness and the lower-level problem is strongly convex. These problems have significant applications in sequential data learning, such as text classification using recurrent neural networks. The unbounded smoothness is characterized by the smoothness constant of the upper-level function scaling linearly with the gradient norm, lacking a uniform upper bound. Existing state-of-the-art algorithms require $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ oracle calls of stochastic gradient or Hessian/Jacobian-vector product to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point. However, it remains unclear if we can further improve the convergence rate when the assumptions for the function in the population level also hold for each random realization almost surely (e.g., Lipschitzness of each realization of the stochastic gradient).  To address this issue, we propose a new Accelerated Bilevel Optimization algorithm named AccBO. The algorithm updates the upper-level variable by normalized stochastic gradient descent with recursive momentum and the lower-level variable by the stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm with averaging. We prove that our algorithm achieves an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^3)$ to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Our proof relies on a novel lemma characterizing the dynamics of stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm under distribution drift with high probability for the lower-level variable, which is of independent interest and also plays a crucial role in analyzing the hypergradient estimation error over time. Experimental results on various tasks confirm that our proposed algorithm achieves the predicted theoretical acceleration and significantly outperforms baselines in bilevel optimization.

Analysing CLIP's Zero-Shot Image Classification via Mutual Knowledge
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) performs zero-shot image classification by mapping images and textual class representation into a shared embedding space, then retrieving the class closest to the image. This work provides a new approach for interpreting CLIP models for image classification from the lens of mutual knowledge between the two modalities. Specifically, we ask: what concepts do both vision and language CLIP encoders learn in common that influence the joint embedding space, causing points to be closer or further apart? We answer this question via an approach of textual concept-based explanations, showing their effectiveness, and perform an analysis encompassing a pool of 13 CLIP models varying in architecture, size and pretraining datasets. We explore those different aspect in relation to mutual knowledge, and analyze zero-shot predictions. Our approach demonstrates an effective and human-friendly way of understanding zero-shot classification decisions with CLIP.

Analysing Multi-Task Regression via Random Matrix Theory with Application to Time Series Forecasting
In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for multi-task regression, applying random matrix theory to provide precise performance estimations, under high-dimensional, non-Gaussian data distributions. We formulate a multi-task optimization problem as a regularization technique to enable single-task models to leverage multi-task learning information. We derive a closed-form solution for multi-task optimization in the context of linear models. Our analysis provides valuable insights by linking the multi-task learning performance to various model statistics such as raw data covariances, signal-generating hyperplanes, noise levels, as well as the size and number of datasets. We finally propose a consistent estimation of training and testing errors, thereby offering a robust foundation for hyperparameter optimization in multi-task regression scenarios. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world datasets in regression and multivariate time series forecasting demonstrate improvements on univariate models, incorporating our method into the training loss and thus leveraging multivariate information.

Analysis of Corrected Graph Convolutions
Machine learning for node classification on graphs is a prominent area driven by applications such as recommendation systems. State-of-the-art models often use multiple graph convolutions on the data, as empirical evidence suggests they can enhance performance. However, it has been shown empirically and theoretically, that too many graph convolutions can degrade performance significantly, a phenomenon known as oversmoothing. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, based on the contextual stochastic block model (CSBM), of the performance of vanilla graph convolution from which we remove the principal eigenvector to avoid oversmoothing. We perform a spectral analysis for $k$ rounds of corrected graph convolutions, and we provide results for partial and exact classification. For partial classification, we show that each round of convolution can reduce the misclassification error exponentially up to a saturation level, after which performance does not worsen. For exact classification, we show that the separability threshold can be improved exponentially up to $O({\log{n}}/{\log\log{n}})$ corrected convolutions.

Analytic Nonlinear Dynamical System Identification with Non-asymptotic Guarantees
We study the theoretical guarantees of system identification methods for a class of unknown nonlinear systems in stochastic settings, incorporating analytic functions in the presence of disturbances. Within this framework, we explore two primary system identification methods: least-squares estimator (LSE), classified as point estimators, aimed at estimating a specific point within a parameter space, and set-membership estimator (SME) , classified as set estimators, which estimate a set to ensure inclusion of the true parameters. Both approaches rely on sample data generated by the system. Despite the widespread application of such estimators, their non-asymptotic guarantees within a nonlinear framework in stochastic settings remain limited. Specifically, we provide probabilistic guarantees for error bounds of LSE and for the diameters of sets estimated by SME. Our analysis is grounded in probabilistic persistent excitation within these nonlinear systems with i.i.d. noises. We demonstrate numerical experiments showcasing the system identification of systems such as pendulum and quadrotor.

Analyzing & Reducing the Need for Learning Rate Warmup in Neural Network Optimization
Learning Rate Warmup is a popular heuristic for training neural networks, especially at larger batch sizes. By definition, it must aid training by downscaling early model updates, but what is not clear is: Why and by which criteria are early updates too large? This work empirically explores this question for small GPT training by assessing and controlling the update size via various metrics. We find the relative update magnitude of weight matrices to be particularly informative, explicitly controlling this simple quantity can sometimes be sufficient to replace warmup, especially when combined with high momentum. However, parameter based measures fail to account for changes in the "critical batch size" or signal-to-noise ratio of the gradient throughout training, which warmup can also help counteract. We show how quantifying the update magnitude in terms of neural representations offers a promising approach to address this and effectively control the update size, reducing the need for explicit warmup.

An Any-to-Any Vision Model for Tens of Tasks and Modalities
Current multimodal and multitask foundation models like 4M or UnifiedIO show promising results, but in practice their out-of-the-box abilities to accept diverse inputs and perform diverse tasks are limited by the (usually rather small) number of modalities and tasks they are trained on. In this paper, we expand upon the capabilities of them by training a single model on tens of highly diverse modalities and by performing co-training on large-scale multimodal datasets and text corpora. This includes training on several semantic and geometric modalities, feature maps from recent state of the art models like DINOv2 and ImageBind, pseudo labels of specialist models like SAM and 4DHumans, and a range of new modalities that allow for novel ways to interact with the model and steer the generation, for example image metadata or color palettes. A crucial step in this process is performing discrete tokenization on various modalities, whether they are image-like, neural network feature maps, vectors, structured data like instance segmentation or human poses, or data that can be represented as text. Through this, we expand on the out-of-the-box capabilities of multimodal models and specifically show the possibility of training one model to solve at least 3x more tasks/modalities than existing ones and doing so without a loss in performance. This enables more fine-grained and controllable multimodal generation capabilities and allows us to study the distillation of models trained on diverse data and objectives into a unified model. We successfully scale the training to a three billion parameter model using tens of modalities and different datasets. The resulting models and training code will be open sourced upon acceptance.

An Autoencoder-Like Nonnegative Matrix Co-Factorization for Improved Student Cognitive Modeling
We present a new learned model of student cognition for better predicting student exercise performance and estimating his/her knowledge proficiency in a subject. Data mining approaches such as matrix factorization can obtain high accuracy in predicting student performance on exercises, but the knowledge proficiency is unknown or poorly estimated. The situation is further exacerbated if only sparse interactions exist between exercises and students (or knowledge concepts). To solve this dilemma, we root monotonicity – a fundamental psychometric theory on educational assessments – in a co-factorization framework and present an autoencoder-like nonnegative matrix co-factorization (AE-NMCF), which improves the accuracy of estimating the student's knowledge proficiency via an end-to-end learning pipeline. The resulting estimation problem is nonconvex with nonnegative constraints. We introduce a projected gradient method based on block coordinate descent with Lipschitz constants and guarantee the method's theoretical convergence. Experiments on several real-world data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in terms of both performance prediction accuracy and knowledge estimation ability, when compared with existing student cognitive models.

A Near-optimal Algorithm for Learning Margin Halfspaces with Massart Noise
We study the problem of PAC learning $\gamma$-margin halfspaces in the presence of Massart noise. Without computational considerations, the sample complexity of this learning problem is known to be $\widetilde{\Theta}(1/(\gamma^2 \epsilon))$. Prior computationally efficient algorithms for the problem incur sample complexity $\tilde{O}(1/(\gamma^4 \epsilon^3))$ and achieve 0-1 error of $\eta+\epsilon$.Recent work gave evidence of an information-computation tradeoff, suggesting that a quadratic dependence on $1/\epsilon$ is required for computationally efficient algorithms. Our main result is a computationally efficient learner with sample complexity $\widetilde{\Theta}(1/(\gamma^2 \epsilon^2))$, essentially matching this lower bound. In addition, our algorithm is simple and practical, running in sample-linear time.

An effective framework for estimating individualized treatment rule with multi-category treatments
Estimating individualized Treatment Rules (ITRs) is fundamental in causal inference, particularly for precision medicine applications. Traditional ITR estimation methods rely on inverse probability weighting (IPW) to address confounding factors and $L_{1}$-penalization for simplicity and interpretability. However, IPW can introduce statistical bias without precise propensity score modeling, while $L_{1}$-penalization gives computational bias and requires subgradient methods, which slows down the convergence of optimization algorithms for ITR estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel ITR estimation framework formulated as a weighted convex optimization problem. The weights are obtained via model-free distributional covariate balancing, and instead of soft $L_{1}$-penalization, we use hard $L_{1}$-ball constraint, allowing the objective to maintain smoothness. The optimal ITR can be robustly and effectively computed by projected gradient descent (PGD). We provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed framework including global convergence and complexity guarantee of the PGD algorithm and statistical estimation guarantee under natural generative ITR models. Extensive simulations and applications demonstrate that our framework achieves significant gains in both robustness and effectiveness for ITR learning against several existing methods.

An Efficient Memory Module for Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning
Graph incremental learning has gained widespread attention for its ability to mitigate catastrophic forgetting for graph neural networks (GNN). Conventional methods typically require numerous labels for node classification. However, obtaining abundant labels is often challenging in practice, which makes graph few-shot incremental learning necessary. Current approaches rely on large number of samples from meta-learning to construct memories, and heavy fine-tuning of the GNN parameters that lead to the loss of past knowledge. These result in significant memory consumption and loss of past knowledge information, respectively. To tackle these issues, We introduce Mecoin to efficient construct and Preserve memory. For efficient storage and update of class prototypes, Mecoin use Structured Memory Unit (SMU) to cache prototypes of the seen classes and update new class prototypes through interaction between nodes and the cached prototypes by Memory Construction module(MeCo). Besides, to avoid extensive parameter fine-tuning and forgetting, we introduce a Memory Representation Adaptive Module called MRaM to separate the learning of prototypes and class representations and use Graph Knowledge Interchange Module (GKIM) to injects past knowledge information into GNN. We analyze the effectiveness of our paradigm from the perspectives of generalization error, and discuss the impact of different distillation methods on model performance through experiments and VC-dimension. By comparison with other related methods, we validate that Mecoin achieves higher accuracy and lower forgetting rate.

An End-To-End Graph Attention Network Hash for Cross-Modal Retrieval
Due to its low storage cost and fast search speed, cross-modal retrieval based on hashing has attracted widespread attention and is widely used in real-world applications of social media search. However, most existing hashing methods are often limited by uncomprehensive feature representations and semantic associations, which greatly restricts their performance and applicability in practical applications. To deal with this challenge, in this paper we propose an end-to-end graph attention network hash (EGATH) for cross modal retrieval, which can not only capture direct semantic associations between images and texts but also match semantic content between different modalities. We adopt the CLIP combined with the Transformer to improve understanding and generalization ability in semantic consistency across different data modalities. The classifier base on graph attention network is conducted to obtain predicted labels for enhance cross-modal feature representation. We construct hash codes using an optimization strategy and loss function to preserve the semantic information and compactness of the hash code. Comprehensive experimental on the NUS-WIDE, MIRFlickr25K, and MS-COCO benchmark datasets show that our EGATH significantly performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods.

An engine not a camera: Measuring performative power of online search
The power of digital platforms is at the center of major ongoing policy and regulatory efforts. To advance existing debates, we designed and executed an experiment to measure the power of online search providers, building on the recent definition of performative power. Instantiated in our setting, performative power quantifies the ability of a search engine to steer web traffic by rearranging results. To operationalize this definition we developed a browser extension that performs unassuming randomized experiments in the background. These randomized experiments emulate updates to the search algorithm and identify the causal effect of different content arrangements on clicks. Analyzing tens of thousands of clicks, we consistently find  significant effects of minimal arrangement changes. For example, down-ranking the first item by one position and adding visually appealing elements on top of the page results in a click reduction of more than $50%$ on average across queries. Relating our quantitative findings to performative power, we discuss what our robust quantitative insights say about the power of online search engines.

A Neural Network Approach for Efficiently Answering Most Probable Explanation Queries in Probabilistic Models
We propose a novel neural networks based approach to efficiently answer arbitrary Most Probable Explanation (MPE) queries—a well-known NP-hard task—in large probabilistic models such as Bayesian and Markov networks, probabilistic circuits, and neural auto-regressive models. By arbitrary MPE queries, we mean that there is no predefined partition of variables into evidence and non-evidence variables. The key idea is to distill all MPE queries over a given probabilistic model into a neural network and then use the latter for answering queries, eliminating the need for time-consuming inference algorithms that operate directly on the probabilistic model. We improve upon this idea by incorporating inference-time optimization with self-supervised loss to iteratively improve the solutions and employ a teacher-student framework that provides a better initial network, which in turn, helps reduce the number of inference-time optimization steps. The teacher network utilizes a self-supervised loss function optimized for getting the exact MPE solution, while the student network learns from the teacher's near-optimal outputs through supervised loss. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on various datasets and a broad class of probabilistic models, showcasing its practical effectiveness.

A New Neural Kernel Regime: The Inductive Bias of Multi-Task Training
This paper studies the properties of solutions to multi-task shallow ReLU neural network training problems.  Remarkably, solutions to multi-task problems can be identical to those of kernel methods, revealing a novel connection between neural networks and kernel methods.  We focus on the problem of interpolating training data subject to minimizing the sum of squared weights in the network.  It is known that the functions that result from such single-task training problems solve a minimum norm interpolation problem in a non-Hilbertian Banach space and are generally non-unique.  Moreover, the multiple solutions can be significantly different from each other and can exhibit undesirable behaviors such as making large excursions from the training data. In contrast, the solutions to multi-task training problems are strikingly different.  In univariate settings, we prove that the solution to multi-task training is almost always unique and that the solution to each individual task is equivalent to minimum norm interpolation in a Sobolev (Reproducing Kernel) Hilbert space.  Moreover, the unique multi-task solution has desirable generalization properties that the single-task solutions can lack. We also provide empirical evidence and mathematical analysis which shows that multivariate multi-task training can also lead to solutions that are related to a minimum $\ell^2$-norm (Hilbert space) interpolation.

An Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Training Clean Diffusion Models from Corrupted Observations
Diffusion models excel in solving imaging inverse problems due to their ability to model complex image priors. However, their reliance on large, clean datasets for training limits their practical use where clean data is scarce. In this paper, we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) approach to train diffusion models from corrupted observations. Our method alternates between reconstructing clean images from corrupted data using a known diffusion model (E-step) and refining diffusion model weights based on these reconstructions (M-step). This iterative process leads the learned diffusion model to gradually converge to the true clean data distribution. We validate our method through extensive experiments on diverse computational imaging tasks, including random inpainting, denoising, and deblurring, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

An Image is Worth 32 Tokens for Reconstruction and Generation
Recent advancements in generative models have highlighted the crucial role of image tokenization in the efficient synthesis of high-resolution images. Tokenization, which transforms images into latent representations, reduces computational demands compared to directly processing pixels and enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of the generation process. Prior methods, such as VQGAN, typically utilize 2D latent grids with fixed downsampling factors. However, these 2D tokenizations face challenges in managing the inherent redundancies present in images, where adjacent regions frequently display similarities. To overcome this issue, we introduce **T**ransformer-based 1-D**i**mensional **Tok**enizer (TiTok), an innovative approach that tokenizes images into 1D latent sequences. TiTok provides a more compact latent representation, yielding substantially more efficient and effective representations than conventional techniques. For example, a 256 × 256 × 3 image can be reduced to just **32** discrete tokens, a significant reduction from the 256 or 1024 tokens obtained by prior methods. Despite its compact nature, TiTok achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, using the same generator framework, TiTok attains **1.97** gFID, outperforming MaskGIT baseline significantly by 4.21 at ImageNet 256 × 256 benchmark. The advantages of TiTok become even more significant when it comes to higher resolution. At ImageNet 512 × 512 benchmark, TiTok not only outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion model DiT-XL/2 (gFID 2.74 vs. 3.04), but also reduces the image tokens by 64×, leading to **410× faster** generation process. Our best-performing variant can significantly surpasses DiT-XL/2 (gFID **2.13** vs. 3.04) while still generating high-quality samples **74× faster**. Codes and models will be made publicly available.

Animal-Bench: Benchmarking Multimodal Video Models for Animal-centric Video Understanding
With the emergence of large pre-trained multimodal video models, multiple benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate model capabilities. However, most of the benchmarks are human-centric, with evaluation data and tasks centered around human applications. Animals are an integral part of the natural world, and animal-centric video understanding is crucial for animal welfare and conservation efforts. Yet, existing benchmarks overlook evaluations focused on animals, limiting the application of the models. To alleviate this issue, our work establishes an animal-centric benchmark, namely Animal-Bench, to allow for a broader assessment of model capabilities in real-world contexts, overcoming agent-bias in previous benchmarks. Animal-Bench includes 13 tasks encompass both common tasks shared with humans and special tasks relevant to animal conservation, spanning 7 major animal categories and 822 species, comprising a total of 52,236 data entries. To generate this evaluation benchmark, we defined a task system centered on animals and proposed an automated pipeline for animal-centric data processing. To further validate the robustness of models against real-world challenges, we utilize a video editing approach to simulate realistic scenarios like weather change and shooting parameters due to animal movement. We evaluated 8 current multimodal video models using our benchmark and found considerable room for improvement. We hope our work provides insights for the community and opens up new avenues for research in multimodal video models.

Animate3D: Animating Any 3D Model with Multi-view Video Diffusion
Recent advances in 4D generation mainly focus on generating 4D content by distilling pre-trained text or single-view image conditioned models. It is inconvenient for them to take advantage of various off-the-shelf 3D assets with multi-view attributes, and their results suffer from spatiotemporal inconsistency owing to the inherent ambiguity in the supervision signals. In this work, we present Animate3D, a novel framework for animating any static 3D model. The core idea is two-fold: 1) We propose a novel multi-view video diffusion model (MV-VDM) conditioned on multi-view renderings of the static 3D object, which is trained on our presented large-scale multi-view video dataset (MV-Video). 2) Based on MV-VDM, we introduce a framework combining reconstruction and 4D Score Distillation Sampling (4D-SDS) to leverage the multi-view video diffusion priors for animating 3D objects. Specifically, for MV-VDM, we design a new spatiotemporal attention module to enhance spatial and temporal consistency by integrating 3D and video diffusion models. Additionally, we leverage the static 3D model’s multi-view renderings as conditions to preserve its identity. For animating 3D models, an effective two-stage pipeline is proposed: we first reconstruct coarse motions directly from generated multi-view videos, followed by the introduced 4D-SDS to model fine-level motions. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Animate3D significantly outperforms previous approaches. Data, code, and models will be open-released.

An Improved Empirical Fisher Approximation for Natural Gradient Descent
Approximate Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) methods are an important family of optimisers for deep learning models, which use approximate Fisher information matrices to pre-condition gradients during training. The empirical Fisher (EF) method approximates the Fisher information matrix empirically by reusing the per-sample gradients collected during back-propagation. Despite its ease of implementation, the EF approximation has its theoretical and practical limitations. This paper first investigates the *inversely-scaled projection* issue of EF, which is shown to be a major cause of the poor empirical approximation quality. An improved empirical Fisher (iEF) method, motivated as a generalised NGD method from a loss reduction perspective, is proposed to address this issue, meanwhile retaining the practical convenience of EF. The exact iEF and EF methods are experimentally evaluated using practical deep learning setups, including widely-used setups for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained models (T5-base with LoRA and Prompt-Tuning on GLUE tasks, and ViT with LoRA for CIFAR100). Optimisation experiments show that applying exact iEF as an optimiser provides strong convergence and generalisation. It achieves the best test performance and the lowest training loss for majority of the tasks, even when compared with well-tuned AdamW/Adafactor baselines. Additionally, under a novel empirical evaluation framework, the proposed iEF method shows consistently better approximation quality to the exact Natural Gradient updates than both EF and the more expensive sampled Fisher (SF). Further investigation also shows that the superior approximation quality of iEF is robust to damping across tasks and training stages. Improving existing approximate NGD optimisers with iEF is expected to lead to better convergence ability and stronger robustness to choice of damping.

AnonFair: A Flexible Toolkit for Algorithmic Fairness
We present AnonFair, a new open source toolkit for enforcing algorithmic fairness. Compared to existing toolkits: (i) We support NLP and Computer Vision classification as well as standard tabular problems. (ii) We support enforcing fairness on validation data, making us robust to a wide-range of overfitting challenges. (iii) Our approach can optimize any measure that is a function of  True Positives, False Positive, False Negatives, and True Negatives. This makes it easily extendable, and much more expressive than existing toolkits. It supports 9/9 and 10/10 of the group metrics of two popular review papers. AnonFair is compatible with standard ML toolkits including sklearn, Autogluon and pytorch and is freely available online.

A Non-parametric Direct Learning Approach to Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation under Unmeasured Confounding
In many social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences, treatment effect estimation is a crucial step in understanding the impact of an intervention, policy, or treatment. In recent years, an increasing emphasis has been placed on heterogeneity in treatment effects, leading to the development of various methods for estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE). These approaches hinge on a crucial identifying condition of no unmeasured confounding, an assumption that is not always guaranteed in observational studies or randomized control trials with non-compliance. In this paper, we proposed a general framework for estimating CATE with a possible unmeasured confounder using Instrumental Variables. We also construct estimators that exhibit greater efficiency and robustness against various scenarios of model misspecification. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through simulation studies and a real data example.

ANT: Adaptive Noise Schedule for Time Series Diffusion Models
Advances in diffusion models for generative artificial intelligence have recently propagated to the time series (TS) domain, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, prior works on TS diffusion models often borrow the framework of existing works proposed in other domains without considering the characteristics of TS data, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose Adaptive Noise schedule for Time series diffusion models (ANT), which automatically predetermines proper noise schedules for given TS datasets based on their statistics representing non-stationarity. Our intuition is that an optimal noise schedule should satisfy the following desiderata: 1) It linearly reduces the non-stationarity of TS data so that all diffusion steps are equally meaningful, 2) the data is corrupted to the random noise at the final step, and 3) the number of steps is sufficiently large. The proposed method is practical for use in that it eliminates the necessity of finding the optimal noise schedule with a small additional cost to compute the statistics for given datasets, which can be done offline before training. We validate the effectiveness of our method across various tasks, including TS forecasting, refinement, and generation, on datasets from diverse domains.

AnyFit: Controllable Virtual Try-on for Any Combination of Attire Across Any Scenario
While image-based virtual try-on has made significant strides, emerging approaches still fall short of delivering high-fidelity and robust fitting images across various scenarios, as their models suffer from issues of ill-fitted garment styles and quality degrading during the training process, not to mention the lack of support for various combinations of attire. Therefore, we first propose a lightweight, scalable, operator known as Hydra Block for attire combinations. This is achieved through a parallel attention mechanism that facilitates the feature injection of multiple garments from conditionally encoded branches into the main network. Secondly, to significantly enhance the model's robustness and expressiveness in real-world scenarios, we evolve its potential across diverse settings by synthesizing the residuals of multiple models, as well as implementing a mask region boost strategy to overcome the instability caused by information leakage in existing models. Equipped with the above design, AnyFit surpasses all baselines on high-resolution benchmarks and real-world data by a large gap, excelling in producing well-fitting garments replete with photorealistic and rich details. Furthermore, AnyFit’s impressive performance on high-fidelity virtual try-ons in any scenario from any image, paves a new path for future research within the fashion community.

A Pairwise Pseudo-likelihood Approach for Matrix Completion with Informative Missingness
While several recent matrix completion methods are developed to deal with non-uniform observation probabilities across matrix entries, very few allow the missingness to depend on the mostly unobserved matrix measurements, which is generally ill-posed. We aim to tackle a subclass of these ill-posed settings, characterized by a flexible separable observation probability assumption that can depend on the matrix measurements. We propose a regularized pairwise pseudo-likelihood approach for matrix completion and prove that the proposed estimator can asymptotically recover the low-rank parameter matrix up to an identifiable equivalence class of a constant shift and scaling, at a near-optimal asymptotic convergence rate of the standard well-posed (non-informative missing) setting, while effectively mitigating the impact of informative missingness. The efficacy of our method is validated via numerical experiments, positioning it as a robust tool for matrix completion to mitigate data bias.

A PID Controller Approach for Adaptive Probability-dependent Gradient Decay in Model Calibration
Modern deep learning models often exhibit overconfident predictions, inadequately capturing uncertainty. During model optimization, the expected calibration error tends to overfit  earlier than classification accuracy, indicating distinct optimization objectives for classification error and calibration error. To ensure consistent optimization of both model accuracy and model calibration, we propose a novel method incorporating a probability-dependent gradient decay coefficient into loss function. This coefficient exhibits a strong correlation with the overall confidence level.  To maintain model calibration during optimization, we utilize a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to dynamically adjust this gradient decay rate, where the adjustment relies on the proposed relative calibration error feedback in each epoch, thereby preventing the model from exhibiting over-confidence or under-confidence. Within the PID control system framework, the proposed relative calibration error serves as the control system output, providing an indication of the overall confidence level, while the gradient decay rate functions as the controlled variable. Moreover, recognizing the impact of gradient amplitude of adaptive decay rates, we implement an adaptive learning rate mechanism for gradient compensation to prevent inadequate learning of over-small gradient. Empirical experiments validate the efficacy of our PID-based adaptive gradient decay rate approach, ensuring consistent optimization of model calibration and model accuracy.

APIGen: Automated PIpeline for Generating Verifiable and Diverse Function-Calling Datasets
The advancement of function-calling agent models requires diverse, reliable, and high-quality datasets. This paper presents APIGen, an automated data generation pipeline designed to produce verifiable high-quality datasets for function-calling applications. We leverage APIGen and collect 3,673 executable APIs across 21 different categories to generate diverse function-calling datasets in a scalable and structured manner. Each data in our dataset is verified through three hierarchical stages: format checking, actual function executions, and semantic verification, ensuring its reliability and correctness. We demonstrate that models trained with our curated datasets, even with only 7B parameters, can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function-Calling Benchmark, outperforming multiple GPT-4 models. Moreover, our 1B model achieves exceptional performance, surpassing GPT-3.5-Turbo and Claude-3 Haiku. We release a dataset containing 60,000 high-quality entries, aiming to advance the field of function-calling agent domains.

A Polar Coordinate System Explicitly Represents Syntax in Language Models
First formalized with symbolic representations, syntactic trees have recently been shown to be partially represented in the activations of language models: by optimizing a “Structural Probe”, one can find a linear read-out of the activations such that syntactically related words are close together. However, the distance between contextualized word embeddings provided by such Structural Probe can only represent the presence – but not the type – of syntactic relations. Here, we hypothesize that the types of syntactic relations between a pair of words can be read from the relative orientation of their contextualized embeddings. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a “Polar Probe” and optimize it with a contrastive objective encouraging all pairs of words sharing the same syntactic relation to point in a consistent and specific direction. We demonstrate three main results. First, the Polar Probe successfully recovers the type of syntactic relations, and substantially outperforms the Structural Probe by nearly two folds. Second, we confirm that this polar coordinate system exists in a variety of trained language models like BERT, Mistral and Llama-2, and is best read-out from their intermediate layers. Third, we demonstrate with a new linguistic benchmark that similar syntactic relations occurring at different levels of the syntactic tree have similar orientations. Overall, this work shows that there exists a polar coordinate system which represents syntax as a labeled directed acyclic graph in language models, where the presence and type of syntactic relations are represented by distances and angles, respectively. This syntactic code bridges the historical gap between the symbolic representations of linguistics and the vectorial representations of neural networks.

Applying Guidance in a Limited Interval Improves Sample and Distribution Quality in Diffusion Models
Guidance is a crucial technique for extracting the best performance out of image-generating diffusion models. Traditionally, a constant guidance weight has been applied throughout the sampling chain of an image. We show that guidance is clearly harmful toward the beginning of the chain (high noise levels), largely unnecessary toward the end (low noise levels), and only beneficial in the middle. We thus restrict it to a specific range of noise levels, improving both the inference speed and result quality. This limited guidance interval improves the record FID in ImageNet-512 significantly, from 1.81 to 1.40. We show that it is quantitatively and qualitatively beneficial across different sampler parameters, network architectures, and datasets, including the large-scale setting of Stable Diffusion XL. We thus suggest exposing the guidance interval as a hyperparameter in all diffusion models that use guidance.

Approximated Orthogonal Projection Unit: Stabilizing Regression Network Training Using Natural Gradient
Neural networks (NN) are extensively studied in cutting-edge soft sensor models due to their  feature extraction and function approximation capabilities. Current research into network-based methods primarily focuses on models' offline accuracy. Notably, in industrial soft sensor context, online optimizing stability and interpretability are prioritized, followed by accuracy. This requires a clearer understanding of network's training process. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel NN named the Approximated Orthogonal Projection Unit (AOPU) which has solid mathematical basis and presents superior training stability. AOPU truncates the gradient backpropagation at dual parameters, optimizes the trackable parameters updates, and enhances the robustness of training. We further prove that AOPU attains minimum variance estimation in NN, wherein the truncated gradient approximates the natural gradient. Empirical results on two chemical process datasets clearly show that AOPU outperforms other models in achieving stable convergence, marking a significant advancement in soft sensor field.

Approximately Equivariant Neural Processes
Equivariant deep learning architectures exploit symmetries in learning problems to improve the sample efficiency of neural-network-based models and their ability to generalise. However, when modelling real-world data, learning problems are often not *exactly* equivariant, but only approximately. For example, when estimating the global temperature field from weather station observations, local topographical features like mountains break translation equivariance. In these scenarios, it is desirable to construct architectures that can flexibly depart from exact equivariance in a data-driven way. In this paper, we develop a general approach to achieving this using existing equivariant architectures. Our approach is agnostic to both the choice of symmetry group and model architecture, making it widely applicable. We consider the use of approximately equivariant architectures in neural processes (NPs), a popular family of meta-learning models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a number of synthetic and real-world regression experiments, demonstrating that approximately equivariant NP models can outperform both their non-equivariant and strictly equivariant counterparts.

Approximately Pareto-optimal Solutions for Bi-Objective k-Clustering
As a major unsupervised learning method, clustering has received a lot of attention over multiple decades. The various clustering problems that have been studied intensively include, e.g., the $k$-means problem and the $k$-center problem. However, in applications, it is common that good clusterings should optimize multiple objectives (e.g., visualizing data on a map by clustering districts into areas that are both geographically compact but also homogeneous with respect to the data).  We study combinations of different objectives, for example optimizing $k$-center and $k$-means simultaneously or optimizing $k$-center with respect to two different metrics. Usually these objectives are conflicting and cannot be optimized simultaneously, making it necessary to find trade-offs. We develop novel algorithms for computing the set of Pareto-optimal solutions (approximately) for various combinations of two objectives. Our algorithms achieve provable approximation guarantees and we demonstrate in several experiments that the (approximate) Pareto set contains good clusterings that cannot be found by considering one of the objectives separately.

Approximating the Top Eigenvector in Random Order Streams
When rows of an $n \times d$ matrix $A$ are given in a stream, we study algorithms for approximating the top eigenvector of $A^T A$ (equivalently, the top right singular vector of $A$). We consider worst case inputs $A$ but assume that the rows are presented to the streaming algorithm in a uniformly random order. We show that when the gap parameter $R = \sigma_1(A)^2/\sigma_2(A)^2 = \Omega(1)$, then there is a randomized algorithm that uses $O(h \cdot d \cdot \text{polylog}(d))$ bits of space and outputs a unit vector $v$ that has a correlation $1 - O(1/\sqrt{R})$ with the top eigenvector $v_1$. Here $h$ denotes the number of ``heavy rows'' in the matrix, defined as the rows with Euclidean norm at least $\|{A}\|_F/\sqrt{d \cdot \text{polylog}(d)}$. We also provide a lower bound showing that any algorithm using $O(hd/R)$ bits of space can obtain at most $1 - \Omega(1/R^2)$ correlation with the top eigenvector. Thus, parameterizing the space complexity in terms of the number of heavy rows is necessary for high accuracy solutions.Our results improve upon the $R = \Omega(\log n \cdot \log d)$ requirement  in a recent work of Price. We note that Price's algorithm works for arbitrary order streams whereas our algorithm requires a stronger assumption that the rows are presented in a uniformly random order. We additionally show that the gap requirements in Price's analysis can be brought down to $R = \Omega(\log^2 d)$ for arbitrary order streams and $R = \Omega(\log d)$ for random order streams. The requirement of $R = \Omega(\log d)$ for random order streams is nearly tight for Price's analysis as we obtain a simple instance with $R = \Omega(\log d/\log\log d)$ for which Price's algorithm, with any fixed learning rate, cannot output a vector approximating the top eigenvector $v_1$.

Approximation Rate of the Transformer Architecture for Sequence Modeling
The Transformer architecture is widely applied in sequence modeling applications, yet the theoretical understanding of its working principles remains limited. In this work, we investigate the approximation rate for single-layer Transformers with one head. We consider general non-linear relationships and identify a novel notion of complexity measures to establish an explicit Jackson-type approximation rate estimate for the Transformer. This rate reveals the structural properties of the Transformer and suggests the types of sequential relationships it is best suited for approximating. In particular, the results on approximation rates enable us to concretely analyze the differences between the Transformer and classical sequence modeling methods, such as recurrent neural networks.

Architect: Generating Vivid and Interactive 3D Scenes with Hierarchical 2D Inpainting
Creating large-scale interactive 3D environments is essential for the development of Robotics and Embodied AI research. However, generating diverse embodied environments with realistic detail and considerable complexity remains a significant challenge. Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing $\textit{Architect}$, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. While there are still challenges that the camera parameters and scale of depth are still absent in the generated image, we address those problems by ''controlling'' the diffusion model by $\textit{hierarchical inpainting}$. Specifically, having access to ground-truth depth and camera parameters in simulation, we first render a photo-realistic image of only the background. Then, we inpaint the foreground in this image, passing the geometric cues to the inpainting model in the background, which informs the camera parameters.This process effectively controls the camera parameters and depth scale for the generated image, facilitating the back-projection from 2D image to 3D point clouds. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate the placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments. Experimental results demonstrate that $\textit{Architect}$ outperforms existing methods in producing realistic and complex environments, making it highly suitable for Embodied AI and robotics applications.

Are Large-scale Soft Labels Necessary for Large-scale Dataset Distillation?
In ImageNet-condensation, the storage for auxiliary soft labels exceeds that of the condensed dataset by over 30 times.However, are large-scale soft labels necessary for large-scale dataset distillation?In this paper, we first discover that the high within-class similarity in condensed datasets necessitates the use of large-scale soft labels.This high within-class similarity can be attributed to the fact that previous methods use samples from different classes to construct a single batch for batch normalization (BN) matching.To reduce the within-class similarity, we introduce class-wise supervision during the image synthesizing process by batching the samples within classes, instead of across classes.As a result, we can increase within-class diversity and reduce the size of required soft labels.A key benefit of improved image diversity is that soft label compression can be achieved through simple random pruning, eliminating the need for complex rule-based strategies. Experiments validate our discoveries.For example, when condensing ImageNet-1K to 200 images per class, our approach compresses the required soft labels from 113 GB to 2.8 GB (40$\times$ compression) with a 2.6\% performance gain.

Are nuclear masks all you need for improved out-of-domain generalization? A closer look at cancer classification in histopathology.
Driven by a higher need for reliability, computational histopathology faces challenges in generalizing across domains due to variations in staining procedures and imaging equipment used by different hospitals. We focus on methodically simple options to improve results, which can be applied to a wide range of architectures. We draw inspiration from the tradition of shape-based recognition by hypothesizing that focusing on nuclei will improve the out-of-domain generalization in cancer detection. We propose training with a mixture of original images and segmentation masks while leaving the test time protocol unchanged. Going beyond mere data augmentation, we show that regularization, which enforces a higher similarity between mask and image representation, is a required component to achieve better out-of-domain generalization. Furthermore, we evaluate sensitivity to image corruptions and show that the proposed method improves robustness to such image distortions.

A Retrospective on the Robot Air Hockey Challenge: Benchmarking Robust, Reliable, and Safe Learning Techniques for Real-world Robotics
Machine learning methods have a groundbreaking impact in many application domains, but their application on real robotic platforms is still limited. Despite the many challenges associated with combining machine learning technology with robotics, robot learning remains one of the most promising directions for enhancing the capabilities of robots. When deploying learning-based approaches on real robots, extra effort is required to address the challenges posed by various factors in the real world. To investigate the key factors influencing real-world deployment and to encourage original solutions from different researchers, we organized the Robot Air Hockey Challenge at the NeurIPS 2023 conference. We selected the air hockey task as a benchmark, encompassing low-level robotics problems and high-level tactics. Different from other machine learning-centric benchmarks, participants need to tackle practical challenges in robotics, such as the sim-to-real gap, the low-level control issues, the safety problem, real-time requirements, and limited availability to real-world data. The competition's results show that learning-based approaches with prior knowledge integration still outperform the data-driven approaches when building a deployable robotics solution. The ablation study provides us insights into which real-world factors may be overlooked when building a learning-based solution. The real-world air hockey deployment of best-performing agents sets the foundation for future competitions and follow-up research directions.

Are Your Models Still Fair? Fairness Attacks on Graph Neural Networks via Node Injections
Despite the remarkable capabilities demonstrated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in graph-related tasks, recent research has revealed the fairness vulnerabilities in GNNs when facing malicious adversarial attacks. However, all existing fairness attacks require manipulating the connectivity between existing nodes, which may be prohibited in reality. To this end, we introduce a Node Injection-based Fairness Attack (NIFA), exploring the vulnerabilities of GNN fairness in such a more realistic setting. In detail, NIFA first designs two insightful principles for node injection operations, namely the uncertainty-maximization principle and homophily-increase principle, and then optimizes injected nodes’ feature matrix to further ensure the effectiveness of fairness attacks. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets consistently demonstrate that NIFA can significantly undermine the fairness of mainstream GNNs, even including fairness-aware GNNs, by injecting merely 1% of nodes. We sincerely hope that our work can stimulate increasing attention from researchers on the vulnerability of GNN fairness, and encourage the development of corresponding defense mechanisms.

A robust inlier identification algorithm for point cloud registration via $\mathbf{\ell_0}$-minimization
Correspondences in point cloud registration are prone to outliers, significantly reducing registration accuracy and highlighting the need for precise inlier identification. In this paper, we propose a robust inlier identification algorithm for point cloud registration by reformulating the conventional registration problem as an alignment error $\ell_0$-minimization problem. The $\ell_0$-minimization problem is formulated for each local set, where those local sets are built on a compatibility graph of input correspondences. To resolve the $\ell_0$-minimization, we develop a novel two-stage decoupling strategy, which first decouples the alignment error into a rotation fitting error and a translation fitting error. Second, null-space matrices are employed to decouple inlier identification from the estimation of rotation and translation respectively, thereby applying Bayesian theory to $\ell_0$-minimization problems and solving for fitting errors. Correspondences with the smallest errors are identified as inliers to generate a transformation hypothesis for each local set. The best hypothesis is selected to perform registration. We demonstrate that the proposed inlier identification algorithm is robust under high outlier ratios and noise through experiments. Extensive results on the KITTI, 3DMatch, and 3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both traditional and learning-based methods in various indoor and outdoor scenes.

AROMA: Preserving Spatial Structure for Latent PDE Modeling with Local Neural Fields
We present AROMA (Attentive Reduced Order Model with Attention), a framework designed to enhance the modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs) using local neural fields. Our flexible encoder-decoder architecture can obtain smooth latent representations of spatial physical fields from a variety of data types, including irregular-grid inputs and point clouds. This versatility eliminates the need for patching and allows efficient processing of diverse geometries. The sequential nature of our latent representation can be interpreted spatially and permits the use of a conditional transformer for modeling the temporal dynamics of PDEs. By employing a diffusion-based formulation, we achieve greater stability and enable longer rollouts compared to conventional MSE training. AROMA's superior performance in simulating 1D and 2D equations underscores the efficacy of our approach in capturing complex dynamical behaviors.

Articulate your NeRF: Unsupervised articulated object modeling via conditional view synthesis
We propose a novel unsupervised method to learn pose and part-segmentation of articulated objects with rigid parts.    Given two observations of an object in different articulation states, our method learns the geometry and appearance of object parts by using an implicit model from the first observation, distills the part segmentation and articulation from the second observation while rendering the latter observation.    Additionally, to tackle the complexities in the joint optimization of part segmentation and articulation, we propose a voxel grid based initialization strategy and a decoupled optimization procedure.    Compared to the prior unsupervised work, our model obtains significantly better performance, generalizes to objects with multiple parts while it can be efficiently from few views for the latter observation.

AsCAN: Asymmetric Convolution-Attention Networks for Efficient Recognition and Generation
Neural network architecture design requires making many crucial decisions. The common desiderata is that similar decisions, with little modifications, can be reused in a variety of tasks and applications. To satisfy that, architectures must provide promising latency and performance trade-offs, support a variety of tasks, scale efficiently with respect to the amounts of data and compute, leverage available data from other tasks, and efficiently support various hardware. To this end, we introduce AsCAN---a hybrid architecture, combining both convolutional and transformer blocks. We revisit the key design principles of hybrid architectures and propose a simple and effective \emph{asymmetric} architecture, where the distribution of convolutional and transformer blocks is \emph{asymmetric}, containing more convolutional blocks in the earlier stages, followed by more transformer blocks in later stages. AsCAN supports a variety of tasks: recognition, segmentation, class-conditional image generation, and features a superior trade-off between performance and latency. We then scale the same architecture to solve a large-scale text-to-image task and show state-of-the-art performance compared to the most recent public and commercial models. Notably, without performing any optimization of inference time our model shows faster execution, even when compared to works that do such optimization, highlighting the advantages and the value of our approach.

A Siamese Transformer with Hierarchical Refinement for Lane Detection
Lane detection is an important yet challenging task in autonomous driving systems. Existing lane detection methods mainly rely on finer-scale information to identify key points of lane lines. Since local information in realistic road environments is frequently obscured by other vehicles or affected by poor outdoor lighting conditions, these methods struggle with the regression of such key points. In this paper, we propose a novel Siamese Transformer with hierarchical refinement for lane detection to improve the detection accuracy in complex road environments. Specifically, we propose a high-to-low hierarchical refinement Transformer structure, called LAne TRansformer (LATR), to refine the key points of lane lines, which integrates global semantics information and finer-scale features. Moreover, exploiting the thin and long characteristics of lane lines, we propose a novel Curve-IoU loss to supervise the fit of lane lines. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of lane detection demonstrate that our proposed new method achieves state-of-the-art results with high accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our method achieves improved F1 scores on the OpenLane dataset, surpassing the current best-performing method by 5.0 points. Our code will be released.

A Simple and Optimal Approach for Universal Online Learning with Gradient Variations
We investigate the problem of universal online convex optimization with problem-dependent regret. Universal methods aim to achieve provable regret without requiring the curvature information of the online functions in advance. Additionally, we study the problem-dependent gradient-variation regret because it can imply small-loss bounds (another well-known problem-dependent quantity) and is essential in bridging stochastic and adversarial optimization. In this work, we design a universal approach with the *optimal* gradient-variation regret guarantees simultaneously for strongly convex, exp-concave, and convex functions, thus addressing an open problem highlighted by Yan et al. [2023]. Our approach is *simple* since it is efficient-to-implement with a two-layer online ensemble structure and only one gradient query within each round, and easy-to-analyze with a novel solution to gradient-variation bounds. Previous works on gradient variations require controlling the algorithmic stability, which is challenging and thus leads to sub-optimal regret and complicated algorithm design. Our analysis in this work overcomes this issue via a novel and alternative solution to gradient-variation bounds.

A Simple Framework for Generalization in Visual RL under Dynamic Scene Perturbations
In the rapidly evolving domain of vision-based deep reinforcement learning (RL), a pivotal challenge is to achieve generalization capability to dynamic environmental changes reflected in visual observations.Our work delves into the intricacies of this problem, identifying two key issues that appear in previous approaches for visual RL generalization: (i) imbalanced saliency and (ii) observational overfitting.Imbalanced saliency is a phenomenon where an RL agent disproportionately identifies salient features across consecutive frames in a frame stack. Observational overfitting occurs when the agent focuses on certain background regions rather than task-relevant objects.To address these challenges, we present a simple yet effective framework for generalization in visual RL (SimGRL) under dynamic scene perturbations.First, to mitigate the imbalanced saliency problem, we introduce an architectural modification to the image encoder to stack frames at the feature level rather than the image level.Simultaneously, to alleviate the observational overfitting problem, we propose a novel technique based on shifted random overlay augmentation, which is specifically designed to learn robust representations capable of effectively handling dynamic visual scenes.Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization capability of SimGRL, achieving state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks including the DeepMind Control Suite.

A Simple Image Segmentation Framework via In-Context Examples
Recently, there have been explorations of generalist segmentation models that can effectively tackle a variety of image segmentation tasks within a unified in-context learning framework. However, these methods still struggle with task ambiguity in in-context segmentation, as not all in-context examples can accurately convey the task information. In order to address this issue, we present SINE, a simple image $\textbf{S}$egmentation framework utilizing $\textbf{in}$-context $\textbf{e}$xamples. Our approach leverages a Transformer encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder provides high-quality image representations, and the decoder is designed to yield multiple task-specific output masks to effectively eliminate task ambiguity. Specifically, we introduce an In-context Interaction module to complement in-context information and produce correlations between the target image and the in-context example and a Matching Transformer that uses fixed matching and a Hungarian algorithm to eliminate differences between different tasks. In addition, we have further perfected the current evaluation system for in-context image segmentation, aiming to facilitate a holistic appraisal of these models. Experiments on various segmentation tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A Single-Step, Sharpness-Aware Minimization is All You Need to Achieve Efficient and Accurate Sparse Training
Sparse training stands as a landmark approach in addressing the considerable training resource demands imposed by the continuously expanding size of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, the training of a sparse DNN encounters great challenges in achieving optimal generalization ability despite the efforts from the state-of-the-art sparse training methodologies. To unravel the mysterious reason behind the difficulty of sparse training, we connect the network sparsity with neural loss functions structure, and identify the cause of such difficulty lies in chaotic loss surface. In light of such revelation, we propose $S^{2} - SAM$, characterized by a **S**ingle-step **S**harpness_**A**ware **M**inimization that is tailored for **S**parse training. For the first time, $S^{2} - SAM$ innovates the traditional SAM-style optimization by approximating sharpness perturbation through prior gradient information, incurring *zero extra cost*. Therefore,  $S^{2} - SAM$ not only exhibits the capacity to improve generalization but also aligns with the efficiency goal of sparse training. Additionally, we study the generalization result of $S^{2} - SAM$ and provide theoretical proof for convergence. Through extensive experiments, $S^{2} - SAM$ demonstrates its universally applicable plug-and-play functionality, enhancing accuracy across various sparse training methods. Code will be released.

Ask, Attend, Attack: A Effective Decision-Based Black-Box Targeted Attack for Image-to-Text Models
While image-to-text models have demonstrated significant advancements in various vision-language tasks, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks. Existing white-box attacks on image-to-text models require access to the architecture, gradients, and parameters of the target model, resulting in low practicality. Although the recently proposed gray-box attacks have improved practicality, they suffer from semantic loss during the training process, which limits their targeted attack performance. To advance adversarial attacks of image-to-text models, this paper focuses on a challenging scenario: decision-based black-box targeted attacks where the attackers only have access to the final output text and aim to perform targeted attacks. Specifically, we formulate the decision-based black-box targeted attack as a large-scale optimization problem. To efficiently solve the optimization problem, a three-stage process \textit{Ask, Attend, Attack}, called \textit{AAA}, is proposed to coordinate with the solver. \textit{Ask} guides attackers to create target texts that satisfy the specific semantics. \textit{Attend} identifies the crucial regions of the image for attacking, thus reducing the search space for the subsequent \textit{Attack}. \textit{Attack} uses an evolutionary algorithm to attack the crucial regions, where the attacks are semantically related to the target texts of \textit{Ask}, thus achieving targeted attacks without semantic loss. Experimental results on transformer-based and CNN+RNN-based image-to-text models confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed \textit{AAA}.

Assemblage: Automatic Binary Dataset Construction for Machine Learning
Binary code is pervasive, and binary analysis is a key task in reverse engineering, malware classification, and vulnerability discovery. Unfortunately, while there exist large corpuses of malicious binaries, obtaining high-quality corpuses of benign binaries for modern systems has proven challenging (e.g., due to licensing issues). Consequently, machine learning based pipelines for binary analysis utilize either costly commercial corpuses (e.g., VirusTotal) or open-source binaries (e.g., coreutils) available in limited quantities. To address these issues, we present Assemblage: an extensible cloud-based distributed system that crawls, configures, and builds Windows PE binaries to obtain high-quality binary corpuses suitable for training state-of-the-art models in binary analysis. We have run Assemblage on AWS over the past year, producing 890k Windows PE and 428k Linux ELF binaries across 29 configurations. Assemblage is designed to be both reproducible and extensible, enabling users to publish "recipes" for their datasets, and facilitating the extraction of a wide array of features. We evaluated Assemblage by using its data to train modern learning-based pipelines for compiler provenance and binary function similarity. Our results illustrate the practical need for robust corpuses of high-quality Windows PE binaries in training modern learning-based binary analyses.

Association of Objects May Engender Stereotypes: Mitigating Association-Engendered Stereotypes in Text-to-Image Generation
Text-to-Image (T2I) has witnessed significant advancements, demonstrating superior performance for various generative tasks. However, the presence of stereotypes in T2I introduces harmful biases that require urgent attention as the T2I  technology becomes more prominent.Previous work for stereotype mitigation mainly concentrated on mitigating stereotypes engendered with individual objects within images, which failed to address stereotypes engendered by the association of multiple objects, referred to as Association-Engendered Stereotypes. For example, mentioning  "black people" and "houses"  separately in prompts may not exhibit stereotypes. Nevertheless, when these two objects are associated in prompts, the association of "black people" with "poorer houses" becomes more pronounced. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework, MAS, to Mitigate Association-engendered Stereotypes. This framework models the stereotype problem as a probability distribution alignment problem, aiming to align the stereotype probability distribution of the generated image with the stereotype-free distribution. The MAS framework primarily consists of the Text-Image-Text CLIP (TIT CLIP) and Sensitive Transformer. The TIT CLIP learns the association between prompts, images, and stereotypes, which can establish the mapping of prompts to stereotypes. The Sensitive Transformer produces the sensitive constraints, which guide the stereotyped image distribution to align with the stereotype-free probability distribution. Moreover, recognizing that existing metrics are insufficient for accurately evaluating association-engendered stereotypes, we propose a novel metric, Stereotype-Distribution-Total-Variation (SDTV), to evaluate stereotypes in T2I. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates association-engendered stereotypes.

A structure-aware framework for learning device placements on computation graphs
Existing approaches for device placement ignore the topological features of computation graphs and rely mostly on heuristic methods for graph partitioning. At the same time, they either follow a grouper-placer or an encoder-placer architecture, which requires understanding the interaction structure between code operations. To bridge the gap between encoder-placer and grouper-placer techniques, we propose a novel framework for the task of device placement, relying on smaller computation graphs extracted from the OpenVINO toolkit using reinforcement learning. The framework consists of five steps, including graph coarsening, node representation learning and policy optimization. It facilitates end-to-end training and takes into consideration the directed and acyclic nature of the computation graphs.We also propose a model variant, inspired by graph parsing networks and complex network analysis, enabling graph representation learning and personalized graph partitioning jointly, using an unspecified number of groups. To train the entire framework, we utilize reinforcement learning techniques by employing the execution time of the suggested device placements to formulate the reward. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our approach through multiple experiments with three benchmark models, namely Inception-V3, ResNet, and BERT. The robustness of the proposed framework is also highlighted through an ablation study. The suggested placements improve the inference speed for the benchmark models by up to $58.2\%$ over CPU execution and by up to $60.24\%$ compared to other commonly used baselines.

Asymptotics of Alpha-Divergence Variational Inference Algorithms with Exponential Families
Recent works in Variational Inference have examined alternative criteria to the commonly used exclusive Kullback-Leibler divergence. Encouraging empirical results have been obtained with the family of alpha-divergences, but few works have focused on the asymptotic properties of the proposed algorithms, especially as the number of iterations goes to infinity. In this paper, we study a procedure that ensures a monotonic decrease in the alpha-divergence. We provide sufficient conditions to guarantee its convergence to a local minimizer of the alpha-divergence at a geometric rate when the variational family belongs to the class of exponential models. The sample-based version of this ideal procedure involves biased gradient estimators, thus hindering any theoretical study. We propose an alternative unbiased algorithm, we prove its almost sure convergence to a local minimizer of the alpha-divergence, and a law of the iterated logarithm. Our results are exemplified with toy and real-data experiments.

AsyncDiff: Parallelizing Diffusion Models by Asynchronous Denoising
Diffusion models have garnered significant interest from the community for their great generative ability across various applications. However, their typical multi-step sequential-denoising nature gives rise to high cumulative latency, thereby precluding the possibilities of parallel computation. To address this, we introduce AsyncDiff, a universal and plug-and-play acceleration scheme that enables model parallelism across multiple devices. Our approach divides the cumbersome noise prediction model into multiple components, assigning each to a different device. To break the dependency chain between these components, it transforms the conventional sequential denoising into an asynchronous process by exploiting the high similarity between hidden states in consecutive diffusion steps. Consequently, each component is facilitated to compute in parallel on separate devices. The proposed strategy significantly reduces inference latency while minimally impacting the generative quality. Specifically, for the Stable Diffusion v2.1, AsyncDiff achieves a 2.7x speedup with negligible degradation and a 4.0x speedup with only a slight reduction of 0.38 in CLIP Score, on four NVIDIA A5000 GPUs. Our experiments also demonstrate AsyncDiff can be readily applied to video diffusion models with encouraging performances.

Asynchronous Perception Machine for Test Time Training
In this work, we propose Asynchronous Perception Machine (APM), a computationally-efficient architecture for test-time-training (TTT). APM can process patches of an image one at a time in any order asymmetrically and still encode semantic-awareness. We demonstrate APM's ability to recognize out-of-distribution images without dataset-specific pre-training, and its competitive classification performance over existing TTT approaches. To perform TTT, APM just distills test sample's representation once. APM possesses a unique property: it can learn using just this single representation and starts predicting semantically-aware features. We demonstrate APM's potential application beyond test-time-training: APM can scale up to a dataset of 2D images and yield semantic-clusterings in a single forward pass. APM also provides first empirical evidence of GLOM's insight, i.e. percept is really a field. Therefore, APM helps us converge towards an implementation which can  do  both interpolation and perception on a shared-connectionist hardware. Our codebase has been provided for review and will be made publicly-available. --------**It now appears that some of the ideas in GLOM could be made to work.**https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/16/1021871/geoffrey-hinton-glom-godfather-ai-neural-networks/

A Taxonomy of Challenges to Curating Fair Datasets
Despite extensive efforts to create fairer machine learning (ML) datasets, there remains a limited understanding of the practical aspects of dataset curation. Drawing from interviews with 30 ML dataset curators, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of the challenges and trade-offs encountered throughout the dataset curation lifecycle. Our findings underscore overarching issues within the broader fairness landscape that impact data curation. We conclude with recommendations aimed at fostering systemic changes to better facilitate fair dataset curation practices.

A theoretical design of concept sets: improving the predictability of Concept Bottleneck Models
Concept-based learning, a promising approach in machine learning, emphasizes the value of high-level representations called concepts. However, despite growing interest in concept-bottleneck models (CBMs), there is a lack of clear understanding regarding the properties of concept sets and their impact on model performance. In this work, we define concepts within the machine learning context, highlighting their core properties: 'expressiveness' and 'model-aware inductive bias', and we make explicit the underlying assumption of CBMs. We establish theoretical results for concept-bottleneck models (CBMs), revealing how these properties guide the design of concept sets that optimize model performance. Specifically, we demonstrate that well-chosen concept sets can improve sample efficiency and out-of-distribution robustness in the appropriate regimes. Based on these insights, we propose a method to effectively identify informative and non-redundant concepts. We validate our approach with experiments on CIFAR-10 and MetaShift, showing that concept-bottleneck models outperform the foundational embedding counterpart, particularly in low-data regimes and under distribution shifts. We also examine failure modes and discuss how they can be tackled.

Atlas3D: Physically Constrained Self-Supporting Text-to-3D for Simulation and Fabrication
Existing diffusion-based text-to-3D generation methods primarily focus on producing visually realistic shapes and appearances, often neglecting the physical constraints necessary for downstream tasks. Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.

A Topology-aware Graph Coarsening Framework for Continual Graph Learning
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) experience "catastrophic forgetting" in continual learning setups, where they tend to lose previously acquired knowledge and perform poorly on old tasks. Rehearsal-based methods, which consolidate old knowledge with a replay memory buffer, are a de facto solution due to their straightforward workflow. However, these methods often fail to adequately capture topological information, leading to incorrect input-label mappings in replay samples. To address this, we propose TACO, a topology-aware graph coarsening and continual learning framework that stores information from previous tasks as a reduced graph. Throughout each learning period, this reduced graph expands by integrating with a new graph and aligning shared nodes, followed by a "zoom-out" reduction process to maintain a stable size. We have developed a graph coarsening algorithm based on node representation proximities to efficiently reduce a graph while preserving essential topological information. We empirically demonstrate that the learning process on the reduced graph can closely approximate that on the original graph. We compare TACO with a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines, proving its superiority and the necessity of preserving high-quality topological information for effective replaying.

Attack-Aware Noise Calibration for Differential Privacy
Differential privacy (DP) is a widely used approach for mitigating privacy risks when training machine learning models on sensitive data. DP mechanisms add noise during training to limit the risk of information leakage. The scale of the added noise is critical, as it determines the trade-off between privacy and utility. The standard practice is to select the noise scale in terms of a _privacy budget parameter_ $\varepsilon$. This parameter is in turn interpreted in terms of operational _attack risk_, such as accuracy, sensitivity or specificity of inference attacks against the training data. We demonstrate that this two-step procedure of first calibrating the noise scale to a privacy budget $\varepsilon$, and then translating $\varepsilon$ to attack risk leads to overly conservative risk assessments and unnecessarily low utility. We propose methods to directly calibrate the noise scale to a desired attack risk level, bypassing the intermediate step of choosing $\varepsilon$. For a target attack risk, our approach significantly decreases noise scale, leading to increased utility at the same level of privacy. We empirically demonstrate that calibrating noise to attack sensitivity/specificity, rather than $\varepsilon$, when training privacy-preserving ML models substantially improves model accuracy fot the same risk level. Our work provides a principled and practical way to improve the utility of privacy-preserving ML without compromising on privacy.

Attack-Resilient Image Watermarking Using Stable Diffusion
Watermarking images is critical for tracking image provenance and proving ownership. With the advent of generative models, such as stable diffusion, that can create fake but realistic images, watermarking has become particularly important to make human-created images reliably identifiable. Unfortunately, the very same stable diffusion technology can remove watermarks injected using existing methods.To address this problem, we present ZoDiac, which uses a pre-trained stable diffusion model to inject a watermark into the trainable latent space, resulting in watermarks that can be reliably detected in the latent vector even when attacked. We evaluate ZoDiac on three benchmarks, MS-COCO, DiffusionDB, and WikiArt, and find that ZoDiac is robust against state-of-the-art watermark attacks, with a watermark detection rate above 98% and a false positive rate below 6.4%, outperforming state-of-the-art watermarking methods. We hypothesize that the reciprocating denoising process in diffusion models may inherently enhance the robustness of the watermark when faced with strong attacks and validate the hypothesis. Our research demonstrates that stable diffusion is a promising approach to robust watermarking, able to withstand even stable-diffusion-based attack methods.

Attention boosted Individualized Regression
Different from classical one-model-fits-all strategy, individualized models allow parameters to vary across samples and are gaining popularity in various fields, particularly in personalized medicine. Motivated by medical imaging analysis, this paper introduces a novel individualized modeling framework for matrix-valued data that does not require additional information on sample similarity for the individualized coefficients. Under our framework, the model individualization stems from an optimal internal relation map within the samples themselves. We refer to the proposed method as Attention boosted Individualized Regression, due to its close connections with the self-attention mechanism. Therefore, our approach provides a new interpretation for  attention from the perspective of individualized modeling. Comprehensive numerical experiments and real brain MRI analysis using an ADNI dataset demonstrated the superior performance of our model.

Attributing Model Behavior at Scale (ATTRIB)
Recently-developed algorithmic innovations (e.g., transformers, diffusion models , state-space models) and large-scale datasets (e.g., Common Crawl, LAION) have given rise to machine learning models with impressive capabilities. As the cost of training such large models grows, and as systems based on them are used widely, it is increasingly important to understand how different design choices combine to induce observed behaviors. For example, we still do not fully understand how the composition of training datasets influences model behavior (e.g., how does training on code data affect reasoning capabilities in other domains?),  how to attribute capabilities to subcomponents (e.g., can we identify which subnetwork of an LLM implements addition), and which algorithmic choices really drive performance (e.g., how can we best align models to human preferences?). Behavioral attribution is also important in light of recent concerns about harmful model behavior and several works suggest that these behaviors can be attributed to training data or model architecture and size.The core challenge in all of these questions is that of *model behavior attribution*.That is, the question of relating model behavior back to factors in the machine learning pipeline---such as the choice of training dataset or particular training algorithm---that produced this model. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners that advance our understanding of model behavior attribution in the contexts that span data, model understanding, and algorithmic interventions.

AUC Maximization under Positive Distribution Shift
Maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is a popular approach to imbalanced binary classification problems. Existing AUC maximization methods usually assume that training and test distributions are identical. However, this assumption is often violated in practice due to {\it a positive distribution shift}, where the negative-conditional density does not change but the positive-conditional density can vary. This shift often occurs in imbalanced classification since positive data are often more diverse and time-varying than negative data. To deal with this shift, we theoretically show that the AUC on the test distribution can be expressed by using the positive and marginal training densities and the marginal test density. Based on this result, we can maximize the AUC on the test distribution by using positive and unlabeled data in the training distribution and unlabeled data in the test distribution. The proposed method requires only positive labels in the training distribution as supervision. Moreover, the derived AUC has a simple form and thus is easy to implement. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown with four real-world datasets.

AUCSeg: AUC-oriented Pixel-level Long-tail Semantic Segmentation
The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a well-known metric for evaluating instance-level long-tail learning problems. In the past two decades, many AUC optimization methods have been proposed to improve model performance under long-tail distributions. In this paper, we explore AUC optimization methods in the context of pixel-level long-tail semantic segmentation, a much more complicated scenario. This task introduces two major challenges for AUC optimization techniques. On one hand, AUC optimization in a pixel-level task involves complex coupling across loss terms, with structured inner-image and pairwise inter-image dependencies, complicating theoretical analysis. On the other hand, we find that mini-batch estimation of AUC loss in this case requires a larger batch size, resulting in an unaffordable space complexity. To address these issues, we develop a pixel-level AUC loss function and conduct a dependency-graph-based theoretical analysis of the algorithm's generalization ability. Additionally, we design a Tail-Classes Memory Bank (T-Memory Bank) to manage the significant memory demand. Finally, comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our proposed AUCSeg method.

Auditing Local Explanations is Hard
In sensitive contexts, providers of machine learning algorithms are increasingly required to give explanations for their algorithms' decisions. However, explanation receivers might not trust the provider, who potentially could output misleading or manipulated explanations. In this work, we investigate an auditing framework in which a third-party auditor or a collective of users attempts to sanity-check explanations: they can query model decisions and the corresponding local explanations, pool all the information received, and then check for basic consistency properties. We prove upper and lower bounds on the amount of queries that are needed for an auditor to succeed within this framework. Our results show that successful auditing requires a potentially exorbitant number of queries -- particularly in high dimensional cases. Our analysis also reveals that a key property is the ``locality'' of the provided explanations --- a quantity that so far has not been paid much attention to in the explainability literature. Looking forward, our results suggest that for complex high-dimensional settings, merely providing a pointwise prediction and explanation could be insufficient, as there is no way for the users to verify that the provided explanations are not completely made-up.

A Unified Framework for 3D Scene Understanding
We propose UniSeg3D, a unified 3D segmentation framework that achieves panoptic, semantic, instance, interactive, referring, and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks within a single model. Most previous 3D segmentation approaches are specialized for a specific task, thereby limiting their understanding of 3D scenes to a task-specific perspective. In contrast, the proposed method unifies six tasks into unified representations processed by the same Transformer. It fascinates inter-task knowledge sharing and, therefore, promotes comprehensive 3D scene understanding. To take advantage of multi-task unification, we enhance the performance by leveraging task connections. Specifically, we design a knowledge distillation method and a contrastive learning method to transfer task-specific knowledge across different tasks. Benefiting from extensive inter-task knowledge sharing, our UniSeg3D becomes more powerful. Experiments on three benchmarks, including the ScanNet, ScanRefer, and ScanNet200, demonstrate that the UniSeg3D consistently outperforms current SOTA methods, even those specialized for individual tasks. We hope UniSeg3D can serve as a solid unified baseline and inspire future work. The code will be publicly available.

A Unified Principle of Pessimism for Offline Reinforcement Learning under Model Mismatch
In this paper, we address the challenges of offline reinforcement learning (RL) under model mismatch, where the agent aims to optimize its performance through an offline dataset that may not accurately represent the deployment environment. We identify two primary challenges under the setting: inaccurate model estimation due to limited data and performance degradation caused by the model mismatch between the dataset-collecting environment and the target deployment one. To tackle these issues, we propose a unified principle of pessimism using distributionally robust Markov decision processes. We carefully construct a robust MDP with a single uncertainty set to tackle both data sparsity and model mismatch, and demonstrate that the optimal robust policy enjoys a near-optimal sub-optimality gap under the target environment across three widely used uncertainty models: total variation, $\chi^2$ divergence, and KL divergence. Our results improve upon or match the state-of-the-art performance under the total variation and KL divergence models, and provide the first result for the $\chi^2$ divergence model.

A Unifying Normative Framework of Decision Confidence
Self-assessment of one’s choices, i.e., confidence, is the topic of many decision neuroscience studies. Computational models of confidence, however, are limited to specific scenarios such as between choices with the same value. Here we present a normative framework for modeling decision confidence that is generalizable to various tasks and experimental setups. We further drive the implications of our model from both theoretical and experimental points of view. Specifically, we show that our model maps to the planning as an inference framework where the objective function is maximizing the gained reward and information entropy of the policy. Moreover, we validate our model on two different psychophysics experiments and show its superiority over other approaches in explaining subjects' confidence reports.

A Universal Growth Rate for Learning with Smooth Surrogate Losses
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the growth rate of $H$-consistency bounds (and excess error bounds) for various surrogate losses used in classification. We prove a square-root growth rate near zero for smooth margin-based surrogate losses in binary classification, providing both upper and lower bounds under mild assumptions. This result also translates to excess error bounds. Our lower bound requires weaker conditions than those in previous work for excess error bounds, and our upper bound is entirely novel. Moreover, we extend this analysis to multi-class classification with a series of novel results, demonstrating a universal square-root growth rate for smooth *comp-sum* and *constrained losses*, covering common choices for training neural networks in multi-class classification. Given this universal rate, we turn to the question of choosing among different surrogate losses. We first examine how $H$-consistency bounds vary across surrogates based on the number of classes. Next, ignoring constants and focusing on behavior near zero, we identify *minimizability gaps* as the key differentiating factor in these bounds. Thus, we thoroughly analyze these gaps, to guide surrogate loss selection, covering: comparisons across different comp-sum losses, conditions where gaps become zero, and general conditions leading to small gaps.  Additionally, we demonstrate the key role of minimizability gaps in comparing excess error bounds and $H$-consistency bounds.

Automated Efficient Estimation using Monte Carlo Efficient Influence Functions
Many practical problems involve estimating low dimensional statistical quantities with high-dimensional models and datasets. Several approaches address these estimation tasks based on the theory of influence functions, such as debiased/double ML or targeted minimum loss estimation. We introduce \textit{Monte Carlo Efficient Influence Functions} (MC-EIF), a fully automated technique for approximating efficient influence functions that integrates seamlessly with existing differentiable probabilistic programming systems. MC-EIF automates efficient statistical estimation for a broad class of models and functionals that previously required rigorous custom analysis. We prove that MC-EIF is consistent, and that estimators using MC-EIF achieve optimal $\sqrt{N}$ convergence rates. We show empirically that estimators using MC-EIF are at parity with estimators using analytic EIFs. Finally, we present a novel capstone example using MC-EIF for optimal portfolio selection.

Automated Label Unification for Multi-Dataset Semantic Segmentation with GNNs
Deep supervised models possess significant capability to assimilate extensive training data, thereby presenting an opportunity to enhance model performance through training on multiple datasets. However, conflicts arising from different label spaces among datasets may adversely affect model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically construct a unified label space across multiple datasets using graph neural networks. This enables semantic segmentation models to be trained simultaneously on multiple datasets, resulting in performance improvements. Unlike existing methods, our approach facilitates seamless training without the need for additional manual reannotation or taxonomy reconciliation. This significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of multi-dataset segmentation model training. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other multi-dataset training methods when trained on seven datasets simultaneously, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WildDash 2 benchmark.

Automating Data Annotation under Strategic Human Agents: Risks and Potential Solutions
As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used in social domains to make consequential decisions about humans, they often have the power to reshape data distributions. Humans, as strategic agents, continuously adapt their behaviors in response to the learning system. As populations change dynamically, ML systems may need frequent updates to ensure high performance. However, acquiring high-quality *human-annotated* samples can be highly challenging and even infeasible in social domains. A common practice to address this issue is using the model itself to annotate unlabeled data samples. This paper investigates the long-term impacts when ML models are retrained with *model-annotated* samples when they incorporate human strategic responses. We first formalize the interactions between strategic agents and the model and then analyze how they evolve under such dynamic interactions. We find that agents are increasingly likely to receive positive decisions as the model gets retrained, whereas the proportion of agents with positive labels may decrease over time. We thus propose a *refined retraining process* to stabilize the dynamics. Last, we examine how algorithmic fairness can be affected by these retraining processes and find that enforcing common fairness constraints at every round may not benefit the disadvantaged group in the long run. Experiments on (semi-)synthetic and real data validate the theoretical findings.

Autoregressive Image Diffusion: Generating Image Sequence and Application in MRI
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive imaging modality. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing image quality with imaging speed. This trade-off is primarily constrained by k-space measurements, which traverse specific trajectories in the spatial Fourier domain (k-space). These measurements are often undersampled to shorten acquisition times, resulting in image artifacts and compromised quality. Generative models learn image distributions and can be used to reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled k-space data. In this work, we present the autoregressive image diffusion (AID) model for image sequences and use it to sample the posterior for accelerated MRI reconstruction. The algorithm incorporates both undersampled k-space and pre-existing information. Models trained with fastMRI dataset are evaluated comprehensively. The results show that the AID model can robustly generate sequentially coherent image sequences. In 3D and dynamic MRI, the AID can outperform the standard diffusion model and reduce hallucinations, due to the learned inter-image dependencies.

Average gradient outer product as a mechanism for deep neural collapse
Deep Neural Collapse (DNC) refers to the surprisingly rigid structure of the data representations in the final layers of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Though the phenomenon has been measured in a variety of settings, its emergence is typically explained via data-agnostic approaches, such as the unconstrained features model. In this work, we introduce a data-dependent setting where DNC forms due to feature learning through the average gradient outer product (AGOP). The AGOP is defined with respect to a learned predictor and is equal to the uncentered covariance matrix of its input-output gradients averaged over the training dataset. Deep Recursive Feature Machines are a method that constructs a neural network by iteratively mapping the data with the AGOP and applying an untrained random feature map. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that DNC occurs in Deep Recursive Feature Machines as a consequence of the projection with the AGOP matrix computed at each layer. We then provide evidence that this mechanism holds for neural networks more generally. We show that the right singular vectors and values of the weights can be responsible for the majority of within-class variability collapse for DNNs trained in the feature learning regime. As observed in recent work, this singular structure is highly correlated with that of the AGOP.

A Versatile Diffusion Transformer with Mixture of Noise Levels for Audiovisual Generation
Training diffusion models for audiovisual sequences allows for a range of generation tasks by learning conditional distributions of various input-output combinations of the two modalities. Nevertheless, this strategy often requires training a separate model for each task which is expensive. Here, we propose a novel training approach to effectively learn arbitrary conditional distributions in the audiovisual space. Our key contribution lies in how we parameterize the diffusion timestep in the forward diffusion process. Instead of the standard fixed diffusion timestep, we propose applying variable diffusion timesteps across the temporal dimension and across modalities of the inputs. This formulation offers flexibility to introduce variable noise levels for various portions of the input, hence the term mixture of noise levels. We propose a transformer-based audiovisual latent diffusion model and show that it can be trained in a task-agnostic fashion using our approach to enable a variety of audiovisual generation tasks at inference time. Experiments demonstrate the versatility of our method in tackling cross-modal and multimodal interpolation tasks in the audiovisual space. Notably, our proposed approach surpasses baselines in generating temporally and perceptually consistent samples conditioned on the input. Project page: neurips13025.github.io

A versatile informative diffusion model for single-cell ATAC-seq data generation and analysis
The rapid advancement of single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) technologies holds great promise for investigating the heterogeneity of epigenetic landscapes at the cellular level. The amplification process in scATAC-seq experiments often introduces noise due to dropout events, which results in extreme sparsity that hinders accurate analysis. Consequently, there is a significant demand for the generation of high-quality scATAC-seq data in silico. Furthermore, current methodologies are typically task-specific, lacking a versatile framework capable of handling multiple tasks within a single model. In this work, we propose ATAC-Diff, a versatile framework, which is based on a diffusion model conditioned on the latent auxiliary variables to adapt for various tasks. ATAC-Diff is the first diffusion model for the scATAC-seq data generation and analysis, composed of auxiliary modules encoding the latent high-level variables to enable the model to learn the semantic information to sample high-quality data. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the latent prior and auxiliary decoder, the yield variables reserve the refined genomic information beneficial for downstream analyses. Another innovation is the incorporation of mutual information between observed and hidden variables as a regularization term to prevent the model from decoupling from latent variables. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ATAC-Diff achieves high performance in both generation and analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Avoiding Undesired Future with Minimal Cost in Non-Stationary Environments
Machine learning (ML) has achieved remarkable success in prediction tasks. In many real-world scenarios, rather than solely predicting an outcome using an ML model, the crucial concern is how to make decisions to prevent the occurrence of undesired outcomes, known as the *AUF (avoiding undesired future)* problem. To this end, a new framework called *rehearsal learning* has been proposed recently, which works effectively in stationary environments by leveraging the influence relations among variables. In real tasks, however, the environments are usually non-stationary, where influence relations are *dynamic* and can lead to the failure of AUF by the existing method. In this paper, we present a novel sequential methodology to effectively deal with the non-stationarity and maintain the estimates of dynamic influence relations, which are essential for rehearsal learning to avoid undesired outcomes. Meanwhile, we take the cost of decision actions into account and formulate the AUF problem with minimal action cost in non-stationary environments. We prove that in linear cases, the formulated problem can be transformed into the well-studied convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). In this way, we establish the first polynomial-time rehearsal-based approach for addressing the AUF problem. We provide the theoretical guarantees of our method, and experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.

B$\oplus$LD: Boolean Logic Deep Learning
Deep learning is computationally intensive, with significant efforts focused on reducing arithmetic complexity, particularly regarding energy consumption dominated by data movement. While existing literature emphasizes inference, training is considerably more resource-intensive. This paper proposes a novel mathematical principle by introducing the notion of Boolean variation such that neurons made of Boolean weights and inputs can be trained ---for the first time--- efficiently in Boolean domain using Boolean logic instead of gradient descent and real arithmetic. We explore its convergence, conduct extensively experimental benchmarking, and provide consistent complexity evaluation by considering chip architecture, memory hierarchy, dataflow, and arithmetic precision. Our approach achieves baseline full-precision accuracy in ImageNet classification and surpasses state-of-the-art results in semantic segmentation, with notable performance in image super-resolution, and natural language understanding with transformer-based models. Moreover, it significantly reduces energy consumption during both training and inference.

Back to the Continuous Attractors
Continuous attractors offer a unique class of solutions for storing continuous-values in recurrent system states indefinitely.Unfortunately, the continuous attractors suffer from severe structural instability in general---they are destroyed by most infinitesimal changes of the dynamical law.This fragility limits their utility especially in biological systems as their recurrent dynamics are subject to constant perturbations.We observe that the bifurcations from continuous attractors in theoretical neuroscience models display various structurally stable forms.Although their asymptotic behaviors of memory are categorically distinct, their finite time behaviors are similar and degrade gracefully.Fast-slow decomposition analysis uncovers the persistent manifold that survives the seemingly destructive bifurcation.Moreover, the recurrent neural networks trained on analog memory tasks display approximate continuous attractors with predicted slow manifold structures.Therefore, continuous attractors are functionally robust and remain useful as a universal analogy for understanding analog memory.

Balancing Context Length and Mixing Times for Reinforcement Learning at Scale
Due to the recent remarkable advances in artificial intelligence, researchers have begun to consider challenging learning problems such as learning to generalize behavior from large offline datasets or learning online in non-Markovian environments. Meanwhile, recent advances in both of these areas have increasingly relied on conditioning policies on large context lengths. A natural question is if there is a limit to the performance benefits of increasing the context length if the computation needed is available. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical result that links the context length of a policy to the time needed to reliably evaluate its performance (i.e., its mixing time) in large scale partially observable reinforcement learning environments that exhibit latent sub-task structure. This analysis underscores a key tradeoff: when we extend the context length, our policy can more effectively model non-Markovian dependencies, but this comes at the cost of potentially slower policy evaluation and as a result slower downstream learning. Moreover, our empirical results highlight the relevance of this analysis when leveraging Transformer based neural networks. This perspective will become increasingly pertinent as the field scales towards larger and more realistic environments, opening up a number of potential future directions for improving the way we design learning agents.

Balancing Multimodal Learning with Classifier-guided Gradient Modulation
Multimodal learning has developed very fast in recent years. However, during the multimodal training process, the model tends to rely on only one modality based on which it could learn faster, thus leading to inadequate use of other modalities. Existing methods to balance the training process always have some limitations on the loss function, optimizers and the number of modalities and only consider modulating the magnitude of the gradients while ignoring the directions of the gradients. To solve these problems, in this paper, we present a novel method to balance multimodal learning with **C**lassifier-**G**uided **G**radient **M**odulation (CGGM), considering both the magnitude and directions of the gradients. We conduct extensive experiments on four multimodal datasets: UPMC-Food 101, CMU-MOSI, IEMOCAP and BraTS 2021, covering classification, regression and segmentation tasks. The results show that CGGM outperforms all the baselines and other gradient modulation methods consistently, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility. Our codes will be publicly available.

BAN: Detecting Backdoors Activated by Neuron Noise
Backdoor attacks on deep learning represent a recent threat that has gained significant attention in the research community. Backdoor defenses are mainly based on backdoor inversion, which has been shown to be generic, model-agnostic, and applicable to practical threat scenarios. State-of-the-art backdoor inversion recovers a mask in the feature space to locate prominent backdoor features, where benign and backdoor features can be disentangled. However, it suffers from high computational overhead, and we also find that it overly relies on prominent backdoor features that are highly distinguishable from benign features. To tackle these shortcomings, this paper improves backdoor feature inversion for backdoor detection by incorporating extra neuron activation information.  In particular, we adversarially increase the loss of backdoored models with respect to weights to activate the backdoor effect, based on which we can easily differentiate backdoored and clean models. Experimental results demonstrate our defense, BAN, is 1.37$\times$ (on CIFAR-10) and 5.11$\times$ (on ImageNet200) more efficient with 9.99\% higher detect success rate than the state-of-the-art defense BTI-DBF~\cite{xu2024btidbf}. Our code and trained models are publicly available at this anonymous link (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ban-4B32).

B-ary Tree Push-Pull Method is Provably Efficient for Distributed Learning on Heterogeneous Data
This paper considers the distributed learning problem where a group of agents cooperatively minimizes the summation of their local cost functions based on peer-to-peer communication. Particularly, we propose a highly efficient algorithm, termed ``B-ary Tree Push-Pull'' (BTPP), that employs two B-ary spanning trees for distributing the information related to the parameters and stochastic gradients across the network. The simple method is efficient in communication since each agent interacts with at most $(B+1)$ neighbors per iteration. More importantly, BTPP achieves linear speedup for smooth nonconvex objective functions with only $\tilde{O}(n)$ transient iterations, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art results to the best of our knowledge.

Batched Energy-Entropy acquisition for Bayesian Optimization
Bayesian optimization (BO) is an attractive machine learning framework for performing sample-efficient global optimization of black-box functions. The optimization process is guided by an acquisition function that selects points to acquire in each round of BO. In batched BO, when multiple points are acquired in parallel, commonly used acquisition functions are often high-dimensional and intractable, leading to the use of sampling-based alternatives. We propose a statistical physics inspired acquisition function that can natively handle batches. Batched Energy-Entropy acquisition for BO (BEEBO) enables tight control of the explore-exploit trade-off of the optimization process and generalizes to heteroskedastic black-box problems. We demonstrate the applicability of BEEBO on a range of problems, showing competitive performance to existing acquisition functions.

Bayesian Domain Adaptation with Gaussian Mixture Domain-Indexing
Recent methods are proposed to improve  performance of domain adaptation by inferring domain index under an adversarial variational bayesian framework, where domain index is unavailable. However, existing methods typically assume that all the global domain indices are sampled from a vanilla gaussian prior, overlooking the inherent structures among different domains.To address this challenge, we propose a Bayesian Domain Adaptation with Gaussian Mixture Domain-Indexing(GMDI) algorithm. GMDI employs a Gaussian Mixture Model for domain indices, with the number of component distributions in the ``domain-themes'' space adaptively determined by a Chinese Restaurant Process. By dynamically adjusting the mixtures at the domain indices level, GMDI significantly improves domain adaptation performance. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GMDI achieves a more stringent evidence lower bound, closer to the log-likelihood. For classification, GMDI improves accuracy by at least 63% (from 33.5% to 96.5%), outperforms all methods, and surpasses the state-of-the-art method, VDI, by up to 3.4%, reaching 99.3%. For regression, GMDI reduces MSE by 16.4% (from 2.496 to 2.087) and by 21.1% (from 3.160 to 2.493), achieving the lowest errors among all methods.

Bayesian Nonparametrics Meets Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Optimization
Training machine learning and statistical models often involves optimizing a data-driven risk criterion. The risk is usually computed with respect to the empirical data distribution, but this may result in poor and unstable out-of-sample performance due to distributional uncertainty. In the spirit of distributionally robust optimization, we propose a novel robust criterion by combining insights from Bayesian nonparametric (i.e., Dirichlet process) theory and a recent decision-theoretic model of smooth ambiguity-averse preferences. First, we highlight novel connections with standard regularized empirical risk minimization techniques, among which Ridge and LASSO regressions. Then, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of favorable finite-sample and asymptotic statistical guarantees on the performance of the robust optimization procedure. For practical implementation, we propose and study tractable approximations of the criterion based on well-known Dirichlet process representations. We also show that the smoothness of the criterion naturally leads to standard gradient-based numerical optimization. Finally, we provide insights into the workings of our method by applying it to a variety of tasks based on simulated and real datasets.

Bayesian Online Natural Gradient (BONG)
We propose a novel approach to  sequential Bayesian inference based on variational Bayes.  The key insight is that,  in the online setting,  we do not need to add the KL term to regularize to the prior (which comes from the posterior at the previous timestep);  instead we can optimize just the expected log-likelihood,  performing a single step of natural gradient descent  starting at the prior predictive.  We prove this method recovers exact Bayesian inference   if the model is conjugate,  and empirically outperforms other online VB methods  in the  non-conjugate setting,  such as online learning for neural networks,  especially when controlling for computational costs.

Bayesian Optimisation with Unknown Hyperparameters: Regret Bounds Logarithmically Closer to Optimal
Bayesian Optimization (BO) is widely used for optimising black-box functions but requires us to specify the length scale hyperparameter, which defines the smoothness of the functions the optimizer will consider. Most current BO algorithms choose this hyperparameter by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the observed data, albeit risking misspecification if the objective function is less smooth in regions we have not yet explored. The only prior solution addressing this problem with theoretical guarantees was A-GP-UCB, proposed by Berkenkamp et al. (2019). This algorithm progressively decreases the length scale, expanding the class of functions considered by the optimizer. However, A-GP-UCB lacks a stopping mechanism, leading to over-exploration and slow convergence. To overcome this, we introduce Length scale Balancing (LB) - a novel approach, aggregating multiple base surrogate models with varying length scales. LB intermittently adds smaller length scale candidate values while retaining longer scales, balancing exploration and exploitation. We formally derive a cumulative regret bound of LB and compare it with the regret of an oracle BO algorithm using the optimal length scale. Denoting the factor by which the regret bound of A-GP-UCB was away from oracle as $g(T)$,  we show that LB is only $\log g(T)$ away from oracle regret. We also empirically evaluate our algorithm on synthetic and real-world benchmarks and show it outperforms A-GP-UCB and maximum likelihood estimation.

Bayesian Optimization of Functions over Node Subsets in Graphs
We address the problem of optimizing over functions defined on node subsets in a graph.  The optimization of such functions is often a non-trivial task given their combinatorial, black-box and expensive-to-evaluate nature. Although various algorithms have been introduced in the literature, most are either task-specific or computationally inefficient and only utilize information about the graph structure without considering the characteristics of the function. To address these limitations, we utilize Bayesian Optimization (BO), a sample-efficient black-box solver, and propose a novel framework for combinatorial optimization on graphs. More specifically, we map each $k$-node subset in the original graph to a node in a new combinatorial graph and adopt a local modeling approach to efficiently traverse the latter graph by progressively sampling its subgraphs using a recursive algorithm. Extensive experiments under both synthetic and real-world setups demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BO framework on various types of graphs and optimization tasks, where its behavior is analyzed in detail with ablation studies.

Bayesian Strategic Classification
In strategic classification, agents modify their features, at a cost, to obtain a positive classification outcome from the learner’s classifier, typically assuming agents have full knowledge of the deployed classifier. In contrast, we consider a Bayesian setting where agents have a common distributional prior on the classifier being used and agents manipulate their features to maximize their expected utility according to this prior.The learner can reveal truthful, yet not necessarily complete, information about the classifier to the agents, aiming to release just enough information to shape the agents' behavior and thus maximize accuracy. We show that partial information release can counter-intuitively benefit the learner’s accuracy, allowing qualified agents to pass the classifier while preventing unqualified agents from doing so. Despite the intractability of computing the best response of an agent in the general case, we provide oracle-efficient algorithms for scenarios where the learner’s hypothesis class consists of low-dimensional linear classifiers or when the agents’ cost function satisfies a sub-modularity condition. Additionally, we address the learner’s optimization problem, offering both positive and negative results on determining the optimal information release to maximize expected accuracy, particularly in settings where an agent’s qualification can be represented by a real-valued number.

Bayes-optimal learning of an extensive-width neural network from quadratically many samples
We consider the problem of learning a target function corresponding to a single hidden layer neural network with a quadratic activation function after the first layer and random weights. We consider the asymptotic limit where the input dimension and the network width are proportionally large. Recent work [Cui et al., 2023] established that linear regression provides Bayes-optimal test error to learn such a function when the number of available samples is only linear in the dimension. That work stressed the open challenge of theoretically analyzing the optimal test error in the more interesting regime where the number of samples is quadratic in the dimension. In this paper, we solve this challenge for quadratic activations and derive a closed-form expression for the Bayes-optimal test error. Technically, our result is enabled by establishing a link with recent works on optimal denoising of extensive rank matrices and on the ellipsoid fitting problem. We further show empirically that, in the absence of noise, randomly-initialized gradient descent seems to sample the space of weights, leading to zero training loss, and averaging over initialization leads to a test error equal to the Bayes-optimal one.

B-cosification: Transforming Deep Neural Networks to be Inherently Interpretable
Understanding the decisions of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a challenging task due to their ‘black-box’ nature. Methods such as feature attributions that attempt to explain the decisions of such models post-hoc, while popular, have been shown to often yield explanations that are not faithful to the model. Recently, B-cos networks were proposed as a means of instead designing such networks to be inherently interpretable by architecturally enforcing stronger alignment between inputs and weights, yielding highly human interpretable explanations that are model-faithful by design. However, unlike with post-hoc methods, this requires training new models from scratch, which represents a major hurdle for establishing such novel models as an alternative to existing ones, in particular due to the increasing reliance on large, pre-trained foundational models. In this work, inspired by the architectural similarities in standard DNNs and B-cos networks, we propose ‘B-cosification’, a novel approach to transform existing pre-trained models to become inherently interpretable. We perform a thorough study of design choices to perform this conversion, both for convolutional neural networks and vision transformers. We find that B-cosification can yield models that are on par with B-cos models trained from scratch in terms of interpretability, while often outperforming them in terms of classification performance at a fraction of the training cost. Subsequently, we apply B-cosification to CLIP models, and show that, even with limited data and compute cost, we obtain B-cosified CLIP models that are highly interpretable and are competitive on zero shot performance across a variety of datasets.

BECAUSE: Bilinear Causal Representation for Generalizable Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning
Offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) enhances data efficiency by utilizing pre-collected datasets to learn models and policies, especially in scenarios where exploration is costly or infeasible. Nevertheless, its performance often suffers from the objective mismatch between model and policy learning, resulting in inferior performance despite accurate model predictions. This paper first identifies the primary source of this mismatch comes from the underlying confounders present in offline data for MBRL. Subsequently, we introduce **B**ilin**E**ar **CAUS**al r**E**presentation (BECAUSE), an algorithm to capture causal representation for both states and actions to reduce the influence of the distribution shift, thus mitigating the objective mismatch problem. Comprehensive evaluations on 18 tasks that vary in data quality and environment context demonstrate the superior performance of BECAUSE over existing offline RL algorithms. We show the generalizability and robustness of BECAUSE under fewer samples or larger numbers of confounders. Additionally, we offer theoretical analysis of BECAUSE to prove its error bound and sample efficiency when integrating causal representation into offline MBRL.

Be Confident in What You Know: Bayesian Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models
Large transformer-based foundation models have been commonly used as pre-trained models that can be adapted to different challenging datasets and settings with state-of-the-art generalization performance. Parameter efficient fine-tuning ($\texttt{PEFT}$) provides promising generalization performance in adaptation while incurring minimum computational overhead. However, adaptation of these foundation models through $\texttt{PEFT}$ leads to accurate but severely underconfident models, especially in few-shot learning settings. Moreover, the adapted models lack accurate fine-grained uncertainty quantification capabilities limiting their broader applicability in critical domains. To fill out this critical gap, we develop a novel lightweight {Bayesian Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning} (referred to as $\texttt{Bayesian-PEFT}$) framework for large transformer-based foundation models. The framework integrates state-of-the-art $\texttt{PEFT}$ techniques with two Bayesian components to address the under-confidence issue while ensuring reliable prediction under challenging few-shot settings. The first component performs base rate adjustment to strengthen the prior belief corresponding to the knowledge gained through pre-training, making the model more confident in its predictions; the second component builds an evidential ensemble that leverages belief regularization to ensure diversity among different ensemble components.Our thorough theoretical analysis justifies that the  Bayesian components can ensure reliable and accurate few-shot adaptations with well-calibrated uncertainty quantification. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, few-shot learning scenarios, and multiple $\texttt{PEFT}$ techniques demonstrate the outstanding prediction and calibration performance by $\texttt{Bayesian-PEFT}$.

Belief-State Query Policies for Planning With Preferences Under Partial Observability
Planning in real-world settings often entails addressing partial observability while aligning with users' preferences. We present a novel framework for expressing users' preferences about agent behavior in a partially observable setting using parameterized belief-state query (BSQ) preferences in the setting of goal-oriented partially observable Markov decision processes (gPOMDPs). We present the first formal analysis of such preferences and prove that while the expected value of a BSQ preference is not a convex function w.r.t its parameters, it is piecewise constant and yields an implicit discrete parameter search space that is finite for finite horizons. This theoretical result leads to novel algorithms that optimize gPOMDP agent behavior while guaranteeing user preference compliance. Theoretical analysis proves that our algorithms converge to the optimal preference-compliant behavior in the limit. Empirical results show that BSQ preferences provide a computationally feasible approach for planning with preferences in partially observable settings.

BELM: Bidirectional Explicit Linear Multi-step Sampler for Exact Inversion in Diffusion Models
The inversion of diffusion model sampling, which aims to find the corresponding initial noise of a sample, plays a critical role in various tasks.Recently, several heuristic exact inversion samplers have been proposed to address the inexact inversion issue in a training-free manner. However, the theoretical properties of these heuristic samplers remain unknown and they often exhibit mediocre sampling quality.In this paper, we introduce a generic formulation, \emph{Bidirectional Explicit Linear Multi-step} (BELM) samplers, of the exact inversion samplers, which includes all previously proposed heuristic exact inversion samplers as special cases.The BELM formulation is derived from the variable-stepsize-variable-formula linear multi-step method via integrating a bidirectional explicit constraint. We highlight this bidirectional explicit constraint is the key of mathematically exact inversion.We systematically investigate the Local Truncation Error (LTE) within the BELM framework and show that the existing heuristic designs of exact inversion samplers yield sub-optimal LTE.Consequently, we propose the Optimal BELM (O-BELM) sampler through the LTE minimization approach.We conduct additional analysis to substantiate the theoretical stability and global convergence property of the proposed optimal sampler.Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our O-BELM sampler establishes the exact inversion property while achieving high-quality sampling.Additional experiments in image editing and image interpolation highlight the extensive  potential of applying O-BELM in varying applications.

Bench2Drive: Towards Multi-Ability Benchmarking of Closed-Loop End-To-End Autonomous Driving
In an era marked by the rapid scaling of foundation models, autonomous driving technologies are approaching a transformative threshold where end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) emerges due to its potential of scaling up in the data-driven manner. However, existing E2E-AD methods are mostly evaluated under the open-loop log-replay manner with L2 errors and collision rate as metrics (e.g., in nuScenes), which could not fully reflect the driving performance of algorithms as recently acknowledged in the community. For those E2E-AD methods evaluated under the closed-loop protocol, they are tested in fixed routes (e.g., Town05Long and Longest6 in CARLA) with the driving score as metrics, which is known for high variance due to the unsmoothed metric function and large randomness in the long route. Besides, these methods usually collect their own data for training, which makes algorithm-level fair comparison infeasible.    To fulfill the paramount need of comprehensive, realistic, and fair testing environments for Full Self-Driving (FSD), we present Bench2Drive, the first benchmark for evaluating E2E-AD systems' multiple abilities in a closed-loop manner. Bench2Drive's official training data consists of 2 million fully annotated frames, collected from 10000 short clips uniformly distributed under 44 interactive scenarios (cut-in, overtaking, detour, etc), 23 weathers (sunny, foggy, rainy, etc), and 12 towns (urban, village, university, etc) in CARLA v2. Its evaluation protocol requires E2E-AD models to pass 44 interactive scenarios under different locations and weathers which sums up to 220 routes and thus provides a comprehensive and disentangled assessment about their driving capability under different situations. We implement state-of-the-art E2E-AD models and evaluate them in Bench2Drive, providing insights regarding current status and future directions.

Benchmarking Estimators for Natural Experiments: A Novel Dataset and a Doubly Robust Algorithm
Estimating the effect of treatments from natural experiments, where treatments are pre-assigned, is an important and well-studied problem. We introduce a novel natural experiment dataset obtained from an early childhood literacy nonprofit. Surprisingly, applying over 20 established estimators to the dataset produces inconsistent results in evaluating the nonprofits efficacy. To address this, we create a benchmark to evaluate estimator accuracy using synthetic outcomes, whose design was guided by domain experts. The benchmark extensively explores performance as real world conditions like sample size, treatment correlation, and propensity score accuracy vary. Based on our benchmark, we observe that the class of doubly robust treatment effect estimators, which are based on simple and intuitive regression adjustment, generally outperform other more complicated estimators by orders of magnitude. To better support our theoretical understanding of doubly robust estimators, we derive a closed form expression for the variance of any such estimator that uses dataset splitting to obtain an unbiased estimate. This expression motivates the design of a new doubly robust estimator that uses a novel loss function when fitting functions for regression adjustment. We release the dataset and benchmark in a Python package; the package is built in a modular way to facilitate new datasets and estimators. https://github.com/rtealwitter/naturalexperiments

Benchmarking Generative Models on Computational Thinking Tests in Elementary Visual Programming
Generative models have demonstrated human-level proficiency in various benchmarks across domains like programming, natural sciences, and general knowledge. Despite these promising results on competitive benchmarks, they still struggle with seemingly simple problem-solving tasks typically carried out by elementary-level students. How do state-of-the-art models perform on standardized tests designed to assess computational thinking and problem-solving skills at schools? In this paper, we curate a novel benchmark involving computational thinking tests grounded in elementary visual programming domains. Our initial results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Llama3 barely match the performance of an average school student. To further boost the performance of these models, we fine-tune them using a novel synthetic data generation methodology. The key idea is to develop a comprehensive dataset using symbolic methods that capture different skill levels, ranging from recognition of visual elements to multi-choice quizzes to synthesis-style tasks. We showcase how various aspects of symbolic information in synthetic data help improve fine-tuned models' performance. We will release the full implementation and datasets to facilitate further research on enhancing computational thinking in generative models.

Benchmarking Out-of-Distribution Generalization and Adaptation for Electromyography
This paper introduces the first generalization and adaptation benchmark using machine learning for evaluating out-of-distribution performance of electromyography (EMG) classification algorithms. The ability of an EMG classifier to handle inputs drawn from a different distribution than the training distribution is critical for real-world deployment as a control interface. By predicting the user’s intended gesture using EMG signals, we can create a wearable solution to control assistive technologies, such as computers, prosthetics, and mobile manipulator robots. This new out-of-distribution benchmark consists of two major tasks that have utility for building robust and adaptable control interfaces: 1) intersubject classification, and 2) adaptation using train-test splits for time-series. This benchmark spans six datasets, the largest collection of EMG datasets in a benchmark. Among these, a new dataset is introduced, featuring a novel, easy-to-wear high-density EMG wearable for data collection. The lack of open-source benchmarks has made comparing accuracy results between papers challenging for the EMG research community. This new benchmark provides researchers with a valuable resource for analyzing practical measures of out-of-distribution performance for EMG datasets. Our code and data from our new dataset can be found at emgbench.github.io.

Benchmarking the Reasoning Robustness against Noisy Rationales in Chain-of-thought Prompting
This paper investigates an under-explored challenge in large language models (LLMs): chain-of-thought prompting with noisy rationales—irrelevant or inaccurate reasoning steps—despite advancements in in-context learning. We construct the NoRa dataset, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs’ robustness to noisy rationales, based on which we reveal a widespread vulnerability among LLMs to such noise, with limited efficacy from existing reasoning methods. To combat this, we propose the contrastive denoising with noisy chain-of-thought (CD-CoT) method to enhance denoising-reasoning capabilities by contrasting noisy rationales with only one clean rationale, thereby advancing the robustness of LLMs in reasoning.

BenchX: A Unified Benchmark Framework for Medical Vision-Language Pretraining on Chest X-Rays
Medical Vision-Language Pretraining (MedVLP) shows promise in learning generalizable and transferable visual representations from paired and unpaired medical images and reports. MedVLP can provide useful features to downstream tasks and facilitate adapting task-specific models to new setups using fewer examples. However, existing MedVLP methods often differ in terms of datasets, preprocessing, and finetuning implementations. This pose great challenges in evaluating how well a MedVLP method generalizes to various clinically-relevant tasks due to the lack of unified, standardized, and comprehensive benchmark. To fill this gap, we propose BenchX, a unified benchmark framework that enables head-to-head comparison and systematical analysis between MedVLP methods using public chest X-ray datasets. Specifically, BenchX is composed of three components: 1) Comprehensive datasets covering nine datasets and four medical tasks; 2) Benchmark suites to standardize data preprocessing, train-test splits, and parameter selection; 3) Unified finetuning protocols that accommodate heterogeneous MedVLP methods for consistent task adaptation in classification, segmentation, and report generation, respectively. Utilizing BenchX, we establish baselines for nine state-of-the-art MedVLP methods and found that the performance of some early MedVLP methods can be enhanced to surpass more recent ones, prompting a revisiting of the developments and conclusions from prior works in MedVLP.

Benign overfitting in leaky ReLU networks with moderate input dimension
The problem of benign overfitting asks whether it is possible for a model to perfectly fit noisy training data and still generalize well. We study benign overfitting in two-layer leaky ReLU networks trained with the hinge loss on a binary classification task. We consider input data which can be decomposed into the sum of a common signal and a random noise component, which lie on subspaces orthogonal to one another. We characterize conditions on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the model parameters giving rise to benign versus non-benign, or harmful, overfitting: in particular, if the SNR is high then benign overfitting occurs, conversely if the SNR is low then harmful overfitting occurs. We attribute both benign and non-benign overfitting to an approximate margin maximization property and show that leaky ReLU networks trained on hinge loss with gradient descent (GD) satisfy this property. In contrast to prior work we do not require the training data to be nearly orthogonal. Notably, for input dimension $d$ and training sample size $n$, while results in prior work require $d = \Omega(n^2 \log n)$, here we require only $d = \Omega(n)$.

Better by default: Strong pre-tuned MLPs and boosted trees on tabular data
For classification and regression on tabular data, the dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) has recently been challenged by often much slower deep learning methods with extensive hyperparameter tuning. We address this discrepancy by (a) introducing RealMLP, an improved multilayer perceptron (MLP), and (b) improved default parameters for GBDTs and RealMLP.We tune RealMLP and the default parameters on a meta-train benchmark with 71 classification and 47 regression datasets and compare them to hyperparameter-optimized versions on a disjoint meta-test benchmark with 48 classification and 42 regression datasets, as well as the GBDT-friendly benchmark by Grinsztajn et al. (2022). Our benchmark results show that RealMLP offers a better time-accuracy tradeoff than other neural nets and is competitive with GBDTs. Moreover, a combination of RealMLP and GBDTs with improved default parameters can achieve excellent results on medium-sized tabular datasets (1K--500K samples) without hyperparameter tuning.

BetterDepth: Plug-and-Play Diffusion Refiner for Zero-Shot Monocular Depth Estimation
By training over large-scale datasets, zero-shot monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods show robust performance in the wild but often suffer from insufficiently precise details. Although recent diffusion-based MDE approaches exhibit appealing detail extraction ability, they still struggle in geometrically challenging scenes due to the difficulty of gaining robust geometric priors from diverse datasets. To leverage the complementary merits of both worlds, we propose BetterDepth to efficiently achieve geometrically correct affine-invariant MDE performance while capturing fine-grained details. Specifically, BetterDepth is a conditional diffusion-based refiner that takes the prediction from pre-trained MDE models as depth conditioning, in which the global depth context is well-captured, and iteratively refines details based on the input image. For the training of such a refiner, we propose global pre-alignment and local patch masking methods to ensure the faithfulness of BetterDepth to depth conditioning while learning to capture fine-grained scene details. By efficient training on small-scale synthetic datasets, BetterDepth achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot MDE performance on diverse public datasets and in-the-wild scenes. Moreover, BetterDepth can improve the performance of other MDE models in a plug-and-play manner without additional re-training.

Beware of Road Markings: A New Adversarial Patch Attack to Monocular Depth Estimation
Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) enables the prediction of scene depths from a single RGB image, having been widely integrated into production-grade autonomous driving systems, e.g., Tesla Autopilot. Current adversarial attacks to MDE models focus on attaching an optimized adversarial patch to a designated obstacle. Although effective, this approach presents two inherent limitations: its reliance on specific obstacles and its limited malicious impact. In contrast, we propose a pioneering attack to MDE models that \textit{decouples obstacles from patches physically and deploys optimized patches on roads}, thereby extending the attack scope to arbitrary traffic participants. This approach is inspired by our groundbreaking discovery: \textit{various MDE models with different architectures, trained for autonomous driving, heavily rely on road regions} when predicting depths for different obstacles. Based on this discovery, we design the Adversarial Road Marking (AdvRM) attack, which camouflages patches as ordinary road markings and deploys them on roads, thereby posing a continuous threat within the environment. Experimental results from both dataset simulations and real-world scenarios demonstrate that AdvRM is effective, stealthy, and robust against various MDE models, achieving about 1.507 of Mean Relative Shift Ratio (MRSR) over 8 MDE models. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/a-c-a-c/AdvRM.git}

Beyond Concept Bottleneck Models: How to Make Black Boxes Intervenable?
Recently, interpretable machine learning has re-explored concept bottleneck models (CBM). An advantage of this model class is the user's ability to intervene on predicted concept values, affecting the downstream output. In this work, we introduce a method to perform such concept-based interventions on *pretrained* neural networks, which are not interpretable by design, only given a small validation set with concept labels. Furthermore, we formalise the notion of *intervenability* as a measure of the effectiveness of concept-based interventions and leverage this definition to fine-tune black boxes. Empirically, we explore the intervenability of black-box classifiers on synthetic tabular and natural image benchmarks. We focus on backbone architectures of varying complexity, from simple, fully connected neural nets to Stable Diffusion. We demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning improves intervention effectiveness and often yields better-calibrated predictions. To showcase the practical utility of our techniques, we apply them to deep chest X-ray classifiers and show that fine-tuned black boxes are more intervenable than CBMs. Lastly, we establish that our methods are still effective under vision-language-model-based concept annotations, alleviating the need for a human-annotated validation set.

Beyond Redundancy: Information-aware Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Structure Learning
Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Learning (UMGL) aims to learn node representations on diverse edge types without manual labeling. However, existing research overlooks a key factor: the reliability of the graph structure. Real-world data often exhibit a complex nature and contain abundant task-irrelevant noise, severely compromising UMGL's performance. Moreover, existing methods primarily rely on contrastive learning to maximize mutual information across different graphs, limiting them to multiplex graph redundant scenarios and failing to capture view-unique task-relevant information. In this paper, we focus on a more realistic and challenging task: to unsupervisedly learn a fused graph from multiple graph that preserves sufficient task-relevant information while removing task-irrelevant noise. Specifically, our proposed Information-aware Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Fusion framework (InfoMGF) uses graph structure refinement to eliminate irrelevant noise and simultaneously maximizes view-shared and view-unique task-relevant information, thereby tackling the frontier of non-redundant multiplex graph. Theoretical analyses further guarantee the effectiveness of InfoMGF. Comprehensive experiments against various baselines on different downstream tasks demonstrate its superior performance and robustness. Surprisingly, our unsupervised method even beats sophisticated supervised approaches.

Beyond Single Stationary Policies: Meta-Task Players as Naturally Superior Collaborators
In human-AI collaborative tasks, the distribution of human behavior, influenced by mental models, is non-stationary, manifesting in various levels of initiative and different collaborative strategies. A significant challenge in human-AI collaboration is determining how to collaborate effectively with humans exhibiting non-stationary dynamics. Current collaborative agents involve initially running self-play (SP) multiple times to build a policy pool, followed by training the final adaptive policy against this pool. These agents themselves are a single policy network, which is $\textbf{insufficient for handling non-stationary human dynamics}$. We discern that despite the inherent diversity in human behaviors, the $\textbf{underlying meta-tasks within specific collaborative contexts tend to be strikingly similar}$. Accordingly, we propose a $\textbf{C}$ollaborative $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{R}$euse ($\textbf{CBPR}$), a novel Bayesian-based framework that $\textbf{adaptively selects optimal collaborative policies matching the current meta-task from multiple policy networks}$ instead of just selecting actions relying on a single policy network. We provide theoretical guarantees for CBPR's rapid convergence to the optimal policy once human partners alter their policies. This framework shifts from directly modeling human behavior to identifying various meta-tasks that support human decision-making and training meta-task playing (MTP) agents tailored to enhance collaboration. Our method undergoes rigorous testing in a well-recognized collaborative cooking simulator, $\textit{Overcooked}$. Both empirical results and user studies demonstrate CBPR's superior competitiveness compared to existing baselines.

Beyond Slow Signs in High-fidelity Model Extraction
Deep neural networks, costly to train and rich in intellectual property value, areincreasingly threatened by model extraction attacks that compromise their confiden-tiality. Previous attacks have succeeded in reverse-engineering model parametersup to a precision of float64 for models trained on random data with at most threehidden layers using cryptanalytical techniques. However, the process was identifiedto be very time consuming and not feasible for larger and deeper models trained onstandard benchmarks. Our study evaluates the feasibility of parameter extractionmethods of Carlini et al. [1] further enhanced by Canales-Martínez et al. [2] formodels trained on standard benchmarks. We introduce a unified codebase thatintegrates previous methods and reveal that computational tools can significantlyinfluence performance. We develop further optimisations to the end-to-end attackand improve the efficiency of extracting weight signs by up to 14.8 times com-pared to former methods through the identification of easier and harder to extractneurons. Contrary to prior assumptions, we identify extraction of weights, notextraction of weight signs, as the critical bottleneck. With our improvements, a16,721 parameter model with 2 hidden layers trained on MNIST is extracted withinonly 98 minutes compared to at least 150 minutes previously. Finally, addressingmethodological deficiencies observed in previous studies, we propose new ways ofrobust benchmarking for future model extraction attacks.

Beyond the Doors of Perception: Vision Transformers Represent Relations Between Objects
Though vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of settings, they exhibit surprising failures when performing tasks involving visual relations. This begs the question: how do ViTs attempt to perform tasks that require computing visual relations between objects? Prior efforts to interpret ViTs tend to focus on characterizing relevant low-level visual features. In contrast, we adopt methods from mechanistic interpretability to study the higher-level visual algorithms that ViTs use to perform abstract visual reasoning. We present a case study of a fundamental, yet surprisingly difficult, relational reasoning task: judging whether two visual entities are the same or different. We find that pretrained ViTs fine-tuned on this task often exhibit two qualitatively different stages of processing despite having no obvious inductive biases to do so: 1) a perceptual stage wherein local object features are extracted and stored in a disentangled representation, and 2) a relational stage wherein object representations are compared. In the second stage, we find evidence that ViTs can learn to represent somewhat abstract visual relations, a capability that has long been considered out of reach for artificial neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate that failure points at either stage can prevent a model from learning a generalizable solution to our fairly simple tasks. By understanding ViTs in terms of discrete processing stages, one can more precisely diagnose and rectify shortcomings of existing and future models.

Bias in Motion: Theoretical Insights into the Dynamics of Bias in SGD Training
Machine learning systems often acquire biases by leveraging undesired features in the data, impacting accuracy variably across different sub-populations of the data. However, our current understanding of bias formation mostly focuses on the initial and final stages of learning, leaving a gap in knowledge regarding the transient dynamics. To address this gap, this paper explores the evolution of bias in a teacher-student setup that models different data sub-populations with a Gaussian-mixture model. We provide an analytical description of the stochastic gradient descent dynamics of a linear classifier in this setup, which we prove to be exact in high dimension.Notably, our analysis identifies different properties of the sub-populations that drive bias at different timescales and hence shows a shifting preference of our classifier during training. By applying our general solution to fairness and robustness, we delineate how and when heterogeneous data and spurious features can generate and amplify bias. We empirically validate our results in more complex scenarios by training deeper networks on synthetic and real data, i.e. using CIFAR10, MNIST, and CelebA datasets.

BiDM: Pushing the Limit of Quantization for Diffusion Models
Diffusion models (DMs) have been significantly developed and widely used in various applications due to their excellent generative qualities. However, the expensive computation and massive parameters of DMs hinder their practical use in resource-constrained scenarios. As one of the effective compression approaches, quantization allows DMs to achieve storage saving and inference acceleration by reducing bit-width while maintaining generation performance.  However, as the most extreme quantization form, 1-bit binarization causes the generation performance of DMs to face severe degradation or even collapse. This paper proposes a novel method, namely BiDM, for fully binarizing weights and activations of DMs, pushing quantization to the 1-bit limit. From a temporal perspective, we introduce the Timestep-friendly Binary Structure (TBS), which uses learnable activation binarizers and cross-timestep feature connections to address the highly timestep-correlated activation features of DMs. From a spatial perspective, we propose Space Patched Distillation (SPD) to address the difficulty of matching binary features during distillation, focusing on the spatial locality of image generation tasks and noise estimation networks. As the first work to fully binarize DMs, the W1A1 BiDM on the LDM-4 model for LSUN-Bedrooms 256$\times$256 achieves a remarkable FID of 22.74, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art general binarization methods with an FID of 59.44 and invalid generative samples, and achieves up to excellent 28.0 times storage and 52.7 times OPs savings.

Binarized Diffusion Model for Image Super-Resolution
Advanced diffusion models (DMs) perform impressively in image super-resolution (SR), but the high memory and computational costs hinder their deployment. Binarization, an ultra-compression algorithm, offers the potential for effectively accelerating DMs. Nonetheless, due to the model structure and the multi-step iterative attribute of DMs, existing binarization methods result in significant performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce a novel binarized diffusion model, BI-DiffSR, for image SR. First, for the model structure, we design a UNet architecture optimized for binarization. We propose the consistent-pixel-downsample (CP-Down) and consistent-pixel-upsample (CP-Up) to maintain dimension consistent and facilitate the full-precision information transfer. Meanwhile, we design the channel-shuffle-fusion (CS-Fusion) to enhance feature fusion in skip connection. Second, for the activation difference across timestep, we design the timestep-aware redistribution (TaR) and activation function (TaA). The TaR and TaA dynamically adjust the distribution of activations based on different timesteps, improving the flexibility and representation alability of the binarized module. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our BI-DiffSR outperforms existing binarization methods. Code and pre-trained models will be released.

Binary Search Tree with Distributional Predictions
Algorithms with (machine-learned) predictions is a powerful framework for combining traditional worst-case algorithms with modern machine learning.  However, the vast majority of work in this space assumes that the prediction itself is non-probabilistic, even if it is generated by some stochastic process (such as a machine learning system).  This is a poor fit for modern ML, particularly modern neural networks, which naturally generate a *distribution*.  We initiate the study of algorithms with *distributional* predictions, where the prediction itself is a distribution.  We focus on one of the simplest yet  fundamental settings: binary search trees (or searching a sorted array).  This setting has one of the simplest algorithms with a point prediction, but what happens if the prediction is a distribution?  We show that this is a richer setting: there are simple distributions where using the classical prediction-based algorithm with any single prediction does poorly.  Motivated by this, as our main result, we give an algorithm with query running time $O(H(p) + \log \eta)$, where $H(p)$ is the entropy of the true distribution $p$ and $\eta$ is the Earth Mover's distance between $p$ and the predicted distribution $\hat p$.  We complement this with a lower bound showing that this running time is essentially optimal (up to constants), and experiments validating the practical usefulness of our algorithm.

Binding in hippocampal-entorhinal circuits enables compositionality in cognitive maps
We propose a normative model for spatial representation in the hippocampal formation that combines optimality principles, such as maximizing coding range and spatial information per neuron, with an algebraic framework for computing in distributed representation. Spatial position is encoded in a residue number system, with individual residues represented by high-dimensional, complex-valued vectors. These are composed into a single vector representing position by a similarity-preserving, conjunctive vector-binding operation. Self-consistency between the vectors representing position and the individual residues is enforced by a modular attractor network whose modules correspond to the grid cell modules in entorhinal cortex. The vector binding operation can also be used to bind different contexts to spatial representations, yielding a model for entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. We provide model analysis of scaling, similarity preservation and convergence behavior as well as experiments demonstrating noise robustness, sub-integer resolution in representing position, and path integration. The model formalizes the computations in the cognitive map and makes testable experimental predictions.

Biomedical Visual Instruction Tuning with Clinician Preference Alignment
Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have showcased impressive capabilities in understanding and reasoning with visual and textual information. Adapting these foundation models trained for general usage to specialized domains like biomedicine requires large-scale domain-specific instruction datasets. While existing works have explored curating such datasets automatically, the resultant datasets are not explicitly aligned with domain expertise. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework, Biomedical Visual Instruction Tuning with Clinician Preference Alignment (BioMed-VITAL), that incorporates clinician preferences into both stages of generating and selecting instruction data for tuning biomedical multimodal foundation models. First, during the generation stage, we prompt the GPT-4V generator with a diverse set of clinician-selected demonstrations for preference-aligned data candidate generation. Then, during the selection phase, we train a separate selection model, which explicitly distills clinician and policy-guided model preferences into a rating function to select high-quality data for medical instruction tuning. Results show that the model tuned with the instruction-following data from our method demonstrates a significant improvement in open visual chat (18.5% relatively) and medical VQA (win rate up to 81.73%). Our instruction-following data and models are available at https://BioMed-VITAL.github.io.

BitsFusion: 1.99 bits Weight Quantization of Diffusion Model
Diffusion-based image generation models have achieved great success in recent years by showing the capability of synthesizing high-quality content. However, these models contain a huge number of parameters, resulting in a significantly large model size. Saving and transferring them is a major bottleneck for various applications, especially those running on resource-constrained devices. In this work, we develop a novel weight quantization method that quantizes the UNet from Stable Diffusion v1.5 to $1.99$ bits, achieving a model with $7.9\times$ smaller size while exhibiting even better generation quality than the original one. Our approach includes several novel techniques, such as assigning optimal bits to each layer, initializing the quantized model for better performance, and improving the training strategy to dramatically reduce quantization error. Furthermore, we extensively evaluate our quantized model across various benchmark datasets and through human evaluation to demonstrate its superior generation quality.

BiVLC: Extending Vision-Language Compositionality Evaluation with Text-to-Image Retrieval
Existing Vision-Language Compositionality (VLC) benchmarks like SugarCrepe are formulated as image-to-text retrieval problems, where, given an image, the models need to select between the correct textual description and a synthetic hard negative text. In this work we present the Bidirectional Vision-Language Compositionality (BiVLC) dataset. The novelty of BiVLC is to add a synthetic hard negative image generated from the synthetic text, resulting in two image-to-text retrieval examples (one for each image) and, more importantly, two text-to-image retrieval examples (one for each text). Human annotators filter out ill-formed examples ensuring the validity of the benchmark. The experiments on BiVLC uncover a weakness of current multimodal models, as they perform poorly in the text-to-image direction. In fact, when considering both retrieval directions, the conclusions obtained in previous works change significantly. In addition to the benchmark, we show that a contrastive model trained using synthetic images and texts improves the state of the art in SugarCrepe and in BiVLC for both retrieval directions. The gap to human performance in BiVLC confirms that Vision-Language Compositionality is still a challenging problem. BiVLC and code are available at https://imirandam.github.io/BiVLC_project_page.

Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion
Recently, various methods have been proposed to solve Image Restoration (IR) tasks using a pre-trained diffusion model leading to state-of-the-art performance. However, most of these methods assume that the degradation operator in the IR task is completely known. Furthermore, a common characteristic among these approaches is that they alter the diffusion sampling process in order to satisfy the consistency with the degraded input image. This choice has recently been shown to be sub-optimal and to cause the restored image to deviate from the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, \ie, not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the  input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the  computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them.

Block Sparse Bayesian Learning: A Diversified Scheme
This paper introduces a novel prior called Diversified Block Sparse Prior to characterize the widespread block sparsity phenomenon in real-world data. By allowing diversification on intra-block variance and inter-block correlation matrices, we effectively address the sensitivity issue of existing block sparse  learning methods to pre-defined block information, which enables adaptive block estimation while mitigating the risk of overfitting. Based on this, a diversified block sparse Bayesian learning method (DivSBL) is proposed, utilizing EM algorithm and dual ascent method for hyperparameter estimation. Moreover, we establish the global and local optimality theory of our model. Experiments validate the advantages of DivSBL over existing algorithms.

BMRS: Bayesian Model Reduction for Structured Pruning
Modern neural networks are often massively overparameterized leading to high compute costs during training and at inference. One effective method to improve both the compute and energy efficiency of neural networks while maintaining good performance is structured pruning, where full network structures (e.g. neurons or convolutional filters) that have limited impact on the model output are removed. In this work, we propose Bayesian Model Reduction for Structured pruning (BMRS), a fully end-to-end Bayesian method of structured pruning. BMRS is based on two recent methods: Bayesian structured pruning with multiplicative noise, and Bayesian model reduction (BMR), a method which allows efficient comparison of Bayesian models under a change in prior. We present two realizations of BMRS derived from different priors which yield different structured pruning characteristics:  1) BMRS_N with the truncated log-normal prior, which offers reliable compression rates and accuracy without the need for tuning any thresholds and 2) BMRS_U with the truncated log-uniform prior that can achieve more aggressive compression based on the boundaries of truncation. Overall, we find that BMRS offers a theoretically grounded approach to structured pruning of neural networks yielding both high compression rates and accuracy. Experiments on multiple datasets and neural networks of varying complexity showed that the two BMRS methods offer a competitive performance-efficiency trade-off compared to other pruning methods.

Boosting Alignment for Post-Unlearning Text-to-Image Generative Models
Large-scale generative models have shown impressive image-generation capabilities, propelled by massive data. However, this often inadvertently leads to the generation of harmful or inappropriate content and raises copyright concerns. Driven by these concerns, machine unlearning has become crucial to effectively purge undesirable knowledge from models. While existing literature has studied various unlearning techniques, these often suffer from either the quality of unlearning or the degradation in text-image alignment after unlearning due to the competitive nature of these objectives. To address these challenges, we first propose a framework that seeks an optimal model update at each unlearning iteration, ensuring monotonic improvement on both objectives and further derive the characterization of such an update.   In addition, we design procedures to strategically diversify the unlearning and remaining datasets to boost performance improvement. Our evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively removes diverse target classes from recent diffusion-based generative models and concepts from stable diffusion models, while maintaining close alignment with the models' original trained states, thus outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Boosting Graph Pooling with Persistent Homology
Recently, there has been an emerging trend to integrate persistent homology (PH) into graph neural networks (GNNs) to enrich expressive power. However, naively plugging PH features into GNN layers always results in marginal improvement with low interpretability. In this paper, we investigate a novel mechanism for injecting global topological invariance into pooling layers using PH, motivated by the observation that filtration operation in PH naturally aligns graph pooling in a cut-off manner. In this fashion, message passing in the coarsened graph acts along persistent pooled topology, leading to improved performance. Experimentally, we apply our mechanism to a collection of graph pooling methods and observe consistent and substantial performance gain over several popular datasets, demonstrating its wide applicability and flexibility.

Boosting Sample Efficiency and Generalization in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning via Equivariance
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) struggles with sample inefficiency and poor generalization . These challenges are partially due to a lack of structure or inductive bias in the neural networks typically used in learning the policy. One such form of structure that is commonly observed in multi-agent scenarios is symmetry. The field of Geometric Deep Learning has developed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) that are equivariant (or symmetric) to rotations, translations, and reflections of nodes. Incorporating equivariance has been shown to improve learning efficiency and decrease error . In this paper, we demonstrate that  EGNNs improve the sample efficiency and generalization in MARL. However, we also show that a naive application of  EGNNs to MARL  results in poor early exploration due to a bias in the EGNN structure. To mitigate this bias, we present \textit{Exploration-enhanced Equivariant Graph Neural Networks} or E2GN2. We compare E2GN2 to other common function approximators using common MARL benchmarks MPE and SMACv2. E2GN2 demonstrates up to 10x improvement in sample efficiency, greater final reward convergence, and up to 5x gain in generalization over standard GNNs. These results pave the way for more reliable and effective solutions in complex multi-agent systems.

Boosting Semi-Supervised Scene Text Recognition via Viewing and Summarizing
Existing scene text recognition (STR) methods struggle to recognize challenging texts, especially for artistic and severely distorted characters. The limitation lies in the insufficient exploration of character morphologies, including the monotonousness of widely used synthetic training data and the sensitivity of the model to character morphologies. To address these issues, inspired by the human learning process of viewing and summarizing, we facilitate the contrastive learning-based STR framework in a self-motivated manner by leveraging synthetic and real unlabeled data without any human cost. In the viewing process, to compensate for the simplicity of synthetic data and enrich character morphology diversity, we propose an Online Generation Strategy to generate background-free samples with diverse character styles. By excluding background noise distractions, the model is encouraged to focus on character morphology and generalize the ability to recognize complex samples when trained with only simple synthetic data. To boost the summarizing process, we theoretically demonstrate the derivation error in the previous character contrastive loss, which mistakenly causes the sparsity in the intra-class distribution and exacerbates ambiguity on challenging samples. Therefore, a new Character Unidirectional Alignment Loss is proposed to correct this error and unify the representation of the same characters in all samples by aligning the character features in the student model with the reference features in the teacher model. Extensive experiment results show that our method achieves SOTA performance (94.7\% and 70.9\% average accuracy on common benchmarks and Union14M-Benchmark). Code will be available.

Bootstrapping Top-down Information for Self-modulating Slot Attention
Object-centric learning (OCL) aims to learn representations of individual objects within visual scenes without manual supervision, facilitating efficient and effective visual reasoning. Traditional OCL methods primarily employ bottom-up approaches that aggregate homogeneous visual features to represent objects. However, in complex visual environments, these methods often fall short due to the heterogeneous nature of visual features within an object. To address this, we propose a novel OCL framework incorporating a top-down pathway. This pathway first bootstraps the semantics of individual objects and then modulates the model to prioritize features relevant to these semantics. By dynamically modulating the model based on its own output, our top-down pathway enhances the representational quality of objects. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple synthetic and real-world object-discovery benchmarks.

Boundary Decomposition for Nadir Objective Vector Estimation
The nadir objective vector plays a key role in solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), where it is often used to normalize the objective space and guide the search. The current methods for estimating the nadir objective vector perform effectively only on specific MOPs. This paper reveals the limitations of these methods: exact methods can only work on discrete MOPs, while heuristic methods cannot deal with the MOP with a complicated feasible objective region. To fill this gap, we propose a general and rigorous method, namely boundary decomposition for nadir objective vector estimation (BDNE). BDNE scalarizes the MOP into a set of boundary subproblems. By utilizing bilevel optimization, boundary subproblems are optimized and adjusted alternately, thereby refining their optimal solutions to align with the nadir objective vector. We prove that the bilevel optimization identifies the nadir objective vector under mild conditions. We compare BDNE with existing methods on various black-box MOPs. The results conform to the theoretical analysis and show the significant potential of BDNE for real-world application.

BrainBits: How Much of the Brain are Generative Reconstruction Methods Using?
When evaluating stimuli reconstruction results it is tempting to assume that higher fidelity text and image generation is due to an improved understanding of the brain or  more powerful signal extraction from neural recordings. However, in practice, new reconstruction methods could improve performance for at least three other reasons: learning more about the distribution of stimuli, becoming better at reconstructing text or images in general, or exploiting weaknesses in current image and/or text evaluation metrics. Here we disentangle how much of the reconstruction is due to these other factors vs. productively using the neural recordings. We introduce BrainBits, a method that uses a bottleneck to quantify the amount of signal extracted from neural recordings that is actually necessary to reproduce a method's reconstruction fidelity. We find that it takes surprisingly little information from the brain to produce reconstructions with high fidelity. In these cases, it is clear that the priors of the methods' generative models are so powerful that the outputs they produce extrapolate far beyond the neural signal they decode. Given that reconstructing stimuli can be improved independently by either improving signal extraction from the brain or by building more powerful generative models, improving the latter may fool us into thinking we are improving the former. We propose that methods should report a method-specific random baseline, a reconstruction ceiling, and a curve of performance as a function of bottleneck size, with the ultimate goal of using more of the neural recordings.

Breaking Determinism: Fuzzy Modeling of Sequential Recommendation Using Discrete State Space Diffusion Model
Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict items that users may be interested in based on their historical behavior sequences. We revisit SR from a novel information-theoretic perspective and find that conventional sequential modeling methods fail to adequately capture the randomness and unpredictability of user behavior. Inspired by fuzzy information processing theory, this paper introduces the DDSR model, which uses fuzzy sets of interaction sequences to overcome the limitations and better capture the evolution of users' real interests. Formally based on diffusion transition processes in discrete state spaces, which is unlike common diffusion models such as DDPM that operate in continuous domains. It is better suited for discrete data, using structured transitions instead of arbitrary noise introduction to avoid information loss. Additionally, to address the inefficiency of matrix transformations due to the vast discrete space, we use semantic labels derived from quantization or RQ-VAE to replace item IDs, enhancing efficiency and improving cold start issues. Testing on three public benchmark datasets shows that DDSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in various settings, demonstrating its potential and effectiveness in handling SR tasks.

Breaking Semantic Artifacts for Generalized AI-generated Image Detection
With the continuous evolution of AI-generated images, the generalized detection of them has become a crucial aspect of AI security. Existing detectors have focused on cross-generator generalization, while it remains unexplored whether these detectors can generalize across different image scenes, e.g., images from different datasets with different semantics. In this paper, we reveal that existing detectors suffer from substantial Accuracy drops in such cross-scene generalization. In particular, we attribute their failures to ''semantic artifacts'' in both real and generated images, to which detectors may overfit. To break such ''semantic artifacts'', we propose a simple yet effective approach based on conducting an image patch shuffle and then training an end-to-end patch-based classifier. We conduct a comprehensive open-world evaluation on 31 test sets, covering 7 Generative Adversarial Networks, 18 (variants of) Diffusion Models, and another 6 CNN-based generative models. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous approaches by 3.81\% (absolute) on average regarding cross-scene detection Accuracy. We also notice the superiority of our approach in open-world generalization, with an average Accuracy improvement of 6.74\% (absolute) across all test sets.

Breaking the curse of dimensionality in structured density estimation
We consider the problem of estimating a structured multivariate density, subject to Markov conditions implied by an undirected graph. In the worst case, without Markovian assumptions, this problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Our main result shows how the curse of dimensionality can be avoided or greatly alleviated under the Markov property, and applies to arbitrary graphs. While existing results along these lines focus on sparsity or manifold assumptions, we introduce a new graphical quantity called ``graph resilience'' and show that it dictates the optimal sample complexity. Surprisingly, although one might expect the sample complexity of this problem to scale with local graph parameters such as the degree, this turns out not to be the case. Through explicit examples, we compute uniform deviation bounds and illustrate how the curse of dimensionality in density estimation can thus be circumvented. Notable examples where the rate improves substantially include sequential, hierarchical, and spatial data.

Breaking the False Sense of Security in Backdoor Defense through Re-Activation Attack
Deep neural networks face persistent challenges in defending against backdoor attacks, leading to an ongoing battle between attacks and defenses. While existing backdoor defense strategies have shown promising performance on reducing attack success rates, can we confidently claim that the backdoor threat has truly been eliminated from the model? To address it, we re-investigate the characteristics of the backdoored models after defense (denoted as defense models). Surprisingly, we find that the original backdoors still exist in defense models derived from existing post-training defense strategies, and the backdoor existence is measured by a novel metric called backdoor existence coefficient. It implies that the backdoors just lie dormant rather than being eliminated. To further verify this finding, we empirically show that these dormant backdoors can be easily re-activated during inference, by manipulating the original trigger with well-designed tiny perturbation using universal adversarial attack. More practically, we extend our backdoor re-activation to black-box scenario, where the defense model can only be queried by the adversary during inference, and develop two effective methods, i.e., query-based and transfer-based backdoor re-activation attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified on both image classification and multimodal contrastive learning (i.e., CLIP) tasks. In conclusion, this work uncovers a critical vulnerability that has never been explored in existing defense strategies, emphasizing the urgency of designing more robust and advanced backdoor defense mechanisms in the future. Our code can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/backdoor_reactivation_attack/.

BricksRL: A Platform for Democratizing Robotics and Reinforcement Learning Research and Education with LEGO
We present BricksRL, a platform designed to democratize access to robotics for reinforcement learning research and education. BricksRL facilitates the creation, design, and training of custom LEGO robots in the real world by interfacing them with the TorchRL library for reinforcement learning agents. The integration of TorchRL with the LEGO hubs, via Bluetooth bidirectional communication, enables state-of-the-art reinforcement learning training on GPUs for a wide variety of LEGO builds. This offers a flexible and cost-efficient approach for scaling and also provides a robust infrastructure for robot-environment-algorithm communication. We present various experiments across tasks and robot configurations, providing built plans and training results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inexpensive LEGO robots can be trained end-to-end in the real world to achieve simple tasks, with training times typically under 120 minutes on a normal laptop. Moreover, we show how users can extend the capabilities, exemplified by the successful integration of non-LEGO sensors. By enhancing accessibility to both robotics and reinforcement learning, BricksRL establishes a strong foundation for democratized robotic learning in research and educational settings.

Bridging Gaps: Federated Multi-View Clustering in Heterogeneous Hybrid Views
Recently, federated multi-view clustering (FedMVC) has emerged to explore cluster structures in multi-view data distributed on multiple clients. Existing approaches often assume that clients are isomorphic and all of them belong to either single-view clients or multi-view clients. Despite their success, these methods also present limitations when dealing with practical FedMVC scenarios involving heterogeneous hybrid views, where a mixture of both single-view and multi-view clients exhibit varying degrees of heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a novel FedMVC framework, which concurrently addresses two challenges associated with heterogeneous hybrid views, i.e., client gap and view gap. To address the client gap, we design a local-synergistic contrastive learning approach that helps single-view clients and multi-view clients achieve consistency for mitigating heterogeneity among all clients. To address the view gap, we develop a global-specific weighting aggregation method, which encourages global models to learn complementary features from hybrid views. The interplay between local-synergistic contrastive learning and global-specific weighting aggregation mutually enhances the exploration of the data cluster structures distributed on multiple clients. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can handle the heterogeneous hybrid views in FedMVC and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Bridging Geometric States via Generative Modeling
The accurate prediction of geometric state evolution in complex systems is critical for advancing scientific domains such as quantum chemistry and material modeling. Traditional experimental and computational methods face challenges in terms of environmental constraints and computational demands, while current deep learning approaches still fall short in terms of precision and generality. In this work, we introduce the Geometric Diffusion Bridge (GDB), a novel generative modeling framework that accurately bridges initial and target geometric states. GDB leverages a probabilistic approach to evolve geometric state distributions, employing an equivariant diffusion bridge derived by a modified version of Doob's $h$-transform for connecting geometric states. This tailored diffusion process is anchored by initial and target geometric states as fixed endpoints and governed by equivariant transition kernels. Moreover, trajectory data can be seamlessly leveraged in our GDB framework by using a chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, providing a more detailed and accurate characterization of evolution dynamics. Theoretically, we conduct a thorough examination to confirm our framework's ability to preserve joint distributions of geometric states and capability to completely model the underlying dynamics inducing trajectory distributions with negligible error. Experimental evaluations across various real-world scenarios show that GDB surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, opening up a new pathway for accurately bridging geometric states and tackling crucial scientific challenges with improved accuracy and applicability.

Bridging Multicalibration and Out-of-distribution Generalization Beyond Covariate Shift
We establish a new model-agnostic optimization framework for out-of-distribution generalization via multicalibration, a criterion that ensures a predictor is calibrated across a family of overlapping groups. Multicalibration is shown to be associated with robustness of statistical inference under covariate shift. We further establish a link between multicalibration and robustness for prediction tasks both under and beyond covariate shift. We accomplish this by extending multicalibration to incorporate grouping functions that consider covariates and labels jointly. This leads to an equivalence of the extended multicalibration and invariance, an objective for robust learning in existence of concept shift. We show a linear structure of the grouping function class spanned by density ratios, resulting in a unifying framework for robust learning by designing specific grouping functions. We propose MC-Pseudolabel, a post-processing algorithm to achieve both extended multicalibration and out-of-distribution generalization. The algorithm, with lightweight hyperparameters and optimization through a series of supervised regression steps, achieves superior performance on real-world datasets with distribution shift.

Bridging semantics and pragmatics in information-theoretic emergent communication
Human languages support both semantic categorization and local pragmatic interactions that require context-sensitive reasoning about meaning. While semantics and pragmatics are two fundamental aspects of language, they are typically studied independently and their co-evolution is largely under-explored. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by studying how a shared lexicon may emerge from local pragmatic interactions. To this end, we extend a recent information-theoretic framework for emergent communication in artificial agents, which integrates utility maximization, associated with pragmatics, with general communicative constraints that are believed to shape human semantic systems. Specifically, we show how to adapt this framework to train agents via unsupervised pragmatic interactions, and then evaluate their emergent lexical semantics. We test this approach in a rich visual domain of naturalistic images, and find that key human-like properties of the lexicon emerge when agents are guided by both context-specific utility and general communicative pressures, suggesting that both aspects are crucial for understanding how language may evolve in humans and in artificial agents.

Bridging the Divide: Reconsidering Softmax and Linear Attention
Widely adopted in modern Vision Transformer designs, Softmax attention can effectively capture long-range visual information; however, it incurs excessive computational cost when dealing with high-resolution inputs. In contrast, linear attention naturally enjoys linear complexity and has great potential to scale up to higher-resolution images. Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory performance of linear attention greatly limits its practical application in various scenarios. In this paper, we take a step forward to close the gap between the linear and Softmax attention with novel theoretical analyses, which demystify the core factors behind the performance deviations. Specifically, we present two key perspectives to understand and alleviate the limitations of linear attention: the injective property and the local modeling ability. Firstly, we prove that linear attention is not injective, which is prone to assign identical attention weights to different query vectors, thus adding to severe semantic confusion since different queries correspond to the same outputs. Secondly, we confirm that effective local modeling is essential for the success of Softmax attention, in which linear attention falls short. The aforementioned two fundamental differences significantly contribute to the disparities between these two attention paradigms, which is demonstrated by our substantial empirical validation in the paper. In addition, more experiment results indicate that linear attention, as long as endowed with these two properties, can outperform Softmax attention across various tasks while maintaining lower computation complexity.

Buffer of Thoughts: Thought-Augmented Reasoning with Large Language Models
We introduce Buffer of Thoughts (BoT), a novel and versatile thought-augmented reasoning approach for enhancing accuracy, efficiency and robustness of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we propose meta-buffer to store a series of informative high-level thoughts, namely thought-template, distilled from the problem-solving processes across various tasks. Then for each problem, we retrieve a relevant thought-template and adaptively instantiate it with specific reasoning structures to conduct efficient reasoning. To guarantee the scalability and stability, we further propose buffer-manager to dynamically update the meta-buffer, thus enhancing the capacity of meta-buffer as more tasks are solved. We conduct extensive experiments on 10 challenging reasoning-intensive tasks, and achieve significant performance improvements over previous SOTA methods: 11\% on Game of 24, 20\% on Geometric Shapes and 51\% on Checkmate-in-One. Further analysis demonstrate the superior generalization ability and model robustness of our BoT, while requiring only 12\% of the cost of multi-query prompting methods (e.g., tree/graph of thoughts) on average.

Byzantine Robustness and Partial Participation Can Be Achieved at Once: Just Clip Gradient Differences
Distributed learning has emerged as a leading paradigm for training large machine learning models. However, in real-world scenarios, participants may be unreliable or malicious, posing a significant challenge to the integrity and accuracy of the trained models. Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms have been proposed to address these issues, but they often assume full participation from all clients, which is not always practical due to the unavailability of some clients or communication constraints. In our work, we propose the first distributed method with client sampling and provable tolerance to Byzantine workers. The key idea behind the developed method is the use of gradient clipping to control stochastic gradient differences in recursive variance reduction. This allows us to bound the potential harm caused by Byzantine workers, even during iterations when all sampled clients are Byzantine. Furthermore, we incorporate communication compression into the method to enhance communication efficiency. Under general assumptions, we prove convergence rates for the proposed method that match the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) theoretical results. We also propose a heuristic on how to adjust any Byzantine-robust method to a partial participation scenario via clipping.

Can an AI Agent Safely Run a Government? Existence of Probably Approximately Aligned Policies
While autonomous agents often surpass humans in their ability to handle vast and complex data, their potential misalignment (i.e., lack of transparency regarding their true objective) has thus far hindered their use in critical applications such as social decision processes. More importantly, existing alignment methods provide no formal guarantees on the safety of such models. Drawing from utility and social choice theory, we provide a novel quantitative definition of alignment in the context of social decision-making. Building on this definition, we introduce probably approximately aligned (i.e., near-optimal) policies, and we derive a sufficient condition for their existence. Lastly, recognizing the practical difficulty of satisfying this condition, we introduce the relaxed concept of safe (i.e., nondestructive) policies, and we propose a simple yet robust method to safeguard the black-box policy of any autonomous agent, ensuring all its actions are verifiably safe for the society.

Can LLMs Learn by Teaching? A Preliminary Study
Teaching to improve student models (e.g., knowledge distillation) is an extensively studied methodology in LLMs. However, for humans, teaching not only improves students but also improves teachers. We ask: Can LLMs also learn by teaching (LbT)? If yes, we can potentially unlock the possibility of continuously advancing the models without solely relying on human-produced data or stronger models. In this paper, we provide a preliminary exploration of this ambitious agenda. We show that LbT ideas can be easily incorporated into existing LLM training/prompting pipelines and provide noticeable improvements. Specifically, we design three methods, each mimicking one of the three levels of LbT in humans: observing students’ feedback, learning from the feedback, and learning iteratively, with the goals of improving answer accuracy without training and improving models’ inherent capability with fine-tuning. The findings are rather encouraging. For example, similar to LbT in human, we see that: (1) LbT can induce weak-to-strong generalization: strong models can improve themselves by teaching other weak models; (2) Diversity in students is important: teaching multiple students could be better than teaching one student or the teacher itself. We hope that this early promise can inspire future research on LbT and more broadly adopting the advanced techniques in education to improve LLMs.

Can neural operators always be continuously discretized?
In this work we consider the problem of discretization of neural operators in a general setting. Using category theory, we give a no-go theorem that shows that diffeomorphisms between Hilbert spaces may not admit any continuous approximations by diffeomorphisms on finite spaces, even if the discretization is non-linear. This shows how infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and finite-dimensional vector spaces fundamentally differ. A key take-away is that to obtain discretization invariance, considerable effort is needed to ensure that finite-dimensional approximations of neural operator converge not only as sequences of functions, but that their representations converge in a suitable sense as well. With this perspective, we give several positive results. We first show that strongly monotone diffeomorphism operators always admit finite-dimensional strongly monotone diffeomorphisms. Next we show that bilipschitz neural operators may always be written via the repeated alternating composition of strongly monotone neural operators and invertible linear maps. We also show that such operators may be inverted locally via iteration provided that such inverse exists. Finally, we conclude by showing how our framework may be used `out of the box' to prove quantitative approximation results for discretization of neural operators.

Can We Leave Deepfake Data Behind in Training Deepfake Detector?
The generalization ability of deepfake detectors is vital for their applications in real-world scenarios. One effective solution to enhance this ability is to train the models with manually-blended data, which we termed ``blendfake'', encouraging models to learn generic forgery artifacts like blending boundary. Interestingly, current SoTA methods utilize blendfake $\textit{without}$ incorporating any deepfake data in their training process. This is likely because previous empirical observations suggest that vanilla hybrid training (VHT), which combines deepfake and blendfake data, results in inferior performance to methods using only blendfake data (so-called "1+1<2"). Therefore, a critical question arises: Can we leave deepfake behind and rely solely on blendfake data to train an effective deepfake detector? Intuitively, as deepfakes also contain additional informative forgery clues ($\textit{e.g.,}$ deep generative artifacts), excluding all deepfake data in training deepfake detectors seems counter-intuitive. In this paper, we rethink the role of blendfake in detecting deepfakes and formulate the process from "real to blendfake to deepfake" to be a $\textit{progressive transition}$. Specifically, blendfake and deepfake can be explicitly delineated as the oriented pivot anchors between "real-to-fake" transitions. The accumulation of forgery information should be oriented and progressively increasing during this transition process. To this end, we propose an $\underline{O}$riented $\underline{P}$rogressive $\underline{R}$egularizor (OPR) to establish the constraints that compel the distribution of anchors to be discretely arranged. Furthermore, we introduce feature bridging to facilitate the smooth transition between adjacent anchors.  Extensive experiments confirm that our design allows leveraging forgery information from both blendfake and deepfake effectively and comprehensively.

Capability v.s. Behavior in Compositional Generalization: A Learning Dynamics Perspective
Studying the learning dynamics of capability (the underlying ability) and behavior (the actual execution of the capability) is critical to understanding generative models. However, studying these notions in large-scale models is challenging due to their complexity. We bridge this gap by simplifying the problem space with synthetic toy data. In this work, we introduce a framework called concept space to study the dynamics of a model's generalization behavior. We introduce the notion of a "concept signal" that governs the rate of concept learning. Using a synthetic dataset of 2D objects with different shapes, sizes, and colors, we study the generalization dynamics of the model in concept space and hypothesize: "Concept learning is a well-controlled phase transition in model capability, but the observed behavior resulting from this transition can be arbitrarily delayed, e.g., by the level of the concept signal." We test our hypothesis with several mechanistic interpretability tools, demonstrating a clear separation of model capability and behavior. Overall, this work defines a framework for understanding and taming the development of capability and behavior.

CAPE: Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding for Length Extrapolation
Positional encoding plays a crucial role in transformers, significantly impacting model performance and length generalization. Prior research has introduced absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE) to distinguish token positions in given sequences. However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility.Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be context-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors. Experimental validation on real-world datasets (Arxiv, Books3, and CHE) demonstrates that CAPE enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization. The model visualization suggests that our model can keep both local and anti-local information. Finally, we successfully train the model on sequence length 128 and achieve better performance at evaluation sequence length 8192, compared with other static positional encoding methods, revealing the benefit of the adaptive positional encoding method.

CaptainCook4D: A Dataset for Understanding Errors in Procedural Activities
Following step-by-step procedures is an essential component of various activities carried out by individuals in their daily lives. These procedures serve as a guiding framework that helps to achieve goals efficiently, whether it is assembling furniture or preparing a recipe. However, the complexity and duration of procedural activities inherently increase the likelihood of making errors. Understanding such procedural activities from a sequence of frames is a challenging task that demands an accurate interpretation of visual information and the ability to reason about the structure of the activity. To this end, we collect a new egocentric 4D dataset, CaptainCook4D, comprising 384 recordings (94.5 hours) of people performing recipes in real kitchen environments. This dataset consists of two distinct types of activity: one in which participants adhere to the provided recipe instructions and another in which they deviate and induce errors. We provide 5.3K step annotations and 10K fine-grained action annotations and benchmark the dataset for the following tasks: error recognition, multistep localization and procedure learning.

Cardinality-Aware Set Prediction and Top-$k$ Classification
We present a detailed study of cardinality-aware top-$k$ classification, a novel approach that aims to learn an accurate top-$k$ set predictor while maintaining a low cardinality. We introduce a new target loss function tailored to this setting that accounts for both the classification error and the cardinality of the set predicted.  To optimize this loss function, we propose two families of surrogate losses: cost-sensitive comp-sum losses and cost-sensitive constrained losses. Minimizing these loss functions leads to new cardinality-aware algorithms that we describe in detail in the case of both top-$k$ and threshold-based classifiers. We establish $H$-consistency bounds for our cardinality-aware surrogate loss functions, thereby providing a strong theoretical foundation for our algorithms. We report the results of extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and SVHN datasets demonstrating the effectiveness and benefits of our cardinality-aware algorithms.

CARES: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Trustworthiness in Medical Vision Language Models
Artificial intelligence has significantly impacted medical applications, particularly with the advent of Medical Large Vision Language Models (Med-LVLMs), sparking optimism for the future of automated and personalized healthcare. However, the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs remains unverified, posing significant risks for future model deployment. In this paper, we introduce CARES and aim to comprehensively evaluate the Trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across the medical domain. We assess the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across five dimensions, including trustfulness, fairness, safety, privacy, and robustness. CARES comprises about 41K question-answer pairs in both closed and open-ended formats, covering 16 medical image modalities and 27 anatomical regions. Our analysis reveals that the models consistently exhibit concerns regarding trustworthiness, often displaying factual inaccuracies and failing to maintain fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, they are vulnerable to attacks and demonstrate a lack of privacy awareness. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/CARES.

Cascade of phase transitions in the training of energy-based models
In this paper, we investigate the feature encoding process in a prototypical energy-based generative model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model’s weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of thermodynamic phase transitions that shape the principal learning modes of the empirical probability distribution. We first describe this process analytically in several controlled setups that allow us to fully monitor the training dynamics until convergence. We then validate these findings by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By studying the phase behavior over data sets of increasing dimension, we show that these phase transitions are genuine in the thermodynamic sense. Moreover, we propose a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis, confirming that the initial phase transition, reminiscent of the paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition in mean-field ferromagnetism models, is governed by mean-field critical exponents.

CAT3D: Create Anything in 3D with Multi-View Diffusion Models
Advances in 3D reconstruction have enabled high-quality 3D capture, but require a user to collect hundreds to thousands of images to create a 3D scene. We present CAT3D, a method for creating anything in 3D by simulating this real-world capture process with a multi-view diffusion model. Given any number of input images and a set of target novel viewpoints, our model generates highly consistent novel views of a scene. These generated views can be used as input to robust 3D reconstruction techniques to produce 3D representations that can be rendered from any viewpoint in real-time. CAT3D can create entire 3D scenes in as little as one minute, and outperforms existing methods for single image and few-view 3D scene creation.

Categorical Flow Matching on Statistical Manifolds
We introduce Statistical Flow Matching (SFM), a novel and mathematically rigorous flow-matching framework on the manifold of parameterized probability measures inspired by the results from information geometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the discrete generation problem by instantiating SFM on the manifold of categorical distributions whose geometric properties remain unexplored in previous discrete generative models. Utilizing the Fisher information metric, we equip the manifold with a Riemannian structure whose intrinsic geometries are effectively leveraged by following the shortest paths of geodesics. We develop an efficient training and sampling algorithm that overcomes numerical stability issues with a diffeomorphism between manifolds. Our distinctive geometric perspective of statistical manifolds allows us to apply optimal transport during training and interpret SFM as following the steepest direction of the natural gradient. Unlike previous models that rely on variational bounds for likelihood estimation, SFM enjoys the exact likelihood calculation for arbitrary probability measures. We manifest that SFM can learn more complex patterns on the statistical manifold where existing models often fail due to strong prior assumptions. Comprehensive experiments on real-world generative tasks ranging from image, text to biological domains further demonstrate that SFM achieves higher sampling quality and likelihood than other discrete diffusion or flow-based models.

Causal Context Adjustment Loss for Learned Image Compression
In recent years, learned image compression (LIC) technologies have surpassed conventional methods notably in terms of rate-distortion (RD) performance. Most present learned techniques are VAE-based with an autoregressive entropy model, which obviously promotes the RD performance by utilizing the decoded causal context. However, existing methods are highly dependent on the fixed hand-crafted causal context. The question of how to obtain a more effective causal context, thereby making autoregressive entropy models more accurate, is worth exploring. In this paper, we make the first attempt in investigating the way to explicitly adjust the causal context with our proposed Causal Context Adjustment loss (CCA-loss). By imposing the CCA-loss, we enable the neural network to spontaneously adjust the causal context, making the estimate of latent representations more accurate by possessing the decoded causal context. Furthermore, as transformer technology develops remarkably, variants of which have been adopted by many state-of-the-art (SOTA) LIC techniques. However, existing computing devices have not adapted the calculation of attention mechanism well, which leads to a burden in computation quantity and inference latency. To overcome it, we attempt to establish a convolutional neural network (CNN) image compression model and adopt the unevenly channel-wise grouped strategy for high efficiency. Ultimately, the proposed CNN-based LIC network trained with our Causal Context Adjustment loss attains a great trade-off between inference latency and rate-distortion performance.

Causal Contrastive Learning for Counterfactual Regression Over Time
Estimating treatment effects over time holds significance in various domains, including precision medicine, epidemiology, economy, and marketing. This paper introduces a unique approach to counterfactual regression over time, emphasizing long-term predictions. Distinguishing itself from existing models like Causal Transformer, our approach highlights the efficacy of employing RNNs for long-term forecasting, complemented by Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and Information Maximization (InfoMax). Emphasizing efficiency, we avoid the need for computationally expensive transformers. Leveraging CPC, our method captures long-term dependencies within time-varying confounders. Notably, recent models have disregarded the importance of invertible representation, compromising identification assumptions. To remedy this, we employ the InfoMax principle, maximizing a lower bound of mutual information between sequence data and its representation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art counterfactual estimation results using both synthetic and real-world data, marking the pioneering incorporation of Contrastive Predictive Encoding in causal inference.

CausalDiff: Causality-Inspired Disentanglement via Diffusion Model for Adversarial Defense
Despite ongoing efforts to defend neural classifiers from adversarial attacks, they remain vulnerable, especially to unseen attacks. In contrast, humans are difficult to be cheated by subtle manipulations, since we make judgments only based on essential factors. Inspired by this observation, we attempt to model label generation with essential label-causative factors and incorporate label-non-causative factors to assist data generation. For an adversarial example, we aim to discriminate the perturbations as non-causative factors and make predictions only based on the label-causative factors. Concretely, we propose a casual diffusion model (CausalDiff) that adapts diffusion models for conditional data generation and disentangles the two types of casual factors by learning towards a novel casual information bottleneck objective. Empirically, CausalDiff has significantly outperformed state-of-the-art defense methods on various unseen attacks, achieving an average robustness of 86.39\% (+4.01\%) on CIFAR-10, 56.25\% (+3.13\%) on CIFAR-100, and 82.62\% (+4.93\%) on GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark).

Causal Discovery from Event Sequences by Local Cause-Effect Attribution
We study the problem of causal discovery from event sequences, with the goal of recovering the underlying causal graph and causal mechanisms over different types of events. To this end, we introduce a new causal model, where individual events of the cause variable trigger events of the effect variable with dynamic delays. We show that in contrast to existing methods based on Granger causality, our model is identifiable for both instant and delayed effects.We base our approach on the Algorithmic Markov Condition, by which we identify the true causal network as the one that minimizes the Kolmogorov complexity. As the Kolmogorov complexity is not computable, we instantiate our model via the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. We show our score is consistent and identifies the true causal directions. To discover good causal graphs in practice we introduce the Cascade algorithm, which adds edges in topological order. The evaluation of Cascade on synthetic and real-world datasets shows it works well in practice, outperforming existing methods.

Causal Effect Identification in a Sub-Population with Latent Variables
The s-ID problem seeks to compute a causal effect in a specific sub-population from the observational data pertaining to the same sub population (Abouei et al., 2023). This problem has been addressed when all the variables in the system are observable. In this paper, we consider an extension of the s-ID problem that allows for the presence of latent variables. To tackle the challenges induced by the presence of latent variables in a sub-population, we first extend the classical relevant graphical definitions, such as c-components and Hedges, initially defined for the so-called ID problem (Pearl, 1995; Tian & Pearl, 2002), to their new counterparts. Subsequently, we propose a sound algorithm for the s-ID problem with latent variables.

Causal Imitation for Markov Decision Processes: a Partial Identification Approach
Imitation learning enables an agent to learn from expert demonstrations when the performance measure is unknown and the reward signal is not specified. Standard imitation methods do not generally apply when the learner and the expert's sensory capabilities mismatch and demonstrations are contaminated with unobserved confounding bias. To address these challenges, recent advancements in causal imitation learning have been pursued. However, these methods often require access to underlying causal structures that might not always be available, posing practical challenges.In this paper, we investigate robust imitation learning within the framework of canonical Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) using partial identification, allowing the agent to achieve expert performance even when the system dynamics are not uniquely determined from the confounded expert demonstrations. Specifically, first, we theoretically demonstrate that when unobserved confounders (UCs) exist in an MDP, the learner is generally unable to imitate expert performance. We then explore imitation learning in partially identifiable settings --- either transition distribution or reward function is non-identifiable from the available data and knowledge. Augmenting the celebrated GAIL method (Ho \& Ermon, 2016), our analysis leads to two novel causal imitation algorithms that can obtain effective policies guaranteed to achieve expert performance.

Causal Inference in the Closed-Loop: Marginal Structural Models for Sequential Excursion Effects
Optogenetics is widely used to study the effects of neural circuit manipulation on behavior. However, the paucity of causal inference methodological work on this topic has resulted in analysis conventions that discard information, and constrain the scientific questions that can be posed. To fill this gap, we introduce a nonparametric causal inference framework for analyzing "closed-loop" designs, which use dynamic policies that assign treatment based on covariates. In this setting, standard methods can introduce bias and occlude causal effects. Building on the sequentially randomized experiments literature in causal inference, our approach extends history-restricted marginal structural models for dynamic regimes. In practice, our framework can identify a wide range of causal effects of optogenetics on trial-by-trial behavior, such as, fast/slow-acting, dose-response, additive/antagonistic, and floor/ceiling. Importantly, it does so without requiring negative controls, and can estimate how causal effect magnitudes evolve across time points. From another view, our work extends "excursion effect" methods---popular in the mobile health literature---to enable estimation of causal contrasts for treatment sequences greater than length one, in the presence of positivity violations. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, enabling hypothesis testing of these causal effects. We demonstrate our approach on data from a recent study of dopaminergic activity on learning, and show how our method reveals relevant effects obscured in standard analyses.

Causal vs. Anticausal merging of predictors
In this article we study the differences arising from merging predictors in the causal and anticausal directions using the same data. In particular we study the asymmetries that arise in a simple model where we merge the predictors using one binary variable as target and two continuous variables as predictors. We use Causal Maximum Entropy (CMAXENT) as inductive bias to merge the predictors, however, we expect similar differences to hold also when we use any different merging method that takes into account asymmetries between cause and effect. We show that if we observe all bivariate distributions, the CMAXENT solution reduces to a logistic regression in the causal direction and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in the anticausal direction. Furthermore, we study how the decision boundaries of these two solutions differ whenever we observe only some of the bivariate distributions, with implications for Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL), and Out-Of-Variable (OOV) generalisation.

CemiFace: Center-based Semi-hard Synthetic Face Generation for Face Recognition
Privacy issue is a main concern in developing face recognition techniques. Although synthetic face images can partially mitigate potential legal risks while maintaining effective face recognition (FR) performance, FR models trained by face images synthesized by existing generative approaches frequently suffer from performance degradation problems due to the insufficient discriminative quality of these synthesized samples. In this paper, we systematically investigate what contributes to solid face recognition model training, and reveal that face images with certain degree of similarities to their identity centers show great effectiveness in the performance of trained FR models. Inspired by this, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach (namely Center-based Semi-hard Synthetic FaceGeneration (CemiFace)) which produces facial samples with various levels of similarity to the subject center, thus allowing to generate face datasets containing effective discriminative samples for training face recognition. Experimental results show that with a modest degree of similarity, training on the generated dataset can produce competitive performance compared to previous generation methods. The code and synthesized data will be released upon acceptance.

Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized $\alpha$-Smoothing for Regression Models
Certified adversarial robustness of large-scale deep networks has progressed substantially after the introduction of randomized smoothing. Deep net classifiers are now provably robust in their predictions against a large class of threat models, including $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, and $\ell_\infty$ norm-bounded attacks. Certified robustness analysis by randomized smoothing has not been performed for deep regression networks where the output variable is continuous and unbounded. In this paper, we extend the existing results for randomized smoothing into regression models using powerful tools from robust statistics, in particular, $\alpha$-trimming filter as the smoothing function. Adjusting the hyperparameter $\alpha$ achieves a smooth trade-off between desired certified robustness and utility. For the first time, we propose a benchmark for certified robust regression in visual positioning systems using the \textit{Cambridge Landmarks} dataset where robustness analysis is essential for  autonomous navigation of AI agents and self-driving cars. Code will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com} upon publication of this paper.

Certified Robustness for Deep Equilibrium Models via Serialized Random Smoothing
Implicit models such as Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) have emerged as promising alternative approaches for building deep neural networks. Their certified robustness has gained increasing research attention due to security concerns. Existing certified defenses for DEQs employing interval bound propagation and Lipschitz-bounds not only offer conservative certification bounds but also are restricted to specific forms of DEQs. In this paper, we provide the first randomized smoothing certified defense for DEQs to solve these limitations. Our study reveals that simply applying randomized smoothing to certify DEQs provides certified robustness generalized to large-scale datasets but incurs extremely expensive computation costs. To reduce computational redundancy, we propose a novel Serialized Randomized Smoothing (SRS) approach that leverages historical information. Additionally, we derive a new certified radius estimation for SRS to theoretically ensure the correctness of our algorithm. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on image recognition demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly accelerate the certification of DEQs by up to 7x almost without sacrificing the certified accuracy. The implementation will be publicly available upon the acceptance of this work.

Challenges of Generating Structurally Diverse Graphs
For many graph-related problems, it can be essential to have a set of structurally diverse graphs. For instance, such graphs can be used for testing graph algorithms or their neural approximations. However, to the best of our knowledge, the problem of generating structurally diverse graphs has not been explored in the literature. In this paper, we fill this gap. First, we discuss how to define diversity for a set of graphs, why this task is non-trivial, and how one can choose a proper diversity measure. Then, for a given diversity measure, we propose and compare several algorithms optimizing it: we consider approaches based on standard random graph models, local graph optimization, genetic algorithms, and neural generative models. We show that it is possible to significantly improve diversity over basic random graph generators. Additionally, our analysis of generated graphs allows us to better understand the properties of graph distances: depending on which diversity measure is used for optimization, the obtained graphs may possess very different structural properties which gives insights about the sensitivity of the graph distance underlying the diversity measure.

ChaosBench: A Multi-Channel, Physics-Based Benchmark for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Climate Prediction
Accurate prediction of climate in the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale is crucial for disaster preparedness and robust decision making amidst climate change. Yet, forecasting beyond the weather timescale is challenging because it deals with problems other than initial conditions, including boundary interaction, butterfly effect, and our inherent lack of physical understanding. At present, existing benchmarks tend to have shorter forecasting range of up-to 15 days, do not include a wide range of operational baselines, and lack physics-based constraints for explainability. Thus, we propose ChaosBench, a challenging benchmark to extend the predictability range of data-driven weather emulators to S2S timescale. First, ChaosBench is comprised of variables beyond the typical surface-atmospheric ERA5 to also include ocean, ice, and land reanalysis products that span over 45 years to allow for full Earth system emulation that respects boundary conditions. We also propose physics-based, in addition to deterministic and probabilistic metrics, to ensure a physically-consistent ensemble that accounts for butterfly effect. Furthermore, we evaluate on a diverse set of physics-based forecasts from four national weather agencies as baselines to our data-driven counterpart such as ClimaX, PanguWeather, GraphCast, and FourCastNetV2. Overall, we find methods originally developed for weather-scale applications fail on S2S task: their performance simply collapse to an unskilled climatology. Nonetheless, we outline and demonstrate several strategies that can potentially extend the predictability range of existing weather emulators, including the use of ensembles and robust control of error propagation. Our benchmark, datasets, and instructions are available at https://leap-stc.github.io/ChaosBench.

CHASE: Learning Convex Hull Adaptive Shift for Skeleton-based Multi-Entity Action Recognition
Skeleton-based multi-entity action recognition is a challenging task aiming to identify interactive actions or group activities involving multiple diverse entities. Existing single-entity action recognition models often fall short in this task due to the inherent distribution discrepancies among the entity skeletons, leading to suboptimal backbone optimization. To this end, we introduce a Convex Hull Adaptive Shift based multi-Entity action recognition method (CHASE), which mitigates inter-entity distribution gaps and benefits backbone learning. Specifically, we formulate the Implicit Convex Hull Constrained Adaptive Shift (ICHAS) to direct the origin towards the region within the skeleton convex hull. Additionally, we parameterize a lightweight Coefficient Learning Block (CLB), facilitating sample-adaptive weight representation. Moreover, we introduce the Mini-batch Pair-wise Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MPMMD) as an auxiliary objective to guide discrepancy minimization. With ICHAS as the constraint, CLB as learnable variables, and MPMMD as the objective, CHASE finds the optimal sample-adaptive shift that minimizes distribution discrepancies. Extensive experiments on six datasets, including NTU Mutual 11/26, H2O, Assembly101, Collective Activity and Volleyball, consistently verify our approach by seamlessly adapting to single-entity backbones and boosting their performance in multi-entity action recognition. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CHASE-0 .

ChatQA: Surpassing GPT-4 on Conversational QA and RAG
In this work, we introduce ChatQA, a suite of models that outperform GPT-4 on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and conversational question answering (QA).  To enhance generation, we propose a two-stage instruction tuning method that significantly boosts the performance of RAG.  For effective retrieval, we introduce a dense retriever optimized for conversational QA, which yields results comparable to the alternative state-of-the-art query rewriting models, while substantially reducing deployment costs.  We also present the ChatRAG Bench, which encompasses ten datasets covering comprehensive evaluations on RAG, table-related QA, arithmetic calculations, and scenarios involving unanswerable questions.  Our ChatQA-1.0-70B (score: 54.14), built on Llama2, a weaker foundation model than GPT-4, can slightly outperform GPT-4-0613 (score: 53.90) and GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09 (score: 54.03) on the ChatRAG Bench, without relying on any synthetic data from OpenAI GPT models.   Notably, Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B model surpasses the accuracy of GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09 by a margin. These results demonstrate the exceptional quality of the proposed ChatQA recipe. To advance research in this field, we open-sourced the model weights, instruction tuning data, ChatRAG Bench, and retriever for the community.

CIFD: Controlled Information Flow to Enhance Knowledge Distillation
Knowledge Distillation is the mechanism by which the insights gained from a larger teacher model are transferred to a smaller student model. However, the transfer suffers when the teacher model is significantly larger than the student. To overcome this, prior works have proposed training intermediately sized models, Teacher Assistants (TAs) to help the transfer process. However, training TAs is expensive, as training these models is a knowledge transfer task in itself. Further, these TAs are larger than the student model and training them especially in large data settings can be computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Controlled Information Flow for Knowledge Distillation (CIFD) consisting of two components. First, we propose a significantly smaller alternatives to TAs, the Rate-Distortion Module (RDM) which uses the teacher's penultimate layer embedding and a information rate-constrained bottleneck layer to replace the Teacher Assistant model. RDMs are smaller and easier to train than TAs, especially in large data regimes, since they operate on the teacher embeddings and do not need to relearn low level input feature extractors. Also, by varying the information rate across the bottleneck, RDMs can replace TAs of different sizes. Secondly, we propose the use of Information Bottleneck Module in the student model, which is crucial for regularization in the presence of a large number of RDMs. We show comprehensive state-of-the-art results of the proposed method over large datasets like Imagenet. Further, we show the significant improvement in distilling CLIP like models over a huge 12M image-text dataset. It outperforms CLIP specialized distillation methods across five zero-shot classification datasets and two zero-shot image-text retrieval datasets.

Classic GNNs are Strong Baselines: Reassessing GNNs for Node Classification
Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as popular alternatives to traditional message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), due to their theoretically superior expressiveness and impressive performance reported on standard node classification benchmarks, often significantly outperforming GNNs. In this paper, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis to reevaluate the performance of three classic GNN models (GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE) against GTs. Our findings suggest that the previously reported superiority of GTs may have been overstated due to suboptimal hyperparameter configurations in GNNs. Remarkably, with slight hyperparameter tuning, these classic GNN models achieve state-of-the-art performance, matching or even exceeding that of recent GTs across 17 out of the 18 diverse datasets examined. Additionally, we conduct detailed ablation studies to investigate the influence of various GNN configurations—such as normalization, dropout, residual connections, network depth, and jumping knowledge mode—on node classification performance. Our study aims to promote a higher standard of empirical rigor in the field of graph machine learning, encouraging more accurate comparisons and evaluations of model capabilities.

Classification Diffusion Models: Revitalizing Density Ratio Estimation
A prominent family of methods for learning data distributions relies on density ratio estimation (DRE), where a model is trained to *classify* between data samples and samples from some reference distribution. DRE-based models can directly output the likelihood for any given input, a highly desired property that is lacking in most generative techniques. Nevertheless, to date, DRE methods have struggled to accurately capture the distributions of complex high-dimensional data like images, which led to reduced research attention over the years. In this work we present *classification diffusion models* (CDMs), a DRE-based generative method that adopts the formalism of denoising diffusion models (DDMs) while making use of a classifier that predicts the level of noise added to a clean signal. Our method is based on an analytical connection that we derive between an MSE-optimal denoiser for white Gaussian noise and a cross-entropy-optimal classifier for predicting the noise level. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first DRE-based technique that can successfully generate images. Furthermore, it can output the likelihood of any input in a single forward pass, achieving state-of-the-art negative log likelihood (NLL) among methods with this property.

ClavaDDPM: Multi-relational Data Synthesis with Cluster-guided Diffusion Models
Recent research in tabular data synthesis has focused on single tables, whereas real-world applications often involve complex data with tens or hundreds of interconnected tables. Previous approaches to synthesizing multi-relational (multi-table) data fall short in two key aspects: scalability for larger datasets and capturing long-range dependencies, such as correlations between attributes spread across different tables. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in tabular data modeling, we introduce  \textbf{C}luster \textbf{La}tent \textbf{Va}riable guided \textbf{D}enoising \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{P}robabilistic \textbf{M}odels (ClavaDDPM). This novel approach leverages clustering labels as intermediaries to model relationships between tables, specifically focusing on foreign key constraints. ClavaDDPM leverages the robust generation capabilities of diffusion models while incorporating efficient algorithms to propagate the learned latent variables across tables. This enables ClavaDDPM to capture long-range dependencies effectively.  Extensive evaluations on multi-table datasets of varying sizes show that ClavaDDPM significantly outperforms existing methods for these long-range dependencies while remaining competitive on utility metrics for single-table data.

CleanDiffuser: An Easy-to-use Modularized Library for Diffusion Models in Decision Making
Leveraging the powerful generative capability of diffusion models (DMs) to build decision-making agents has achieved extensive success. However, there is still a demand for an easy-to-use and modularized open-source library that offers customized and efficient development for DM-based decision-making algorithms. In this work, we introduce **CleanDiffuser**, the first DM library specifically designed for decision-making algorithms. By revisiting the roles of DMs in the decision-making domain, we identify a set of essential sub-modules that constitute the core of CleanDiffuser, allowing for the implementation of various DM algorithms with simple and flexible building blocks. To demonstrate the reliability and flexibility of CleanDiffuser, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of various DM algorithms implemented with CleanDiffuser across an extensive range of tasks. The analytical experiments provide a wealth of valuable design choices and insights, reveal opportunities and challenges, and lay a solid groundwork for future research. CleanDiffuser will provide long-term support to the decision-making community, enhancing reproducibility and fostering the development of more robust solutions.

ClevrSkills: Compositional Language And Visual Understanding in Robotics
Robotics tasks are highly compositional by nature. For example, to perform a high-level task like cleaning the table a robot must employ low-level capabilities of moving the effectors to the objects on the table, pick them up and then move them off the table one-by-one, while re-evaluating the consequently dynamic scenario in the process. Given that large vision language models (VLMs) have shown progress on many tasks that require high level, human like reasoning, we ask the question: if the models are taught the requisite low-level capabilities, can they compose them in novel ways to achieve interesting high-level tasks like cleaning the table without having to be explicitly taught so?To this end, we present ClevrSkills - a benchmark suite for compositional understanding in robotics. ClevrSkills is an environment suite developed on top of the ManiSkill2 simulator and an accompanying dataset. The dataset contains trajectories generated on a range of robotics tasks with language and visual annotations as well as multi-modal prompts as task specification. The suite includes a curriculum of tasks with three levels of compositional understanding, starting with simple tasks requiring basic motor skills. We benchmark multiple different VLM baselines on ClevrSkills and show that even after being pre-trained on large numbers of tasks, these models fail on compositional reasoning in robotics tasks.

CLIPAway: Harmonizing focused embeddings for removing objects via diffusion models
Advanced image editing techniques, particularly inpainting, are essential for seamlessly removing unwanted elements while preserving visual integrity. Traditional GAN-based methods have achieved notable success, but recent advancements in diffusion models have produced superior results due to their training on large-scale datasets, enabling the generation of remarkably realistic inpainted images.Despite their strengths, diffusion models often struggle with object removal tasks without explicit guidance, leading to unintended hallucinations of the removed object. To address this issue, we introduce CLIPAway, a novel approach leveraging CLIP embeddings to focus on background regions while excluding foreground elements. CLIPAway enhances inpainting accuracy and quality by identifying embeddings that prioritize the background, thus achieving seamless object removal. Unlike other methods that rely on specialized training datasets or costly manual annotations, CLIPAway provides a flexible, plug-and-play solution compatible with various diffusion-based inpainting techniques.

CLIP in Mirror: Disentangling text from visual images through reflection
The CLIP network excels in various tasks, but struggles with text-visual images i.e., images that contain both text and visual objects; it risks confusing textual and visual representations. To address this issue, we propose MirrorCLIP, a zero-shot framework, which disentangles the image features of CLIP by exploiting the difference in the mirror effect between visual objects and text in the images. Specifically, MirrorCLIP takes both original and flipped images as inputs, comparing their features dimension-wise in the latent space to generate disentangling masks. With disentangling masks, we further design filters to separate textual and visual factors more precisely, and then get disentangled representations. Qualitative experiments using stable diffusion models and class activation mapping (CAM) validate the effectiveness of our disentanglement. Moreover, our proposed MirrorCLIP reduces confusion when encountering text-visual images and achieves a substantial improvement on typographic defense, further demonstrating its superior ability of disentanglement.

CLIPLoss and Norm-Based Data Selection Methods for Multimodal Contrastive Learning
Data selection has emerged as a core issue for large-scale visual-language model pretaining (e.g., CLIP), particularly with noisy web-curated datasets. Three main data selection approaches are: (1) leveraging external non-CLIP models to aid data selection, (2) training new CLIP-style embedding models that are more effective at selecting high-quality data than the original OpenAI CLIP model, and (3) designing better metrics or strategies universally applicable to any CLIP embedding without requiring specific model properties (e.g., CLIPScore is one popular metric).  While the first two approaches have been extensively studied, the third remains under-explored. In this paper, we advance the third approach by proposing two new methods. Firstly, instead of classical CLIP scores that only consider the alignment between two modalities from a single sample, we introduce $\textbf{negCLIPLoss}$, a CLIP loss-inspired method that adds the alignment between one sample and its contrastive pairs as an extra normalization term for better quality measurement. Secondly, when downstream tasks are known, we propose a new norm-based metric, $\textbf{NormSim}$, to measure the similarity between pretraining data and target data. We test our methods on the data selection benchmark, DataComp [Gadre et al., 2023]. Compared to the best baseline using only OpenAI's CLIP-L/14, our methods achieve a 5.3\% improvement on ImageNet-1k and a 2.8\% improvement on 38 downstream evaluation tasks. Moreover, both $\textbf{negCLIPLoss}$ and $\textbf{NormSim}$ are compatible with existing techniques. By combining our methods with the current best methods DFN [Fang et al., 2023] and HYPE [Kim et al., 2024], we can boost average performance on downstream tasks by 0.9\%, achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Closed-Loop Visuomotor Control with Generative Expectation for Robotic Manipulation
Despite significant progress in robotics and embodied AI in recent years, deploying robots for long-horizon tasks remains a great challenge. Majority of prior arts adhere to an open-loop philosophy and lack real-time feedback, leading to error accumulation and undesirable robustness. A handful of approaches have endeavored to establish feedback mechanisms leveraging pixel-level differences or pre-trained visual representations, yet their efficacy and adaptability have been found to be constrained. Inspired by classic closed-loop control systems, we propose CLOVER, a closed-loop visuomotor control framework that incorporates feedback mechanisms to improve adaptive robotic control. CLOVER consists of a text-conditioned video diffusion model for generating visual plans as reference inputs, a measurable embedding space for accurate error quantification, and a feedback-driven controller that refines actions from feedback and initiates replans as needed. Our framework exhibits notable advancement in real-world robotic tasks and achieves state-of-the-art on CALVIN benchmark, improving by 8\% over previous open-loop counterparts.

Clustering in Causal Attention Masking
This work presents a modification of the self-attention dynamics proposed in Geshkovski et al to better reflect the practically relevant causally masked attention used in transformer architectures for generative AI. This modification translates into an interacting particle system that cannot be interpreted as a mean-field gradient flow. Despite this loss of structure, we significantly strengthen the results of Geshkovski et al in this context: While previous rigorous results focused on cases where all three matrices (key, query, and value) were scaled identities, we prove asymptotic convergence to a single cluster for arbitrary key-query matrices and value matrix equal to the identity.Additionally, we establish a connection to the classical R\'enyi parking problem from combinatorial geometry to make initial theoretical steps towards demonstrating the existence of meta-stable states.

Clustering with Non-adaptive Subset Queries
Recovering the underlying clustering of a set $U$ of $n$ points by asking pair-wise same-cluster queries has garnered significant interest in the last decade. Given a query $S \subset U$, $|S|=2$, the oracle returns "yes" if the points are in the same cluster and "no" otherwise. We study a natural generalization of this problem to subset queries for $|S|>2$, where the oracle returns the number of clusters intersecting $S$. Our aim is to determine the minimum number of queries needed for exactly recovering an arbitrary $k$-clustering. We focus on non-adaptive schemes, where all the queries are asked in one round, thus allowing for the querying process to be parallelized, which is a highly desirable property. For adaptive algorithms with pair-wise queries, the complexity is known to be $\Theta(nk)$, where $k$ is the number of clusters. In contrast, non-adaptive pair-wise query algorithms are extremely limited: even for $k=3$, such algorithms require $\Omega(n^2)$ queries, which matches the trivial $O(n^2)$ upper bound attained by querying every pair of points. Allowing for subset queries of unbounded size, $O(n)$ queries is possible with an adaptive scheme.  However, the realm of non-adaptive algorithms remains completely unknown. Is it possible to attain algorithms that are non-adaptive while still making a near-linear number of queries?In this paper, we give the first non-adaptive algorithms for clustering with subset queries. We provide, (i) a non-adaptive algorithm making $O(n \log^2 n \log k)$ queries which improves to $O(n \log k)$ when the cluster sizes are within any constant factor of each other, (ii) for constant $k$, a non-adaptive algorithm making $O(n \log{\log{n}})$ queries. In addition to non-adaptivity, we take into account other practical considerations, such as enforcing a bound on query size.  For constant $k$, we give an algorithm making $\smash{\widetilde{O}(n^2/s^2)}$ queries on subsets of size at most $s \leq \sqrt{n}$, which is optimal among all non-adaptive algorithms within a $\log n$-factor. For arbitrary $k$, the dependence varies as $\tilde{O}(n^2/s)$.

Cluster-Learngene: Inheriting Adaptive Clusters for Vision Transformers
In recent years, the merging of vast datasets with powerful computational resources has led to the emergence of large pre-trained models in the field of deep learning. However, the common practices often overgeneralize the applicability of these models, overlooking the task-specific resource constraints. To mitigate this issue, we propose \textbf{Cluster-Learngene}, which effectively clusters critical internal modules from a large ancestry model and then inherits them to initialize descendant models of elastic scales. Specifically, based on the density characteristics of attention heads, our method adaptively clusters attention heads of each layer and position-wise feed-forward networks (FFNs) in the ancestry model as the learngene. Moreover, we introduce priority weight-sharing and learnable parameter transformations that expand the learngene to initialize descendant models of elastic scales. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that Cluster-Learngene not only is more efficient compared to other initialization methods but also customizes models of elastic scales according to downstream task resources.

Cluster-wise Graph Transformer with Dual-granularity Kernelized Attention
In the realm of graph learning, there is a category of methods that conceptualize graphs as hierarchical structures, utilizing node clustering to capture broader structural information. While generally effective, these methods often rely on a fixed graph coarsening routine, leading to overly homogeneous cluster representations and loss of node-level information. In this paper, we envision the graph as a network of interconnected node sets without resorting to the graph coarsening pipeline. To enable effective information transfer among these node sets, we propose the Node-to-Cluster Attention (N2C-Attn) mechanism. N2C-Attn incorporates techniques from Multiple Kernel Learning into the kernelized attention framework, effectively capturing information at both node and cluster levels. We then devise an efficient form for N2C-Attn using the cluster-wise message-passing framework, achieving linear time complexity. We further analyze how N2C-Attn combines bi-level feature maps of queries and keys, demonstrating its capability to merge dual-granularity information. The resulting architecture, Cluster-wise Graph Transformer (Cluster-GT), which uses node clusters as tokens and employs our proposed N2C-Attn module, shows superior performance on various graph-level tasks.

CNCA: Toward Customizable and Natural Generation of Adversarial Camouflage for Vehicle Detectors
Prior works on physical adversarial camouflage against vehicle detectors mainly focus on the effectiveness and robustness of the attack. The current most successful methods optimize 3D vehicle texture at a pixel level. However, this results in conspicuous and attention-grabbing patterns in the generated camouflage, which humans can easily identify. To address this issue, we propose a Customizable and Natural Camouflage Attack (CNCA) method by leveraging an off-the-shelf pre-trained diffusion model. By sampling the optimal texture image from the diffusion model with a user-specific text prompt, our method can generate natural and customizable adversarial camouflage while maintaining high attack performance. With extensive experiments on the digital and physical worlds and user studies, the results demonstrate that our proposed method can generate significantly more natural-looking camouflage than the state-of-the-art baselines while achieving competitive attack performance.

CODA: A Correlation-Oriented Disentanglement and Augmentation Modeling Scheme for Better Resisting Subpopulation Shifts
Data-driven models learned often struggle to generalize due to widespread subpopulation shifts, especially the presence of both spurious correlations and group imbalance (SC-GI). To learn models more powerful for defending against SC-GI, we propose a {\bf Correlation-Oriented Disentanglement and Augmentation (CODA)} modeling scheme, which includes two unique developments: (1) correlation-oriented disentanglement and (2) strategic sample augmentation with reweighted consistency (RWC) loss. In (1), a bi-branch encoding process is developed to enable the disentangling of variant and invariant correlations by coordinating with a decoy classifier and the decoder reconstruction. In (2), a strategic sample augmentation based on disentangled latent features with RWC loss is designed to reinforce the training of a more generalizable model. The effectiveness of CODA is verified by benchmarking against a set of SOTA models in terms of worst-group accuracy and maximum group accuracy gap based on two famous datasets, ColoredMNIST and CelebA.

CODE: Contrasting Self-generated Description to Combat Hallucination in Large Multi-modal Models
Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities in visual context understanding and coherent response generation. However, alongside these advancements, the issue of hallucinations has emerged as a significant challenge, producing erroneous responses that are unrelated to the visual contents. In this paper, we introduce a novel contrastive-based decoding method, COuntering DEscription Contrastive Decoding (CODE), which leverages self-generated descriptions as contrasting references during the decoding phase of LMMs to address hallucination issues. CODE utilizes the comprehensive descriptions from model itself as visual counterpart to correct and improve response alignment with actual visual content. By dynamically adjusting the information flow and distribution of next-token predictions in the LMM's vocabulary, CODE enhances the coherence and informativeness of generated responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucinations and improves cross-modal consistency across various benchmarks and cutting-edge LMMs. Our method provides a simple yet effective decoding strategy that can be integrated to existing LMM frameworks without additional training.

Coded Computing: A Learning-Theoretic Framework
Coded computing has emerged as a promising framework for tackling significant challenges in large-scale distributed computing, including the presence of slow, faulty, or compromised servers. In this approach, each worker node processes a combination of the data, rather than the raw data itself. The final result then is decoded from the collective outputs of the worker nodes.  However, there is a significant gap between current coded computing approaches and the broader landscape of general distributed computing, particularly when it comes to machine learning workloads. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel foundation for coded computing, integrating the principles of learning theory, and developing a new framework that seamlessly adapts with machine learning applications. In this framework, the objective is to find the encoder and decoder functions that minimize the loss function, defined as the mean squared error between the estimated and true values. Facilitating the search for the optimum decoding and functions, we show that the loss function can be upper-bounded by the summation of two terms: the generalization error of the decoding function and the training error of the encoding function. Focusing on the second-order Sobolev space, we then derive the optimal encoder and decoder. We show that in the proposed solution, the mean squared error of the estimation decays with the rate of $\mathcal{O}(S^4 N^{-3})$ and $\mathcal{O}(S^{\frac{8}{5}}N^{\frac{-3}{5}})$ in noiseless and noisy computation settings, respectively, where $N$ is the number of worker nodes with at most $S$ slow servers (stragglers). Finally, we evaluate the proposed scheme on inference tasks for various machine learning models and demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and rate of convergence.

Coherence-free Entrywise Estimation of Eigenvectors in Low-rank Signal-plus-noise Matrix Models
Spectral methods are widely used to estimate eigenvectors of a low-rank signal matrix subject to noise. These methods use the leading eigenspace of an observed matrix to estimate this low-rank signal. Typically, the entrywise estimation error of these methods depends on the coherence of the low-rank signal matrix with respect to the standard basis. In this work, we present a novel method for eigenvector estimation that avoids this dependence on coherence. Assuming a rank-one signal matrix, under mild technical conditions, the entrywise estimation error of our method provably has no dependence on the coherence under Gaussian noise (i.e., in the spiked Wigner model), and achieves the optimal estimation rate up to logarithmic factors. Simulations demonstrate that our method performs well under non-Gaussian noise and that an extension of our method to the case of a rank-$r$ signal matrix has little to no dependence on the coherence. In addition, we derive new metric entropy bounds for rank-$r$ singular subspaces under $\ell_{2,\infty}$ distance, which may be of independent interest. We use these new bounds to improve the best known lower bound for rank-$r$ eigenspace estimation under $\ell_{2,\infty}$ distance.

Coherent 3D Scene Diffusion From a Single RGB Image
We present a novel diffusion-based approach for coherent 3D scene reconstruction from a single RGB image. Our method utilizes an image-conditioned 3D scene diffusion model to simultaneously denoise the 3D poses and geometries of all objects within the scene.Motivated by the ill-posed nature of the task and to obtain consistent scene reconstruction results, we learn a generative scene prior by conditioning on all scene objects simultaneously to capture scene context and by allowing the model to learn inter-object relationships throughout the diffusion process.We further propose an efficient surface alignment loss to facilitate training even in the absence of full ground-truth annotation, which is common in publicly available datasets. This loss leverages an expressive shape representation, which enables direct point sampling from intermediate shape predictions.By framing the task of single RGB image 3D scene reconstruction as a conditional diffusion process, our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 12.04\% improvement in AP3D on SUN RGB-D and a 13.43\% increase in F-Score on Pix3D.

ColJailBreak: Collaborative Generation and Editing for Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Deep Generation
The commercial text-to-image deep generation models (e.g. DALL·E) can produce high-quality images based on input language descriptions. These models incorporate a black-box safety filter to prevent the generation of unsafe or unethical content, such as violent, criminal, or hateful imagery. Recent jailbreaking methods generate adversarial prompts capable of bypassing safety filters and producing unsafe content, exposing vulnerabilities in influential commercial models. However, once these adversarial prompts are identified, the safety filter can be updated to prevent the generation of unsafe images. In this work, we propose an effective, simple, and difficult-to-detect jailbreaking solution: generating safe content initially with normal text prompts and then editing the generations to embed unsafe content. The intuition behind this idea is that the deep generation model cannot reject safe generation with normal text prompts, while the editing models focus on modifying the local regions of images and do not involve a safety strategy. However, implementing such a solution is non-trivial, and we need to overcome several challenges: how to automatically confirm the normal prompt to replace the unsafe prompts, and how to effectively perform editable replacement and naturally generate unsafe content. In this work, we propose the collaborative generation and editing for jailbreaking text-to-image deep generation (ColJailBreak), which comprises three key components: adaptive normal safe substitution, inpainting-driven injection of unsafe content, and contrastive language-image-guided collaborative optimization. We validate our method on three datasets and compare it to two baseline methods. Our method could generate three unsafe contents through two commercial deep generation models including GPT-4 and DALL·E 2.

Collaboration! Towards Robust Neural Methods for Routing Problems
Despite enjoying desirable efficiency and less reliance on domain expertise, existing neural methods for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) suffer from severe robustness issues — their performance significantly deteriorates on clean instances with crafted perturbations. To enhance robustness, we propose an ensemble-based *Collaborative Neural Framework (CNF)* w.r.t the defense of neural VRP methods, which is crucial yet underexplored in literature. Given a neural VRP method, we adversarially train multiple models in a collaborative manner to synergistically promote robustness against attacks, while boosting standard generalization on clean instances. A neural router is designed to adeptly distribute instances among models, enhancing overall load balancing and collaborative efficacy. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and versatility of CNF in defending against various attacks across different neural VRP methods. Notably, our approach also achieves impressive out-of-distribution generalization performance on real-world benchmark instances.

Collaborative Cognitive Diagnosis with Disentangled Representation Learning
Learners sharing similar implicit cognitive states often display comparable problem-solving performances that are observable. Leveraging collaborative connections among such similar learners proves valuable in comprehending human learning. Motivated by the success of collaborative modeling in various domains, such as recommender systems, we aim to investigate how collaborative signals among learners contribute to the diagnosis of human cognitive states (i.e., knowledge proficiency) in the context of intelligent education. The primary challenges lie in identifying implicit collaborative connections and disentangling the entangled cognitive factors of learners for improved explainability and controllability in cognitive diagnosis (CD). However, in the literature, there has been no work on CD capable of simultaneously modeling collaborative and disentangled cognitive states. To address this gap, we present Coral, a Collaborative Cognitive Diagnosis model with Disentangled Representation Learning. Specifically, Coral first introduces a disentangled state encoder to achieve the initial disentanglement of learners' states. Subsequently, a meticulously designed collaborative representation learning procedure captures collaborative signals. It dynamically constructs a collaborative graph of learners by iteratively searching for optimal neighbors in a context-aware manner. Using the constructed graph, collaborative information is extracted through node representation learning. Finally, a decoding process aligns the initial cognitive states and collaborative states, achieving co-disentanglement with practice performance reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Coral, showcasing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across several real-world datasets.

Collaborative Refining for Learning from Inaccurate Labels
This paper considers the problem of learning from multiple sets of inaccurate labels, which can be easily obtained from low-cost annotators, such as rule-based annotators. Previous works typically concentrate on aggregating information from all the annotators, overlooking the significance of data refinement. This paper presents a collaborative refining approach for learning from inaccurate labels. To refine the data, we introduce the annotator agreement as an instrument, which refers to whether multiple annotators agree or disagree on the labels for a given sample. For samples where some annotators disagree, a comparative strategy is proposed to filter noise. Through theoretical analysis, the connections among multiple sets of labels, the respective models trained on them, and the true labels are uncovered to identify relatively reliable labels. For samples where all annotators agree, an aggregating strategy is designed to mitigate potential noise. Guided by theoretical bounds on loss values, a sample selection criterion is introduced and modified to be more robust against potentially problematic values. Through these two methods, all the samples are refined during training, and these refined samples are used to train a lightweight model simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark and real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our methods.

Color-Oriented Redundancy Reduction in Dataset Distillation
Dataset Distillation (DD) is designed to generate condensed representations of extensive image datasets, enhancing training efficiency. Despite recent advances, there remains considerable potential for improvement, particularly in addressing the notable redundancy within the color space of distilled images. In this paper, we propose a two-fold optimization strategy to minimize color redundancy at the individual image and overall dataset levels, respectively. At the image level, we employ a palette network, a specialized neural network, to dynamically allocate colors from a reduced color space to each pixel. The palette network identifies essential areas in synthetic images for model training, and consequently assigns more unique colors to them. At the dataset level, we develop a color-guided initialization strategy to minimize redundancy among images. Representative images with the least replicated color patterns are selected based on the information gain. A comprehensive performance study involving various datasets and evaluation scenarios is conducted, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed color-aware DD compared to existing DD methods.

CoMat: Aligning Text-to-Image Diffusion Model with Image-to-Text Concept Matching
Diffusion models have demonstrated great success in the field of text-to-image generation. However, alleviating the misalignment between the text prompts and images is still challenging. We break down the problem into two causes: concept ignorance and concept mismapping. To tackle the two challenges, we propose CoMat, an end-to-end diffusion model fine-tuning strategy with the image-to-text concept matching mechanism. Firstly, we introduce a novel image-to-text concept activation module to guide the diffusion model in revisiting ignored concepts. Additionally, an attribute concentration module is proposed to map the text conditions of each entity to its corresponding image area correctly. Extensive experimental evaluations, conducted across three distinct text-to-image alignment benchmarks, demonstrate the superior efficacy of our proposed method, CoMat-SDXL, over the baseline model, SDXL~\cite{podell2023sdxl}. We also show that our method enhances general condition utilization capability and generalizes to the long and complex prompt despite not specifically training on it.

Combining Statistical Depth and Fermat Distance for Uncertainty Quantification
We measure the Out-of-domain uncertainty in the prediction of Neural Networks using a statistical notion called “Lens Depth” (LD) combined with Fermat Distance, which is able to capture precisely the “depth” of a point with respect to a distribution in feature space, without any assumption about the form of distribution. Our method has no trainable parameter. The method is applicable to any classification model as it is applied directly in feature space at test time and does not intervene in training process. As such, it does not impact the performance of the original model. The proposed method gives excellent qualitative result on toy datasets and can give competitive or better uncertainty estimation on standard deep learning datasets compared to strong baseline methods.

CoMERA: Computing- and Memory-Efficient Training via Rank-Adaptive Tensor Optimization
Training large AI models such as deep learning recommendation systems and foundation language (or multi-modal) models costs massive GPUs and computing time. The high training cost has become only affordable to big tech companies, meanwhile also causing increasing concerns about the environmental impact. This paper presents CoMERA, a Computing- and Memory-Efficient training method via Rank-Adaptive tensor optimization. CoMERA achieves end-to-end rank-adaptive tensor-compressed training via a multi-objective optimization formulation, and improves the training to provide both a high compression ratio and excellent accuracy in the training process. Our optimized numerical computation (e.g., optimized tensorized embedding and tensor-vector contractions) and GPU implementation eliminate part of the run-time overhead in the tensorized training on GPU. This leads to, for the first time, $2-3\times$ speedup per training epoch compared with standard training. CoMERA also outperforms the recent GaLore in terms of both memory and computing efficiency. Specifically, CoMERA is $2\times$ faster per training epoch and $9\times$ more memory-efficient than GaLore on a tested six-encoder transformer with single-batch training. With further HPC optimization, CoMERA may significantly reduce the training cost of large language models.

Communication Efficient Distributed Training with Distributed Lion
The Lion optimizer has been a promising competitor with the AdamW for training large AI models, with advantages in memory, computation, and sample efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Distributed Lion, an innovative adaptation of Lion for distributed training environments. Leveraging the sign operator in Lion, our Distributed Lion only requires to communicate binary or lower-precision vectorsbetween workers to the center server, significantly reducing the communication cost.  Our theoretical analysis confirms Distributed Lion's convergence properties. Empirical results demonstrate its robustness across a range of tasks, worker counts, and batch sizes, on both vision and language problems. Notably, Distributed Lion attains comparable performance to standard Lion or AdamW optimizers applied on aggregated gradients, but with significantly reduced communication bandwidth. This feature is particularly advantageous for training large models. In addition, we also demonstrate that \mavolion{} presents a more favorable performance-bandwidth balance compared to existing efficient distributed methods such as deep gradient compression and ternary gradients.

Complete Graphical Criterion for Sequential Covariate Adjustment in Causal Inference
Covariate adjustment, also known as back-door adjustment, is a fundamental tool in causal inference. Although a sound and complete graphical identification criterion, known as  adjustment criterion (Shpitser et al., 2010), exists for static contexts, sequential contexts present challenges. Current practices, such as the sequential back-door adjustment (Pearl and Robins, 1995) or multi-outcome sequential back-door adjustment (Jung et al., 2020), are sound but incomplete; i.e., there are graphical scenarios where the causal effect is expressible via covariate adjustment, yet these criteria do not cover. In this paper, we exemplify this incompleteness, and then presents the sequential adjustment criterion, a sound and complete criterion for sequential covariate adjustment. We provide a constructive sequential adjustment criterion that identifies a set that satisfies the sequential adjustment criterion if and only if the causal effect can be expressed as a sequential covariate adjustment. Finally, we present an algorithm for identifying a minimal sequential covariate adjustment set, which optimizes efficiency by ensuring that no unnecessary vertices are included.

Compositional 3D-aware Video Generation with LLM Director
Significant progress has been made in text-to-video generation through the use of powerful generative models and large-scale internet data. However, substantial challenges remain in precisely controlling individual elements within the generated video, such as the movement and appearance of specific characters and the manipulation of viewpoints. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm that generates each element in 3D representation separately and then composites them with priors from Large Language Models (LLMs) and 2D diffusion models. Specifically, given an input textual query, our scheme consists of four stages: 1) we leverage the LLMs as the director to first decompose the complex query into several sub-queries, where each sub-query describes each element of the generated video; 2) to generate each element, pre-trained models are invoked by the LLMs to obtain the corresponding 3D representation; 3) to composite the generated 3D representations, we prompt multi-modal LLMs to produce coarse guidance on the scale, location, and trajectory of different objects; 4) to make the results adhere to natural distribution, we further leverage 2D diffusion priors and use score distillation sampling to refine the composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate high-fidelity videos from text with flexible control over each element.

Compositional Estimation of Lipschitz Constants for Deep Neural Networks
The Lipschitz constant plays a crucial role in certifying the robustness of neural networks to input perturbations. Since calculating the exact Lipschitz constant is NP-hard, efforts have been made to obtain tight upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant. Typically, this involves solving a large matrix verification problem, the computational cost of which grows significantly for both deeper and wider networks. In this paper, we provide a compositional approach to estimate Lipschitz constants for deep feed-forward neural networks. We first obtain an exact decomposition of the large matrix verification problem into smaller sub-problems. Then, leveraging the underlying cascade structure of the network, we develop two algorithms. The first algorithm explores the geometric features of the problem and enables us to provide a tight Lipschitz constant estimate by solving small semidefinite programs (SDPs) that are only as large as the size of each layer. The second algorithm relaxes these sub-problems and provides a closed-form solution to each sub-problem for extremely fast estimation, altogether eliminating the need to solve SDPs. The two algorithms represent different levels of trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach provides a steep reduction in computation time (as much as several thousand times faster depending on the algorithm for deeper networks) while yielding Lipschitz bounds that are very close to or even better than those achieved by state-of-the-art approaches in a broad range of experiments. In summary, our approach considerably advances the scalability and efficiency of certifying neural network robustness, making it particularly attractive for online learning tasks.

Compositional Generalization Across Distributional Shifts with Sparse Tree Operations
Neural networks continue to struggle with compositional generalization, and this issue is exacerbated by a lack of massive pre-training. One successful approach for developing neural systems which exhibit human-like compositional generalization is $\textit{hybrid}$ neurosymbolic techniques. However, these techniques run into the core issues that plague symbolic approaches to AI: scalability and flexibility. The reason for this failure is that at their core, hybrid neurosymbolic models perform symbolic computation and relegate the scalable and flexible neural computation to parameterizing a symbolic system. We investigate a $\textit{unified}$ neurosymbolic system where transformations in the network can be interpreted simultaneously as both symbolic and neural computation. We extend a unified neurosymbolic architecture called the Differentiable Tree Machine in two central ways. First, we significantly increase the model’s efficiency through the use of sparse vector representations of symbolic structures. Second, we enable its application beyond the restricted set of tree2tree problems to the more general class of seq2seq problems. The improved model retains its prior generalization capabilities and, since there is a fully neural path through the network, avoids the pitfalls of other neurosymbolic techniques that elevate symbolic computation over neural computation.

Compositional PAC-Bayes: Generalization of GNNs with persistence and beyond
Descriptors based on Persistent Homology (PH) are being increasingly integrated into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to augment them with rich topological features. However, the generalization of PH schemes remains unexplored. The heterogeneity of GNN layers and persistent vectorization components poses further key challenges in analyzing the generalization behavior of the overall model.  We introduce a novel _compositional_ PAC-Bayes framework to accommodate a broad spectrum of models including those with heterogeneous layers, providing the first data-dependent generalization bounds for a widely adopted PH vectorization scheme (that subsumes persistence landscapes, images, and silhouettes) as well as persistence-augmented GNNs. Our bounds also inform the design of novel regularizers. Existing bounds for GNNs and neural nets are recovered with ease. Empirical evaluations on several standard real-world datasets demonstrate that our bounds accurately predict the generalization performance, leading to improved classifier design via our regularizers. Overall, this work bridges a crucial gap in the theoretical understanding of PH methods and general heterogeneous models, paving the way for the  design of better models for (graph) representation learning.

Compressive Sensing with Sparsity Inducing Conditionally Gaussian Generative Models
This work addresses the fundamental linear inverse problem in compressive sensing (CS) by introducing a new type of regularizing generative prior. Our proposed method utilizes ideas from classical dictionary-based CS to integrate a strong regularization towards sparse solutions. At the same time, by leveraging the notion of conditional Gaussianity, it also incorporates the adaptability to training data and is able to learn from a few compressed and noisy data samples. We support our approach theoretically through the concept of variational inference and validate it empirically using different types of compressible signals.

Computational Aspects of Bayesian Persuasion under Approximate Best Response
We study Bayesian persuasion under approximate best response, where the receiver may choose any action that is not too much suboptimal, given their posterior belief upon receiving the signal.  We focus on the computational aspects of the problem, aiming to design algorithms that efficiently compute (almost) optimal strategies for the sender.  Despite the absence of the revelation principle --- which has been one of the most powerful tools in Bayesian persuasion --- we design polynomial-time exact algorithms for the problem when either the state space or the action space is small, as well as a quasi-polynomial-time approximation scheme (QPTAS) for the general problem.  On the negative side, we show there is no polynomial-time exact algorithm for the general problem unless $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$.  Our results build on several new algorithmic ideas, which might be useful in other principal-agent problems where robustness is desired.

Computation-Aware Gaussian Processes: Model Selection And Linear-Time Inference
Model selection in Gaussian processes scales prohibitively with the size of the training dataset, both in time and memory.While many approximations exist, all incur inevitable approximation error.Recent work accounts for this error in the form of computational uncertainty, which enables---at the cost of quadratic complexity---an explicit tradeoff between computation and precision.Here we extend this development to model selection, which requires significant enhancements to the existing approach, including linear-time scaling in the size of the dataset.We propose a novel training loss for hyperparameter optimization and demonstrate empirically that the resulting method can outperform SGPR and SVGP, state-of-the-art methods for GP model selection, on medium to large-scale datasets.Our experiments show that model selection for computation-aware GPs trained on 1.8 million data points can be done within a few hours on a single GPU.As a result of this work, Gaussian processes can be trained on large-scale datasets without compromising their ability to quantify uncertainty---a fundamental prerequisite for optimal decision-making.

Computerized Adaptive Testing via Collaborative Ranking
As machine learning advances in the realm of intelligent education, Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) has garnered significant attention. CAT is recognized as an efficient testing methodology capable of accurately estimating a student's ability with a minimal number of questions. Compared to traditional paper-and-pencil tests, CAT has been shown to require fewer questions to achieve the same level of precision in ability estimation, leading to its widespread adoption in mainstream selective exams such as the GMAT and GRE. While all CAT methods have traditionally prioritized accurate ability estimation, the practical performance of current SOTA approaches in student ranking has been notably deficient, particularly in scenarios where student ranking is crucial (e.g., high-stakes exams). This paper addresses the inconsistency issue in CAT ranking by emphasizing the importance of aligning test outcomes with students' true underlying abilities. Departing from the conventional independent testing paradigm among students, this paper introduces a collaborative method that leverages inter-student information to enhance student ranking. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Collaborative Computerized Adaptive Testing (CCAT) framework. CCAT uses collaborative students  as anchors to assist in ranking test-takers, offering both theoretical guarantees and experimental validation for ensuring ranking consistency.

Computing the Bias of Constant-step Stochastic Approximation with Markovian Noise
We study stochastic approximation algorithms with Markovian noise and constant step-size $\alpha$. We develop a method based on infinitesimal generator comparisons to study the bias of the algorithm, which is the expected difference between $\theta_n$ ---the value at iteration $n$--- and $\theta^*$ ---the unique equilibrium of the corresponding ODE. We show that, under some smoothness conditions, this bias is of order $O(\alpha)$. Furthermore, we show that the time-averaged bias is equal to $\alpha V + O(\alpha^2)$, where $V$ is a constant characterized by a Lyapunov equation, showing that $E[\bar{\theta}_n] \approx \theta^*+V\alpha + O(\alpha^2)$, where $\bar{\theta}_n$ is the Polyak-Ruppert average.  We also show that $\bar{\theta}_n$ converges with high probability around $\theta^*+\alpha V$. We illustrate how to combine this with Richardson-Romberg extrapolation to derive an iterative scheme with a bias of order $O(\alpha^2)$.

ConceptFactory: Facilitate 3D Object Knowledge Annotation with Object Conceptualization
We present ConceptFactory, a novel scope to facilitate more efficient annotation of 3D object knowledge by recognizing 3D objects through generalized concepts (i.e. object conceptualization), aiming at promoting machine intelligence to learn comprehensive object knowledge from both vision and robotics aspects. This idea originates from the findings in human cognition research that the perceptual recognition of objects can be explained as a process of arranging generalized geometric components (e.g. cuboids and cylinders). ConceptFactory consists of two critical parts: i) ConceptFactory Suite, a unified toolbox that adopts Standard Concept Template Library (STL-C) to drive a web-based platform for object conceptualization, and ii) ConceptFactory Asset, a large collection of conceptualized objects acquired using ConceptFactory suite. Our approach enables researchers to effortlessly acquire or customize extensive varieties of object knowledge to comprehensively study different object understanding tasks. We validate our idea on a wide range of benchmark tasks from both vision and robotics aspects with state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating the high quality and versatility of annotations provided by our approach. See more information in the supplementary material.

Conditional Controllable Image Fusion
Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multiple input images acquired through various sensors or optical devices to synthesize a new image containing richer information. Existing methods usually employ distinct constraint designs tailored to specific scenes, forming fixed fusion paradigms. However, such data-driven fusion methods are hardly applicable to all scenarios, especially in rapidly changing environments. To address this issue, we first propose a conditional controllable fusion (CCF) framework for general image fusion tasks without specific training. Due to the dynamic differences of different samples, CCF employs specific fusion constraints for each individual in practice. Given the denoising diffusion model's tremendous reconstruction capacity, we inject the specific constraints into the pre-trained DDPM as adaptive fusion conditions. The appropriate conditions are dynamically selected to ensure the fusion process remains responsive to the specific requirements in the reverse diffusion stage. Thus, CCF enables conditionally calibrating the fused images step by step. Extensive experiments validate our effectiveness in general fusion tasks across diverse scenarios against the competing methods without additional training.

Conditional Density Estimation with Histogram Trees
Conditional density estimation (CDE) goes beyond regression by modeling the full conditional distribution, providing a richer understanding of the data than just the conditional mean in regression. This makes CDE particularly useful in critical application domains. However, interpretable CDE methods are understudied. Current methods typically employ kernel-based approaches, using kernel functions directly for kernel density estimation or as basis functions in linear models. In contrast, despite their conceptual simplicity and visualization suitability, tree-based methods---which are arguably more comprehensible---have been largely overlooked for CDE tasks. Thus, we propose the Conditional Density Tree (CDTree), a fully non-parametric model consisting of a decision tree in which each leaf is formed by a histogram model. Specifically, we formalize the problem of learning a CDTree using the minimum description length (MDL) principle, which eliminates the need for tuning the hyperparameter for regularization. Next, we propose an iterative algorithm that, although greedily, searches the optimal histogram for every possible node split. Our experiments demonstrate that, in comparison to existing interpretable CDE methods, CDTrees are both more accurate (as measured by the log-loss) and more robust against irrelevant features. Further, our approach leads to smaller tree sizes than existing tree-based models, which benefits interpretability.

Conditional Generative Models are Sufficient to Sample from Any Causal Effect Estimand
Causal inference from observational data has recently found many applications in machine learning. While sound and complete algorithms exist to compute causal effects, many of them assume access to conditional likelihoods, which is difficult to estimate for high-dimensional (particularly image) data. Researchers have alleviated this issue by simulating causal relations with neural models. However, no existing works can effectively deal with causal graphs on image data containing latent confounders, or obtain conditional interventional samples. In this work, we show how to sample from any identifiable interventional distribution given an arbitrary causal graph through a sequence of push-forward computations of conditional generative models, such as diffusion models. Our proposed algorithm follows the recursive steps of the existing likelihood-based identification algorithms to train a set of feed-forward models, and connect them in a specific way to sample from the desired distribution. We conduct experiments on a Colored MNIST dataset having both the treatment ($X$) and the target variables ($Y$) as images and sample from $P(y|do(x))$. Our algorithm also enables us to conduct a causal analysis to evaluate spurious correlations among input features of generative models pre-trained on the CelebA dataset. Finally, we generate high-dimensional interventional samples from the MIMIC-CXR dataset involving text and image variables.

Conformal Classification with Equalized Coverage for Adaptively Selected Groups
This paper introduces a conformal inference method to evaluate uncertainty in classification by generating prediction sets with valid coverage conditional on adaptively chosen features. These features are carefully selected to reflect potential model limitations or biases. This can be useful to find a practical compromise between efficiency---by providing informative predictions---and algorithmic fairness---by ensuring equalized coverage for the most sensitive groups. We demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of this method on simulated and real data sets.

Conformal Inverse Optimization
Inverse optimization has been increasingly used to estimate unknown parameters in an optimization model based on decision data. We show that such a point estimation is insufficient in a prescriptive setting where the estimated parameters are used to prescribe new decisions. The prescribed decisions may be low-quality and misaligned with human intuition and thus are unlikely to be adopted. To tackle this challenge, we propose conformal inverse optimization, which seeks to learn an uncertainty set for the unknown parameters and then solve a robust optimization model to prescribe new decisions. Under mild assumptions, we show that our method enjoys provable guarantees on solution quality, as evaluated using both the ground-truth parameters and the decision maker's perception of the unknown parameters. Our method demonstrates strong empirical performance compared to classic inverse optimization. Data and source code are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ConformalIO-B776.

Conformalized Credal Set Predictors
Credal sets are sets of probability distributions that are considered as candidates for an imprecisely known ground-truth distribution. In machine learning, they have recently attracted attention as an appealing formalism for uncertainty representation, in particular due to their ability to represent both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a prediction. However, the design of methods for learning credal set predictors remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we make use of conformal prediction for this purpose. More specifically, we propose a method for predicting credal sets in the classification task, given training data labeled by probability distributions. Since our method inherits the coverage guarantees of conformal prediction, our conformal credal sets are guaranteed to be valid with high probability (without any assumptions on model or distribution). We demonstrate the applicability of our method on ambiguous classification tasks for uncertainty quantification.

Conformalized Multiple Testing after Data-dependent Selection
The task of distinguishing individuals of interest from a vast pool of candidates using predictive models has garnered significant attention in recent years. This task can be framed as a *conformalized multiple testing* procedure, which aims at quantifying prediction uncertainty by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) via conformal inference. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of conformalized multiple testing after data-dependent selection procedures. To guarantee the construction of valid test statistics that accurately capture the distorted distribution resulting from the selection process, we leverage a holdout labeled set to closely emulate the selective distribution. Our approach involves adaptively picking labeled data to create a calibration set based on the stability of the selection rule. This strategy ensures that the calibration data and the selected test unit are exchangeable, allowing us to develop valid conformal p-values. Implementing with the famous Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, it effectively controls the FDR over the selected subset. To handle the randomness of the selected subset and the dependence among the constructed p-values, we establish a unified theoretical framework. This framework extends the application of conformalized multiple testing to complex selective settings. Furthermore, we conduct numerical studies to showcase the effectiveness and validity of our procedures across various scenarios.

Conformal Prediction for Class-wise Coverage via Augmented Label Rank Calibration
Conformal prediction (CP) is an emerging uncertainty quantification framework that allows us to construct a prediction set to cover the true label with a pre-specified marginal or conditional probability.Although the valid coverage guarantee has been extensively studied for classification problems, CP often produces large prediction sets which may not be practically useful.This issue is exacerbated for the setting of class-conditional coverage on imbalanced classification tasks.This paper proposes the Rank Calibrated Class-conditional CP (RC3P) algorithm to reduce the prediction set sizes to achieve class-conditional coverage, where the valid coverage holds for each class.In contrast to the standard class-conditional CP (CCP) method that uniformly thresholds the class-wise conformity score for each class, the augmented label rank calibration step allows RC3P to selectively iterate this class-wise thresholding subroutine only for a subset of classes whose class-wise top-$k$ error is small.We prove that agnostic to the classifier and data distribution, RC3P achieves class-wise coverage. We also show that RC3P reduces the size of prediction sets compared to the CCP method. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that RC3P achieves class-wise coverage and  $26.25\\%$ $\downarrow$ reduction in prediction set sizes on average.

Confusion-Resistant Federated Learning via Diffusion-Based Data Harmonization on Non-IID Data
Federated learning has become a pivotal distributed learning paradigm, involving collaborative model updates across multiple nodes with private data. However, handling non-i.i.d. (not identically and independently distributed) data and ensuring model consistency across heterogeneous environments present significant challenges. These challenges often lead to model performance degradation and increased difficulty in achieving effective communication among participant models. In this work, we propose Confusion-Resistant Federated Learning via Consistent Diffusion (CRFed), a novel framework designed to address these issues. Our approach introduces a new diffusion-based data harmonization mechanism that includes data augmentation, noise injection, and iterative denoising to ensure consistent model updates across non-i.i.d. data distributions. This mechanism aims to reduce data distribution disparities among participating nodes, enhancing the coordination and consistency of model updates. Moreover, we design a confusion-resistant strategy leveraging an indicator function and adaptive learning rate adjustment to mitigate the adverse effects of data heterogeneity and model inconsistency. Specifically, we calculate importance sampling weights based on the optimal sampling probability, which guides the selection of clients and the sampling of their data, ensuring that model updates are robust and aligned across different nodes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and NIPD, demonstrate the effectiveness of CRFed in improving accuracy, convergence speed, and overall robustness in federated learning scenarios with severe data heterogeneity.

Conjugate Bayesian Two-step Change Point Detection for Hawkes Process
The Bayesian two-step change point detection method is popular for the Hawkes process due to its simplicity and intuitiveness. However, the non-conjugacy between the point process likelihood and the prior requires most existing Bayesian two-step change point detection methods to rely on non-conjugate inference methods. These methods lack analytical expressions, leading to low computational efficiency and impeding timely change point detection. To address this issue, this work employs data augmentation to propose a conjugate Bayesian two-step change point detection method for the Hawkes process, which proves to be more accurate and efficient. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our method compared to baseline methods. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to explore the robustness of our method concerning various hyperparameters.

Connecting Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture with Contrastive Self-supervised Learning
In recent advancements in unsupervised visual representation learning, the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has emerged as a significant method for extracting visual features from unlabeled imagery through an innovative masking strategy. Despite its success, two primary limitations have been identified: the inefficacy of Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from I-JEPA in preventing entire collapse and the inadequacy of I-JEPA prediction in accurately learning the mean of patch representations. Addressing these challenges, this study introduces a novel framework, namely C-JEPA (Contrastive-JEPA), which integrates the Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture with the Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) strategy. This integration is designed to effectively learn the variance/covariance for preventing entire collapse and ensuring invariance in the mean of augmented views, thereby overcoming the identified limitations. Through empirical and theoretical evaluations, our work demonstrates that C-JEPA significantly enhances the stability and quality of visual representation learning. When pre-trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset, C-JEPA exhibits rapid and improved convergence in both linear probing and fine-tuning performance metrics.

Connectivity-Driven Pseudo-Labeling Makes Stronger Cross-Domain Segmenters
Presently, pseudo-labeling stands as a prevailing approach in cross-domain semantic segmentation, enhancing model efficacy by training with pixels assigned with reliable pseudo-labels.  However, we identify two key limitations within this paradigm: (1) under relatively severe domain shifts, most selected reliable pixels appear speckled and remain noisy. (2) when dealing with wild data, some pixels belonging to the open-set class may exhibit high confidence and also appear speckled. These two points make it difficult for the pixel-level selection mechanism to identify and correct these speckled close- and open-set noises. As a result, error accumulation is continuously introduced into subsequent self-training, leading to inefficiencies in pseudo-labeling. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Semantic Connectivity-driven Pseudo-labeling (SeCo).  SeCo formulates pseudo-labels at the connectivity level, which makes it easier to locate and correct closed and open set noise. Specifically, SeCo comprises two key components: Pixel Semantic Aggregation (PSA) and Semantic Connectivity Correction (SCC). Initially, PSA categorizes semantics into ``stuff'' and ``things'' categories and aggregates speckled pseudo-labels into semantic connectivity through efficient interaction with the Segment Anything Model (SAM).  This enables us not only to obtain accurate boundaries but also simplifies noise localization. Subsequently, SCC introduces a simple connectivity classification task, which enables us to locate and correct connectivity noise with the guidance of loss distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeCo can be flexibly applied to various cross-domain semantic segmentation tasks, \textit{i.e.} domain generalization and domain adaptation,  even including source-free, and black-box domain adaptation, significantly improving the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is provided in the appendix and will be open-source.

Connectivity Shapes Implicit Regularization in Matrix Factorization Models for Matrix Completion
Matrix factorization models have been extensively studied as a valuable test-bed for understanding the implicit biases of overparameterized models. Although both low nuclear norm and low rank regularization have been studied for these models, a unified understanding of when, how, and why they achieve different implicit regularization effects remains elusive. In this work, we systematically investigate the implicit regularization of matrix factorization for solving matrix completion problems. We empirically discover that the connectivity of observed data plays a key role in the implicit bias, with a transition from low nuclear norm to low rank as data shifts from disconnected to connected with increased observations. We identify a hierarchy of intrinsic invariant manifolds in the loss landscape that guide the training trajectory to evolve from low-rank to higher-rank solutions. Based on this finding, we theoretically characterize the training trajectory as following the hierarchical invariant manifold traversal process, generalizing the characterization of Li et al.(2020)  to include the disconnected case. Furthermore, we establish conditions that guarantee minimum nuclear norm, closely aligning with our experimental findings, and we provide a dynamics characterization condition for ensuring minimum rank. Our work reveals the intricate interplay between data connectivity, training dynamics, and implicit regularization in matrix factorization models.

Consensus Learning with Deep Sets for Essential Matrix Estimation
Robust estimation of the essential matrix, which encodes the relative position and orientation of two cameras, is a fundamental step in structure from motion pipelines. Recent deep-based methods achieved accurate estimation by using complex network architectures that involve graphs, attention layers, and hard pruning steps. Here, we propose a simpler network architecture based on Deep Sets. Given a collection of point matches extracted from two images, our method identifies outlier point matches and models the displacement noise in inlier matches. A weighted DLT module uses these predictions to regress the essential matrix. Our network achieves accurate recovery that is superior to existing networks with significantly more complex architectures.

Consistency Diffusion Bridge Models
Diffusion models (DMs) have become the dominant paradigm of generative modeling in a variety of domains by learning stochastic processes from noise to data. Recently, diffusion denoising bridge models (DDBMs), a new family of generative models that build stochastic processes between fixed data endpoints based on a reference diffusion process, have achieved empirical success across tasks with coupled data distribution, such as image-to-image translation. However, DDBM's sampling process typically requires hundreds of network evaluations to achieve decent performance, which may impede their practical deployment due to high computational demands. In this work, inspired by the recent advance of consistency models in DMs, we tackle this problem by learning the consistency function of the probability-flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) of DDBMs, which directly predicts the solution at a starting step given any point on the ODE trajectory. Based on a dedicated general-form ODE solver, we propose two paradigms: consistency bridge distillation and consistency bridge training, which is flexible to apply on DDBMs with broad design choices. Experimental results show that our proposed method could sample $4\times$ to $50\times$ faster than the base DDBM and produce better visual quality given the same step in various tasks with pixel resolution ranging from $64 \times 64$ to $256 \times 256$, as well as supporting downstream tasks such as semantic interpolation in the data space.

Consistency of Neural Causal Partial Identification
Recent progress in Neural Causal Models (NCMs) showcased how identification and partial identification of causal effects can be automatically carried out via training of neural generative models that respect the constraints encoded in a given causal graph [Xia et al. 2022, Balazadeh et al. 2022]. However, formal consistency of these methods has only been proven for the case of discrete variables or only for linear causal models. In this work, we prove consistency of partial identification via NCMs in a general setting with both continuous and categorical variables. Further, our results highlight the impact of the design of the underlying neural network architecture in terms of depth and connectivity as well as the importance of applying Lipschitz regularization in the training phase. In particular, we provide a counterexample showing that without Lipschitz regularization the NCM may not be asymptotically consistent. Our results are enabled by new results on the approximability of structural causal models via neural generative models, together with an analysis of the sample complexity of the resulting architectures and how that translates into an error in the constrained optimization problem that defines the partial identification bounds.

Consistency Purification: Effective and Efficient Diffusion Purification towards Certified Robustness
Diffusion Purification, purifying noised images with diffusion models, has been widely used for enhancing certified robustness via randomized smoothing. However, existing frameworks often grapple with the balance between efficiency and effectiveness. While the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) offers an efficient single-step purification, it falls short in ensuring purified images reside on the data manifold. Conversely, the Stochastic Diffusion Model effectively places purified images on the data manifold but demands solving cumbersome stochastic differential equations, while its derivative, the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE), though solving simpler ordinary differential equations, still requires multiple computational steps. In this work, we demonstrated that an ideal purification pipeline should generate the purified images on the data manifold that are as much semantically aligned to the original images for effectiveness in one step for efficiency. Therefore, we introduced Consistency Purification, an efficiency-effectiveness Pareto superior purifier compared to the previous work. Consistency Purification employs the consistency model, a one-step generative model distilled from PF-ODE, thus can generate on-manifold purified images with a single network evaluation. However, the consistency model is designed not for purification thus it does not inherently ensure semantic alignment between purified and original images. To resolve this issue, we further refine it through Consistency Fine-tuning with LPIPS loss, which enables more aligned semantic meaning while keeping the purified images on data manifold. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our Consistency Purification framework achieves state-of-the-art certified robustness and efficiency compared to baseline methods.

Constant Acceleration Flow
Rectified flow and reflow procedures have significantly advanced fast generation by progressively straightening ordinary differential equation (ODE) flows under the assumption that image and noise pairs, known as coupling, can be approximated by straight trajectories with constant velocity. However, we observe that the constant velocity modeling and reflow procedures have limitations in accurately learning to couple with flow crossing, leading to suboptimal few-step generation. To overcome the limitations, we introduce the Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF), a novel framework based on a simple constant acceleration equation. Additionally, we propose two techniques to improve estimation accuracy: initial velocity conditioning for the acceleration model and a reflow process for the initial velocity. Our comparative studies show that CAF not only outperforms rectified flow with reflow procedures in terms of speed and accuracy but also demonstrates substantial improvements in preserving coupling for fast generation.

Constrained Adaptive Attack: Effective Adversarial Attack Against Deep Neural Networks for Tabular Data
State-of-the-art deep learning models for tabular data have recently achieved acceptable performance to be deployed in industrial settings. However, the robustness of these models remains scarcely explored. Contrary to computer vision, there are no effective attacks to properly evaluate the adversarial robustness of deep tabular models due to intrinsic properties of tabular data, such as categorical features, immutability, and feature relationship constraints. To fill this gap, we first propose CAPGD, a gradient attack that overcomes the failures of existing gradient attacks with adaptive mechanisms. This new attack does not require parameter tuning and further degrades the accuracy, up to 81\% points compared to the previous gradient attacks. Second, we design CAA, an efficient evasion attack that combines our CAPGD attack and MOEVA, the best search-based attack.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks on five architectures and four critical use cases. Our empirical study demonstrates that CAA outperforms all existing attacks in 17 over the 20 settings, and leads to a drop in the accuracy by up to 96.1\% points and 21.9\% points compared to CAPGD and MOEVA respectively while being up to five times faster than MOEVA. Given the effectiveness and efficiency of our new attacks, we argue that they should become the minimal test for any new defense or robust architectures in tabular machine learning.

Constrained Binary Decision Making
Binary statistical decision making involves choosing between two states based on statistical evidence. The optimal decision strategy is typically formulated through a constrained optimization problem, where both the objective and constraints are expressed as integrals involving two Lebesgue measurable functions, one of which represents the strategy being optimized. In this work, we present a comprehensive formulation of the binary decision making problem and provide a detailed characterization of the optimal solution. Our framework encompasses a wide range of well-known and recently proposed decision making problems as specific cases. We demonstrate how our generic approach can be used to derive the optimal decision strategies for these diverse instances. Our results offer a robust mathematical tool that simplifies the process of solving both existing and novel formulations of binary decision making problems which are in the core of many Machine Learning algorithms.

Constrained Diffusion Models via Dual Training
Diffusion models have attained prominence for their ability to synthesize a probability distribution for a given dataset via a diffusion process,  enabling the generation of new data points with high fidelity. However, diffusion processes are prone to generating biased data based on the training dataset. To address this issue, we develop constrained diffusion models by imposing diffusion constraints based on desired distributions that are informed by requirements. Specifically, we cast the training of diffusion models under requirements as a constrained distribution optimization problem that aims to reduce the distribution difference between original and generated data while obeying constraints on the distribution of generated data. We show that our constrained diffusion models generate new data from a mixture data distribution that achieves the optimal trade-off among objective and constraints. To train constrained diffusion models, we develop a dual training algorithm and characterize the optimality of the trained constrained diffusion model. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our constrained diffusion models in two constrained generation tasks: (i) we consider a dataset with one or more underrepresented classes where we train the model with constraints to ensure fairly sampling from all classes during inference; (ii) we fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model to sample from a new dataset while avoiding overfitting using constraints.

Constrained Diffusion with Trust Sampling
Diffusion models have demonstrated significant promise in various generative tasks; however, they often struggle to satisfy challenging constraints. Our approach addresses this limitation by rethinking training-free loss-guided diffusion from an optimization perspective. We formulate a series of constrained optimizations throughout the inference process of a diffusion model. In each optimization, we allow the sample to take multiple steps along the gradient of the proxy constraint function until we can no longer trust the proxy, according to the variance at each diffusion level. Additionally, we estimate the state manifold of diffusion model to allow for early termination when the sample starts to wander away from the state manifold at each diffusion step. Trust sampling effectively balances between following the unconditional diffusion model and adhering to the loss guidance, enabling more flexible and accurate constrained generation.  We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments on complex tasks, and in drastically different domains of images and 3D motion generation, showing significant improvements over existing methods in terms of generation quality.

Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo
We consider the problem of sampling from a probability distribution know up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can enforce moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or desiderata such as prediction fairness. As opposed to support constraints, methods based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties are not suited for this task. We therefore turn to gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under typical assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in multiple applications.

Constrained Synthesis with Projected Diffusion Models
This paper introduces an approach to endow generative diffusion processes the ability to satisfy and certify compliance with constraints and physical principles. The proposed method recast the traditional sampling process of generative diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem, steering the generated data distribution to remain within a specified region to ensure adherence to the given constraints.These capabilities are validated on applications featuring both convex and challenging, non-convex, constraints as well as ordinary differential equations, in domains spanning from synthesizing new materials with precise morphometric properties, generating physics-informed motion, optimizing paths in planning scenarios, and human motion synthesis.

ContactField: Implicit Field Representation for Multi-Person Interaction Geometry
We introduce a novel implicit field representation tailored for multi-person interaction geometry in 3D spaces, capable of simultaneously reconstructing occupancy, instance identification (ID) tags, and contact fields. Volumetric representation of interacting people presents substantial challenges, including inaccurately captured geometries, varying degrees of occlusions, and data scarcity. Existing multi-view methods, which either reconstruct each subject in isolation or merge nearby 3D surfaces as a single unified mesh, often fail to capture the intricate geometry among interacting instances and exploit datasets with views and a small group of people for training. Our approach utilizes an implicit representation for interaction geometry contextualized by a transformer-based multi-view fusion module. This module adeptly aggregates both local and global information from individual views and interacting groups, enabling precise modeling of close physical interactions through dense point retrieval in small areas supported by the implicit fields. Furthermore, we develop a synthetic dataset encompassing diverse multi-person interaction scenarios to enhance the robustness of our geometry estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method for accurately reconstructing human geometries and ID tags within three-dimensional spaces, outperforming conventional multi-view techniques. Notably, our method facilitates unsupervised estimation of contact points without the need for specific training data on contact supervision.

Context and Geometry Aware Voxel Transformer for Semantic Scene Completion
Vision-based Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained much attention due to its widespread applications in various 3D perception tasks. Existing sparse-to-dense approaches typically employ shared context-independent queries across various input images, which fails to capture distinctions among them as the focal regions of different inputs vary and may result in undirected feature aggregation of cross attention. Additionally, the absence of depth information may lead to points projected onto the image plane sharing the same 2D position or similar sampling points in the feature map, resulting in depth ambiguity. In this paper, we present a novel context and geometry aware voxel transformer. It utilizes a context aware query generator to initialize context-dependent queries tailored to individual input images, effectively capturing their unique characteristics and aggregating information within the region of interest. Furthermore, it extend deformable cross-attention from 2D to 3D pixel space, enabling the differentiation of points with similar image coordinates based on their depth coordinates. Building upon this module, we introduce a neural network named CGFormer to achieve semantic scene completion. Simultaneously, CGFormer leverages multiple 3D representations (i.e., voxel and TPV) to boost the semantic and geometric representation abilities of the transformed 3D volume from both local and global perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate that CGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, attaining a mIoU of 16.87 and 20.05, as well as an IoU of 45.99 and 48.07, respectively. Remarkably, CGFormer even outperforms approaches employing temporal images as inputs or much larger image backbone networks. Code for the proposed method is available.

Contextual Active Model Selection
While training models and labeling data are resource-intensive, a wealth of pre-trained models and unlabeled data exists. To effectively utilize these resources, we present an approach to actively select pre-trained models while minimizing labeling costs. We frame this as an online contextual active model selection problem: At each round, the learner receives an unlabeled data point as a context. The objective is to adaptively select the best model to make a prediction while limiting label requests. To tackle this problem, we propose CAMS, a contextual active model selection algorithm that relies on two novel components: (1) a contextual model selection mechanism, which leverages context information to make informed decisions about which model is likely to perform best for a given context, and (2)an active query component, which strategically chooses when to request labels for data points, minimizing the overall labeling cost. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis for the regret and query complexity under both adversarial and stochastic settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on a diverse collection of benchmark classification tasks. Notably, CAMS requires substantially less labeling effort (less than 10%) compared to existing methods on CIFAR10 and DRIFT benchmarks, while achieving similar or better accuracy.

Continual Audio-Visual Sound Separation
In this paper, we introduce a novel continual audio-visual sound separation task, aiming to continuously separate sound sources for new classes while preserving performance on previously learned classes, with the aid of visual guidance. This problem is crucial for practical visually guided auditory perception as it can significantly enhance the adaptability and robustness of audio-visual sound separation models, making them more applicable for real-world scenarios where encountering new sound sources is commonplace. The task is inherently challenging as our models must not only effectively utilize information from both modalities in current tasks but also preserve their cross-modal association in old tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during audio-visual continual learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach named ContAV-Sep (Continual Audio-Visual Sound Separation). ContAV-Sep presents a novel Cross-modal Similarity Distillation Constraint (CrossSDC) to uphold the cross-modal semantic similarity through incremental tasks and retain previously acquired knowledge of semantic similarity in old models, mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. The CrossSDC can seamlessly integrate into the training process of different audio-visual sound separation frameworks. Experiments demonstrate that ContAV-Sep can effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and achieve significantly better performance compared to other continual learning baselines for audio-visual sound separation. $\textit{Our source code and pre-trained models will be released.}$

Continual Learning in the Frequency Domain
Continual learning (CL) is designed to learn new tasks while preserving existing knowledge. Replaying samples from earlier tasks has proven to be an effective method to mitigate the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. However, the current research on the training efficiency of rehearsal-based methods is insufficient, which limits the practical application of CL systems in resource-limited scenarios. The human visual system (HVS) exhibits varying sensitivities to different frequency components, enabling the efficient elimination of visually redundant information. Inspired by HVS, we propose a novel framework called Continual Learning in the Frequency Domain (CLFD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize frequency domain features to enhance the performance and efficiency of CL training on edge devices. For the input features of the feature extractor, CLFD employs wavelet transform to map the original input image into the frequency domain, thereby effectively reducing the size of input feature maps. Regarding the output features of the feature extractor, CLFD selectively utilizes output features for distinct classes for classification, thereby balancing the reusability and interference of output features based on the frequency domain similarity of the classes across various tasks. Optimizing only the input and output features of the feature extractor allows for seamless integration of CLFD with various rehearsal-based methods. Extensive experiments conducted in both cloud and edge environments demonstrate that CLFD consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both precision and training efficiency. Specifically, CLFD can increase the accuracy of the SOTA CL method by up to 6.83% and reduce the training time by 2.6×.

Continuous Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Recognition
Long-tailed semi-supervised learning poses a significant challenge in training models with limited labeled data exhibiting a long-tailed label distribution. Current state-of-the-art LTSSL approaches heavily rely on high-quality pseudo-labels for large-scale unlabeled data. However, these methods often neglect the impact of representations learned by the neural network and struggle with real-world unlabeled data, which typically follows a different distribution than labeled data. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic framework that unifies various recent proposals in long-tail learning. Our framework derives the class-balanced contrastive loss through Gaussian kernel density estimation. We introduce a continuous contrastive learning method, CCL, extending our framework to unlabeled data using *reliable* and *smoothed* pseudo-labels. By progressively estimating the underlying label distribution and optimizing its alignment with model predictions, we tackle the diverse distribution of unlabeled data in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets with varying unlabeled data distributions demonstrate that CCL consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 4% improvement on the ImageNet-127 dataset. The supplementary material includes the source code for reproducibility.

Continuously Learning, Adapting, and Improving: A Dual-Process Approach to Autonomous Driving
Autonomous driving has advanced significantly due to sensors, machine learning, and artificial intelligence improvements. However, prevailing methods struggle with intricate scenarios and causal relationships, hindering adaptability and interpretability in varied environments. To address the above problems, we introduce LeapAD, a novel paradigm for autonomous driving inspired by the human cognitive process. Specifically, LeapAD emulates human attention by selecting critical objects relevant to driving decisions, simplifying environmental interpretation, and mitigating decision-making complexities. Additionally, LeapAD incorporates an innovative dual-process decision-making module, which consists of an Analytic Process (System-II) for thorough analysis and reasoning, along with a Heuristic Process (System-I) for swift and empirical processing. The Analytic Process leverages its logical reasoning to accumulate linguistic driving experience, which is then transferred to the Heuristic Process by supervised fine-tuning. Through reflection mechanisms and a growing memory bank, LeapAD continuously improves itself from past mistakes in a closed-loop environment. Closed-loop testing in CARLA shows that LeapAD outperforms all methods relying solely on camera input, requiring 1-2 orders of magnitude less labeled data. Experiments also demonstrate that as the memory bank expands, the Heuristic Process with only 1.8B parameters can inherit the knowledge from a GPT-4 powered Analytic Process and achieve continuous performance improvement. Our project page is available at: https://leapad-2024.github.io/LeapAD.

Continuous Partitioning for Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning
Laplace learning algorithms for graph-based semi-supervised learning have been shown to produce degenerate predictions at low label rates and in imbalanced class regimes, particularly near class boundaries. We propose CutSSL: a framework for graph-based semi-supervised learning based on continuous nonconvex quadratic programming, which provably obtains \emph{integer} solutions. Our framework is naturally motivated by an \emph{exact} quadratic relaxation of a cardinality-constrained minimum-cut graph partitioning problem. Furthermore, we show our formulation is related to an optimization problem whose approximate solution is the mean-shifted Laplace learning heuristic, thus providing new insight into the performance of this heuristic. We demonstrate that CutSSL significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art on k-nearest neighbor graphs and large real-world graph benchmarks across a variety of label rates, class imbalance, and label imbalance regimes. Our implementation is available on Colab\footnote{\url{https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tGU5rxE1N5d0KGcNzlvZ0BgRc7_vob7b?usp=sharing}}.

Contracting with a Learning Agent
Real-life contractual relations typically involve repeated interactions between the principal and agent, where, despite theoretical appeal, players rarely use complex dynamic strategies and instead manage uncertainty through learning algorithms.In this paper, we initiate the study of repeated contracts with learning agents, focusing on those achieving no-regret outcomes. For the canonical setting where the agent’s actions result in success or failure, we present a simple, optimal solution for the principal: Initially provide a linear contract with scalar $\alpha > 0$, then switch to a zero-scalar contract. This shift causes the agent to “free-fall” through their action space, yielding non-zero rewards for the principal at zero cost. Interestingly, despite the apparent exploitation, there are instances where our dynamic contract can make \emph{both} players better off compared to the best static contract. We then broaden the scope of our results to general linearly-scaled contracts, and, finally, to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first analysis of optimization against learning agents with uncertainty about the time horizon.

CONTRAST: Continual Multi-source Adaptation to Dynamic Distributions
Adapting to dynamic data distributions is a practical yet challenging task. One effective strategy is to use a model ensemble, which leverages the diverse expertise of different models to transfer knowledge to evolving data distributions. However, this approach faces difficulties when the dynamic test distribution is available only in small batches and without access to the original source data. To address the challenge of adapting to dynamic distributions in such practical settings, we propose Continual Multi-source Adaptation to Dynamic Distributions (CONTRAST) that handles multiple source models and optimally combines them to adapt to the dynamic test data. CONTRAST has two distinguishing features. First, it efficiently computes the optimal combination weights to combine the source models to adapt to the test data distribution continuously as a function of time. Second, it identifies which of the source model parameters to update so that only the model which is most correlated to the target data is adapted, leaving the less correlated ones untouched; this mitigates the issue of ``forgetting" the source model parameters by focusing only on the source model that exhibits the strongest correlation with the test batch distribution. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that the combination of multiple source models does at least as well as the best source (with hindsight knowledge), and performance does not degrade as the test data distribution changes over time (robust to forgetting).

Contrastive dimension reduction: when and how?
Dimension reduction (DR) is an important and widely studied technique in exploratory data analysis. However, traditional DR methods are not applicable to datasets with with a contrastive structure, where data are split into a foreground group of interest (case or treatment group), and a background group (control group). This type of data, common in biomedical studies, necessitates contrastive dimension reduction (CDR) methods to effectively capture information unique to or enriched in the foreground group relative to the background group. Despite the development of various CDR methods, two critical questions remain underexplored: when should these methods be applied, and how can the information unique to the foreground group be quantified? In this work, we address these gaps by proposing a hypothesis test to determine the existence of contrastive information, and introducing a contrastive dimension estimator (CDE) to quantify the unique components in the foreground group. We provide theoretical support for our methods and validate their effectiveness through extensive simulated, semi-simulated, and real experiments involving images, gene expressions, protein expressions, and medical sensors, demonstrating their ability to identify the unique information in the foreground group.

Controlled maximal variability along with reliable performance in recurrent neural networks
Natural behaviors, even stereotyped ones, exhibit variability. Despite its role in exploring and learning, the neural basis of this variability is still not well understood. Given the coupling between neural activity and behavior, we ask what type of neural variability does not compromise behavioral performance. While previous studies typically curtail variability to enhance task performance in neural networks, our approach takes the reversed perspective. We investigate the possibility of generating maximal neural variability while at the same time permitting high network's functionality. To do so, we extend to neural activity the maximum occupancy principle (MOP) developed for behavior. We assume that the goal of the neural network is not driven by extrinsic task-related rewards but it is to maximize future action-state entropy, which entails creating all possible activity patterns while avoiding terminal or dangerous states.We show that this goal can be achieved through a neural network controller that learns to inject currents (actions) into a recurrent neural network of fixed random weights while maximizing the future cumulative action-state entropy. We demonstrate that large variability can be induced in the network while adhering to a maximum energy constraint or while avoiding terminal states on specific neurons' activities. Further, the network solves a context-dependent drawing task by flexibly switching between stochastic and deterministic modes as needed and projecting noise onto a null space. Based on future entropy production, these results contribute to a novel theory of neural variability that reconciles stochastic and deterministic behaviors within a single framework.

Controlling Continuous Relaxation for Combinatorial Optimization
Unsupervised learning (UL)-based solvers for combinatorial optimization (CO) train a neural network whose output provides a soft solution by directly optimizing the CO objective using a continuous relaxation strategy. These solvers offer several advantages over traditional methods and other learning-based methods, particularly for large-scale CO problems. However, UL-based solvers face two practical issues: (I) an optimization issue where UL-based solvers are easily trapped at local optima, and (II) a rounding issue where UL-based solvers require artificial post-learning rounding from the continuous space back to the original discrete space, undermining the robustness of the results. This study proposes a Continuous Relaxation Annealing (CRA) strategy, an effective rounding-free learning method for UL-based solvers. CRA introduces a penalty term that dynamically shifts from prioritizing continuous solutions, effectively smoothing the non-convexity of the objective function, to enforcing discreteness, eliminating the artificial rounding. Experimental results demonstrate that CRA significantly enhances the performance of UL-based solvers, outperforming existing UL-based solvers and greedy algorithms in complex CO problems. It also effectively eliminates the artificial rounding and accelerates the learning.

Controlling Counterfactual Harm in Decision Support Systems Based on Prediction Sets
Decision support systems based on prediction sets help humans solve multiclass classification tasks by narrowing down the set of potential label values to a subset of them, namely a prediction set, and asking them to always predict label values from the prediction sets. While this type of systems have been proven to be effective at improving the average accuracy of the predictions made by humans, by restricting human agency, they may cause harm---a human who has succeeded at predicting the ground-truth label of an instance on their own may have failed had they used these systems. In this paper, our goal is to control how frequently a decision support system based on prediction sets may cause harm, by design. To this end, we start by characterizing the above notion of harm using the theoretical framework of structural causal models. Then, we show that, under a natural, albeit unverifiable, monotonicity assumption, we can estimate how frequently a system may cause harm using only predictions made by humans on their own. Further, we also show that, under a weaker monotonicity assumption, which can be verified experimentally, we can bound how frequently a system may cause harm again using only predictions made by humans on their own. Building upon these assumptions, we introduce a computational framework to design decision support systems based on prediction sets that are guaranteed to cause harm less frequently than a user-specified value using conformal risk control. We validate our framework using real human predictions from two different human subject studies and show that, in decision support systems based on prediction sets, there is a trade-off between accuracy and counterfactual harm.

Controlling Multiple Errors Simultaneously with a PAC-Bayes Bound
Current PAC-Bayes generalisation bounds are restricted to scalar metrics of performance, such as the loss or error rate. However, one ideally wants more information-rich certificates that control the entire distribution of possible outcomes, such as the distribution of the test loss in regression, or the probabilities of different mis-classifications. We provide the first PAC-Bayes bound capable of providing such rich information by bounding the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the empirical and true probabilities of a set of M error types, which can either be discretized loss values for regression, or the elements of the confusion matrix (or a partition thereof) for classification. We transform our bound into a differentiable training objective. Our bound is especially useful in cases where the severity of different mis-classifications may change over time; existing PAC-Bayes bounds can only bound a particular pre-decided weighting of the error types. In contrast our bound implicitly controls all uncountably many weightings simultaneously.

Convergence of $\log(1/\epsilon)$ for Gradient-Based Algorithms in Zero-Sum Games without the Condition Number: A Smoothed Analysis
Gradient-based algorithms have shown great promise in solving large (two-player) zero-sum games. However, their success has been mostly confined to the low-precision regime because the number of iterations grows polynomially in $1/\epsilon$, where $\epsilon > 0$ is the duality gap. While it has been well-documented that linear convergence---an iteration complexity scaling as $\log(1/\epsilon)$---can be attained even with gradient-based algorithms, that comes at the cost of introducing a dependency on certain condition number-like quantities which can be exponentially large in the description of the game. To address this shortcoming, we analyze the iteration complexity of certain gradient-based algorithms in the celebrated model of smoothed complexity, and we show that they have polynomial smoothed complexity, in that their number of iterations grows as a polynomial in the dimensions of the game, $\log(1/\epsilon)$, and $1/\sigma$, where $\sigma$ measures the magnitude of the smoothing perturbation. Our result applies to optimistic gradient and extra-gradient descent/ascent as well as a certain iterative variant of Nesterov's smoothing technique by Gilpin et al. [2012]. En route, our characterization also makes a natural connection between the convergence rate of such algorithms and perturbation-stability properties of the equilibrium, which is of interest beyond the model of smoothed complexity.

Convolutional Differentiable Logic Gate Networks
With the increasing inference cost of machine learning models, there is a growing interest in models with fast and efficient inference. Recently, an approach for learning logic gate networks directly via a differentiable relaxation was proposed.Logic gate networks are faster than conventional neural network approaches because their inference only requires logic gate operators such as NAND, OR, and XOR, which are the underlying building blocks of current hardware and can be efficiently executed.We build on this idea, extending it by deep logic gate tree convolutions, logical OR pooling, and residual initializations. This allows scaling logic gate networks up by over one order of magnitude and utilizing the paradigm of convolution.On CIFAR-10, we achieve an accuracy of 86.38% using only 111 million logic gates, which improves over the SOTA while being 16x smaller.

Convolutions and More as Einsum: A Tensor Network Perspective with Advances for Second-Order Methods
Despite their simple intuition, convolutions are more tedious to analyze than dense layers, which complicates the transfer of theoretical and algorithmic ideas to convolutions. We simplify convolutions by viewing them as tensor networks (TNs) that allow reasoning about the underlying tensor multiplications by drawing diagrams, manipulating them to perform function transformations like differentiation, and efficiently evaluating them with `einsum`. To demonstrate their simplicity and expressiveness, we derive diagrams of various autodiff operations and popular curvature approximations with full hyper-parameter support, batching, channel groups, and generalization to any convolution dimension. Further, we provide convolution-specific transformations based on the connectivity pattern which allow to simplify diagrams before evaluation. Finally, we probe performance. Our TN implementation accelerates a recently-proposed KFAC variant up to 4.5 x while removing the standard implementation's memory overhead, and enables new hardware-efficient tensor dropout for approximate backpropagation.

Co-occurrence is not Factual Association in Language Models
Pretrained language models can encode a large amount of knowledge and utilize it for various reasoning tasks, yet they can still struggle to learn novel factual knowledge effectively from finetuning on limited textual demonstrations. In this work, we show that the reason for this deficiency is that language models are biased to learn word co-occurrence statistics instead of true factual associations. We identify the differences between two forms of knowledge representation in language models: knowledge in the form of co-occurrence statistics is encoded in the middle layers of the transformer model and does not generalize well to reasoning scenarios beyond simple question answering, while true factual associations are encoded in the lower layers and can be freely utilized in various reasoning tasks. Based on these observations, we propose two strategies to improve the learning of factual associations in language models. We show that training on text with implicit rather than explicit factual associations can force the model to learn factual associations instead of co-occurrence statistics, significantly improving the generalization of newly learned knowledge. We also propose a simple training method to actively forget the learned co-occurrence statistics, which unblocks and enhances the learning of factual associations when training on plain narrative text. On both synthetic and real-world corpora, the two proposed strategies improve the generalization of the knowledge learned during finetuning to reasoning scenarios such as indirect and multi-hop question answering.

Copycats: the many lives of a publicly available medical imaging dataset
Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting, and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates, and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for healthcare.

Corruption-Robust Linear Bandits: Minimax Optimality and Gap-Dependent Misspecification
How can we best learn in the presence of reward corruptions in interactive decision making? While a significant amount of work has been done to answer this question, we lack a holistic understanding for different types of adversary and measures of corruption, as well as a full characterization of the minimax regret bounds. In this work, we seek to develop a tight characterization of this problem in the linear bandit setting. We provide matching upper and lower bounds in the corrupted stochastic setting, and initiate the study on the corrupted adversarial setting, for which we obtain optimal scaling in the corruption level.We then argue that there is a deep connection between corruption-robust learning and learning with gap-dependent misspecification, a setting first studied by Liu et al. (2023) where it is assumed the misspecification level of an action or policy is proportional to its suboptimality. We show a general reduction that allows any corruption-robust algorithm to obtain regret bounds in settings with gap-dependent misspecification. This allows us to recover the results of Liu et al. (2023) in a black-box manner, and generalizes them significantly to settings such as linear MDPs, yielding the first results of their kind for gap-dependent misspecification in RL.Using our tight characterization of the corruption-robust setting, we show, however, that, despite the generality of this reduction, it is unable to obtain the optimal rate for gap-dependent misspecification. Motivated by this, we develop optimal bounds for gap-dependent misspecification in linear bandits, improving on the results of Liu et al. (2023).

CosAE: Learnable Fourier Series for Image Restoration
In this paper, we introduce Cosine Autoencoder (CosAE), a novel, generic Autoencoder that seamlessly leverages the classic Fourier series with a feed-forward neural network. CosAE represents an input image as a series of 2D Cosine time series, each defined by a tuple of learnable frequency and Fourier coefficients. This method stands in contrast to a conventional Autoencoder that often sacrifices detail in their reduced-resolution bottleneck latent spaces. CosAE, however, encodes frequency coefficients, i.e., the amplitudes and phases, in its bottleneck. This encoding enables extreme spatial compression, e.g., $64\times$ downsampled feature maps in the bottleneck, without losing detail upon decoding. We showcase the advantage of CosAE via extensive experiments on flexible-resolution super-resolution and blind image restoration, two highly challenging tasks that demand the restoration network to effectively generalize to complex and even unknown image degradations. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its capability to learn a generalizable representation for image restoration.

COSMIC: Compress Satellite Image Efficiently via Diffusion Compensation
With the rapidly increasing number of satellites in space and their enhanced capabilities, the amount of earth observation images collected by satellites is exceeding the transmission limits of satellite-to-ground links. Although existing learned image compression solutions achieve remarkable performance by using a sophisticated encoder to extract fruitful features as compression and using a decoder to reconstruct. It is still hard to directly deploy those complex encoders on current satellites' embedded GPUs with limited computing capability and power supply to compress images in orbit. In this paper, we propose COSMIC, a simple yet effective learned compression solution to transmit satellite images. We first design a lightweight encoder (i.e. reducing FLOPs by 2.5~5X) on satellite to achieve a high image compression ratio to save satellite-to-ground links. Then, for reconstructions on the ground, to deal with the feature extraction ability degradation due to simplifying encoders, we propose a diffusion-based model to compensate image details when decoding. Our insight is that satellite's earth observation photos are not just images but indeed multi-modal data with a nature of Text-to-Image pairing since they are collected with rich sensor data (e.g. coordinates, timestep, etc.) that can be used as the condition for diffusion generation.  Extensive experiments show that COSMIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both perceptual and distortion metrics.

Cost-aware Bayesian optimization via the Pandora's box Gittins index
Bayesian optimization is a technique for efficiently optimizing unknown functions in a black-box manner. To handle practical settings where gathering data requires use of finite resources, it is desirable to explicitly incorporate function evaluation costs into Bayesian optimization policies. To understand how to do so, we develop a previously-unexplored connection between cost-aware Bayesian optimization and the Pandora's box problem, a decision problem from economics. The Pandora's box problem admits a Bayesian-optimal solution based on an expression called the Gittins index, which can be reinterpreted as an acquisition function. We study the use of this acquisition function for cost-aware Bayesian optimization, and demonstrate empirically that it performs well, particularly in medium-high dimensions. We further show that this performance carries over to classical Bayesian optimization without explicit evaluation costs. Our work constitutes a first step towards integrating techniques from Gittins index theory into Bayesian optimization.

CoSW: Conditional Sample Weighting for Smoke Segmentation with Label Noise
Smoke segmentation is of great importance in precisely identifying the smoke location, enabling timely fire rescue and gas leak detection. However, due to the visual diversity and blurry edges of the non-grid smoke, noisy labels are almost inevitable in large-scale pixel-level smoke datasets. Noisy labels significantly impact the robustness of the model, and may lead to serious accidents. However, currently, there are no specific methods for addressing noisy labels in smoke segmentation. Smoke differs from regular objects as its transparency varies, causing inconsistent features in the noisy labels. In this paper, we propose a conditional sample weighting (CoSW). CoSW utilizes a multi-prototype framework, where prototypes serve as prior information to apply different weighting metrics to the different feature clusters. A novel regularized within-prototype entropy (RWE) is introduced to achieve CoSW and stable prototypes update. CoSW is concise and does not require data with clean labels during the training. The experiments show that our approach achieves SOTA performance on both real-world and synthetic noisy smoke segmentation datasets.

Counter-Current Learning: A Biologically Plausible Dual Network Approach for Deep Learning
Despite its widespread use in neural networks, error backpropagation has faced criticism for its lack of biological plausibility, suffering from issues such as the backward locking problem and the weight transport problem. These limitations have motivated researchers to explore more biologically plausible learning algorithms that could potentially shed light on how biological neural systems adapt and learn. Inspired by the counter-current exchange mechanisms observed in biological systems, we propose counter-current learning (CCL), a biologically plausible framework for credit assignment in deep learning. This framework employs a feedforward network to process input data and a feedback network to process targets, with each network enhancing the other through anti-parallel signal propagation. By leveraging the more informative signals from the bottom layer of the feedback network to guide the updates of the top layer of the feedforward network and vice versa, CCL enables the simultaneous transformation of source inputs to target outputs and the dynamic mutual influence of these transformations.Experimental results on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL-10 datasets using multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks demonstrate that CCL achieves comparable performance to other biological plausible algorithms while offering a more biologically realistic learning mechanism. Furthermore, we showcase the applicability of our approach to an autoencoder task, underscoring its potential for unsupervised representation learning.Our work presents a promising direction for biologically inspired and plausible learning algorithms, offering insights into the mechanisms of learning and adaptation in neural networks.

Counterfactual Fairness by Combining Factual and Counterfactual Predictions
In high-stakes domains such as healthcare and hiring, the role of machine learning (ML) in decision-making raises significant fairness concerns. This work focuses on Counterfactual Fairness (CF), which posits that an ML model's outcome on any individual should remain unchanged if they had belonged to a different demographic group.Previous works have proposed methods that guarantee CF. Notwithstanding, their effects on the model's predictive performance remain largely unclear.To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical study on the inherent trade-off between CF and predictive performance in a model-agnostic manner. We first propose a simple but effective method to cast an optimal but potentially unfair predictor into a fair one with a minimal loss of performance.By analyzing the excess risk incurred by perfect CF, we quantify this inherent trade-off. Further analysis on our method's performance with access to only incomplete causal knowledge is also conducted. Built upon this, we propose a practical algorithm that can be applied in such scenarios. Experiments on both synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the validity of our analysis and methods.

Coupled Mamba: Enhanced Multimodal Fusion with Coupled State Space Model
The essence of multi-modal fusion lies in exploiting the complementary information inherent in diverse modalities.However, most prevalent fusion methods rely on traditional neural architectures and are inadequately equipped to capture the dynamics of interactions across modalities, particularly in presence of complex intra- and inter-modality correlations.Recent advancements in State Space Models (SSMs), notably exemplified by the Mamba model, have emerged as promising contenders. Particularly, its state evolving process implies stronger modality fusion paradigm, making multi-modal fusion on SSMs an appealing direction. However, fusing multiple modalities is challenging for SSMs due to its hardware-aware parallelism designs. To this end, this paper proposes the Coupled SSM model, for coupling state chains of multiple modalities while maintaining independence of intra-modality state processes. Specifically, in our coupled scheme, we devise an inter-modal hidden states transition scheme, in which the current state is dependent on the states of its own chain and that of the neighbouring chains at the previous time-step. To fully comply with the hardware-aware parallelism, we obtain the global convolution kernel by deriving the state equation while introducing the historical state.Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSEI, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMSV2 through multi-domain input verify the effectiveness of our model compared to current state-of-the-art methods, improved F1-Score by 0.4%, 0.9%, and 2.3% on the three datasets respectively, 49% faster inference and 83.7% GPU memory save. The results demonstrate that Coupled Mamba model is capable of enhanced multi-modal fusion.

Crafting Hierarchical Strand-based Hair Geometry with Frequency-decomposed Representative Guide Curves
We introduce a hierarchical generative representation for strand hair geometry that progresses from coarse, low-pass filtered guide strands to densely populated hair strands rich in high-frequency details. Unlike traditional methods that sample guide strands from a regular 2D grid on a UV scalp map, our model utilizes $k$-medoids clustering centers from low-pass filtered dense strands as guide curves, which more accurately retain the hairstyle's inherent characteristics. We employ the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to separate low-frequency structural curves from high-frequency curliness and noise, avoiding the Gibbs' oscillation issues associated with the standard Fourier transform in open curves. Our variational autoencoder-based model, with its permutation-equivariant architecture, facilitates flexible, off-the-grid guide strand geometry modeling and enables the completion of dense strands in any quantity and density, drawing on principles from implicit neural representations. Empirical evaluations confirm the capacity of the model to generate convincing guide curves and dense strands, complete with nuanced high-frequency details.

CRAYM: Neural Field Optimization via Camera RAY Matching
We introduce camera ray matching (CRAYM) into the joint optimization of camera poses and neural fields from multi-view images. The optimized field, referred to as a feature volume, can be “probed” by the camera rays for novel view synthesis (NVS) and 3D geometry reconstruction. One key reason for matching camera rays, instead of pixels as in prior works, is that the camera rays can be parameterized by the feature volume to carry both geometric and photometric information. Multi-view consistencies involving the camera rays and scene rendering can be naturally integrated into the joint optimization and network training, to impose physically meaningful constraints to improve the final quality of both the geometric reconstruction and photorealistic rendering. We formulate our per-ray optimization and matched ray coherence by focusing on camera rays passing through keypoints in the input images to elevate both the efficiency and accuracy of scene correspondences. Accumulated ray features along the feature volume provide a means to discount the coherence constraint amid erroneous ray matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRAYM for both NVS and geometry reconstruction, over dense- or sparse-view settings, with qualitative and quantitative comparisons to state-of-the-art alternatives.

Credal Deep Ensembles for Uncertainty Quantification
This paper introduces an innovative approach to classification called Credal Deep Ensembles (CreDEs), namely, ensembles of novel Credal-Set Neural Networks (CreNets). CreNets are trained to predict a lower and an upper probability bound for each class, which, in turn, determine a convex set of probabilities (credal set) on the class set. The training employs a loss inspired by distributionally robust optimization which simulates the potential divergence of the test distribution from the training distribution, in such a way that the width of the predicted probability interval reflects the 'epistemic' uncertainty about the future data distribution. Ensembles can be constructed by training multiple CreNets, each associated with a different random seed, and averaging the outputted intervals.Extensive experiments are conducted on various out-of-distributions (OOD) detection benchmarks (CIFAR10/100 vs SVHN/Tiny-ImageNet, CIFAR10 vs CIFAR10-C, ImageNet vs ImageNet-O) and using different network architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, and ViT Base). Compared to Deep Ensembles baselines, CreDEs demonstrate higher test accuracy, lower expected calibration error, and significantly improved epistemic uncertainty estimation.

Credal Learning Theory
Statistical learning theory is the foundation of machine learning, providing theoretical bounds for the risk of models learned from a (single) training set, assumed to issue from an unknown probability distribution. In actual deployment, however, the data distribution may (and often does) vary, causing domain adaptation/generalization issues. In this paper we lay the foundations for a `credal' theory of learning, using convex sets of probabilities (credal sets) to model the variability in the data-generating distribution. Such credal sets, we argue, may be inferred from a finite sample of training sets. Bounds are derived for the case of finite hypotheses spaces (both assuming realizability or not), as well as infinite model spaces, which directly generalize classical results.

Cronos: Enhancing Deep Learning with Scalable GPU Accelerated Convex Neural Networks
We introduce the Cronos algorithm for convex optimization of two-layer neural networks. Cronos is the first algorithm capable of scaling to high-dimensional datasets such as ImageNet, which are ubiquitous in modern deep learning. This significantly improves upon prior work, which has been restricted to downsampled versions of MNIST and CIFAR-10.Taking Cronos as a primitive, we develop a new algorithm called CronosAM, which combines Cronos with alternating minimization, to obtain an algorithm capable of training multi-layer networks with arbitrary architectures.On the theoretical side, we show Cronos converges to the global minimum of the convex reformulation under mild assumptions.We validate the efficacy of Cronos and CronosAM through extensive numerical experiments.In particular, we show that CronosAM can obtain comparable or better validation accuracy than standard tuned deep learning optimizers on vision and language tasks with benchmark datasets such as ImageNet and IMDB.To the best of our knowledge, CronosAM is the first algorithm to utilize the convex reformulation to enhance performance on large-scale learning tasks.

Cross-Device Collaborative Test-Time Adaptation
Deep models often struggle to generalize when test data come from a novel domain different from the training data. Although numerous test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches have sought to enhance the model robustness against potential domain shifts, they primarily focus on single-device adaptation, where each device adapts independently from scratch. This method is inefficient for multi-device domain adaptation, as it neglects the valuable knowledge learned from diverse domains by other devices. In this paper, we propose test-time Collaborative Lifelong Adaptation (CoLA), which is a general paradigm that can be incorporated with existing advanced TTA methods to boost the adaptation performance and efficiency in a multi-device collaborative manner.  Specifically, we maintain and store a set of device-shared domain knowledge vectors, which accumulates the knowledge learned from all devices during their lifelong adaptation process. Based on this, CoLA conducts two collaboration strategies for devices with different computational resources and latency demands.  1) Knowledge reprogramming learning strategy jointly learns new domain-specific model parameters and a reweighting term to reprogram existing shared domain knowledge vectors, termed adaptation on principal agents.  2) Similarity-based knowledge aggregation strategy  solely aggregates the knowledge stored in shared domain vectors according to domain similarities in an optimization-free manner, termed adaptation on follower agents. Experiments verify that CoLA is plug-and-play, which boosts the efficiency of TTA and demonstrates remarkable superiority in collaborative, lifelong, and single-domain TTA scenarios, \eg, on follower agents, we enhance accuracy by over 30\% on ImageNet-C while maintaining nearly the same efficiency as standard inference.

Cross-Modality Perturbation Synergy Attack for Person Re-identification
In recent years, there has been significant research focusing on addressing security concerns in single-modal person re-identification (ReID) systems that are based on RGB images. However, the safety of cross-modality scenarios, which are more commonly encountered in practical applications involving images captured by infrared cameras, has not received adequate attention. The main challenge in cross-modality ReID lies in effectively dealing with visual differences between different modalities. For instance, infrared images are typically grayscale, unlike visible images that contain color information. Existing attack methods have primarily focused on the characteristics of the visible image modality, overlooking the features of other modalities and the variations in data distribution among different modalities. This oversight can potentially undermine the effectiveness of these methods in image retrieval across diverse modalities. This study represents the first exploration into the security of cross-modality ReID models and proposes a universal perturbation attack specifically designed for cross-modality ReID. This attack optimizes perturbations by leveraging gradients from diverse modality data, thereby disrupting the discriminator and reinforcing the differences between modalities. We conducted experiments on two widely used cross-modality datasets, namely RegDB and SYSU, which not only demonstrated the effectiveness of our method but also provided insights for future enhancements in the robustness of cross-modality ReID systems.

Cross-modal Representation Flattening for Multi-modal Domain Generalization
Multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) requires that models trained on multi-modal source domains can generalize to unseen target distributions with the same modality set. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) is an effective technique for traditional uni-modal domain generalization (DG), however, with limited improvement in MMDG. In this paper, we identify that modality competition and discrepant uni-modal flatness are two main factors that restrict multi-modal generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose to construct consistent flat loss regions and enhance knowledge exploitation for each modality via cross-modal knowledge transfer. Firstly, we turn to the optimization on representation-space loss landscapes instead of traditional parameter space, which allows us to build connections between modalities directly. Then, we introduce a novel method to flatten the high-loss region between minima from different modalities by interpolating mixed multi-modal representations. We implement this method by distilling and optimizing generalizable interpolated representations and assigning distinct weights for each modality considering their divergent generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments are performed on two benchmark datasets, EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon (HAC), with various modality combinations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method under multi-source and single-source settings.

Cross-video Identity Correlating for Person Re-identification Pre-training
Recent researches have proven that pre-training on large-scale person images extracted from internet videos is an effective way in learning better representations for person re-identification. However, these researches are mostly confined to pre-training at the instance-level or single-video tracklet-level. They ignore the identity-invariance in images of the same person across different videos, which is a key focus in person re-identification. To address this issue, we propose a Cross-video Identity-cOrrelating pre-traiNing (CION) framework. Defining a noise concept that comprehensively considers both intra-identity consistency and inter-identity discrimination, CION seeks the identity correlation from cross-video images by modeling it as a progressive multi-level denoising problem. Furthermore, an identity-guided self-distillation loss is proposed to implement better large-scale pre-training by mining the identity-invariance within person images. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the superiority of our CION in terms of efficiency and performance. CION achieves significantly leading performance with even fewer training samples. For example, compared with the previous state-of-the-art ISR, CION with the same ResNet50-IBN achieves higher mAP of 93.3% and 74.3% on Market1501 and MSMT17, while only utilizing 8% training samples. Finally, with CION demonstrating superior model-agnostic ability, we contribute a model zoo named ReIDZoo to meet diverse research and application needs in this field. It contains a series of CION pre-trained models with spanning structures and parameters, totaling 32 models with 10 different structures, including GhostNet, ConvNext, RepViT, FastViT and so on. The code and models will be open-sourced.

CryoGEM: Physics-Informed Generative Cryo-Electron Microscopy
In the past decade, deep conditional generative models have revolutionized the generation of realistic images, extending their application from entertainment to scientific domains. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is crucial in resolving near-atomic resolution 3D structures of proteins, such as the SARS-COV-2 spike protein. To achieve high-resolution reconstruction, neural methods for particle picking and pose estimation have been adopted. However, their performance is still limited as they lack high-quality annotated datasets. To address this, we introduce physics-informed generative cryo-electron microscopy (CryoGEM), which for the first time integrates physical-based cryo-EM simulation with a generative unpaired noise translation to generate physically correct synthetic cryo-EM datasets with realistic noises. Initially, CryoGEM simulates the cryo-EM imaging process based on a virtual specimen. To generate realistic noises, we leverage an unpaired noise translation via contrastive learning with a novel mask-guided sampling scheme. Extensive experiments show that CryoGEM is capable of generating realistic cryo-EM images. The generated dataset can further enhance particle picking and pose estimation models, eventually improving the reconstruction resolution. We will release our code and annotated synthetic datasets.

Cryptographic Hardness of Score Estimation
We show that L2-accurate score estimation, in the absence of strong assumptions on the data distribution, is computationally hard even when sample complexity is polynomial in the relevant problem parameters. Our reduction builds on the result of Chen et al. (ICLR 2023), who showed that the problem of generating samples from an unknown data distribution reduces to L2-accurate score estimation. Our hard-to-estimate distributions are the "Gaussian pancakes" distributions, originally due to Diakonikolas et al. (FOCS 2017), which have been shown to be computationally indistinguishable from the standard Gaussian under widely believed hardness assumptions from lattice-based cryptography (Bruna et al., STOC 2021; Gupte et al., FOCS 2022).

CSPG: Crossing Sparse Proximity Graphs for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search
The state-of-the-art approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithm builds a large proximity graph on the dataset and performs a greedy beam search, which may bring many unnecessary explorations. We develop a novel framework, namely *corssing sparse proximity graph (CSPG)*, based on random partitioning of the dataset. It produces a smaller sparse proximity graph for each partition and routing vectors that bind all the partitions. An efficient two-staged approach is designed for exploring *CSPG*, with fast approaching and cross-partition expansion. We theoretically prove that *CSPG* can accelerate the existing graph-based ANNS algorithms by reducing unnecessary explorations. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. The experimental results confirm that the existing graph-based methods can be significantly outperformed by incorporating *CSPG*, achieving 1.5x to 2x speedups of *QPS* in almost all recalls.

CURE4Rec: A Benchmark for Recommendation Unlearning with Deeper Influence
With increasing privacy concerns in artificial intelligence, regulations have mandated the right to be forgotten, granting individuals the right to withdraw their data from models. Machine unlearning has emerged as a potential solution to enable selective forgetting in models, particularly in recommender systems where historical data contains sensitive user information. Despite recent advances in recommendation unlearning, evaluating unlearning methods comprehensively remains challenging due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework and overlooked aspects of deeper influence, e.g., fairness. To address these gaps, we propose CURE4Rec, the first comprehensive benchmark for recommendation unlearning evaluation. CURE4Rec covers four aspects, i.e., unlearning Completeness, recommendation Utility, unleaRning efficiency, and recommendation fairnEss, under three data selection strategies, i.e., core data, edge data, and random data. Specifically, we consider the deeper influence of unlearning on recommendation fairness and robustness towards data with varying impact levels. We construct multiple datasets with CURE4Rec evaluation and conduct extensive experiments on existing recommendation unlearning methods. Our code is released at https://github.com/xiye7lai/CURE4Rec.

Curriculum Fine-tuning of Vision Foundation Model for Medical Image Classification Under Label Noise
Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in various vision tasks, yet their performance heavily rely on the quality of training data. Noisy label is a critical issue in medical dataset and can significantly degrade the model performance. Previous clean sample selection methods do not utilize the well pre-trained feature of vision foundation model (VFM) and assumed that training is start from scratch. In this paper, we propose Cufit, a curriculum fine-tuning paradigm of VFM for medical image classification under label noise. Our method is motivated by the fact that the linear probing of VFM relatively free from the noisy samples since it does not update feature extractor VFM, thus robustly classify the training samples. Subsequently, curriculum fine-tuning of two adapters is conducted by clean sample selection started from the linear probing. Our experimental results demonstrate that Cufit outperforms previous methods in various medical image benchmarks. Specifically, our method surpasses previous baselines 5.0\%, 2.1\%, 4.6\%, and 5.8\% on a 40\% noise rate of HAM10000, APTOS-2019, BloodMnist, and OrgancMnist, respectively. Furthermore, we provide extensive analyses to demonstrate impact of the our method on noisy label detection. For example, our method shows high label precision and label recall compared to the previous method. Our code will be available upon publication.

Customized Subgraph Selection and Encoding for Drug-drug Interaction Prediction
Subgraph-based methods have demonstrated strong and interpretable capabilities in predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs), which are crucial for both medical practice and drug development.Subgraph selection and encoding are critical stages in the framework of these methods. Customizing these components is promising but relatively unexplored due to the high cost of manual tweaking.In this work, inspired by the success of neural architecture search (NAS), we propose to search for data-specific components of the subgraph-based pipeline.In particular, we introduce comprehensive subgraph selection and encoding spaces to cover the diverse contexts of drug interactions for DDI prediction.Faced with vast spaces and overwhelming sampling overhead, we design an effective relaxation mechanism to efficiently explore optimal subgraph configurations using an approximation strategy, enabling a robust search algorithm to explore the search space efficiently.Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Additionally, the searched subgraphs and encoding functions clearly demonstrate the model's adaptivity.

CV-VAE: A Compatible Video VAE for Latent Generative Video Models
Spatio-temporal compression of videos, utilizing networks such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE), plays a crucial role in OpenAI's SORA and numerous other video generative models. For instance, many LLM-like video models learn the distribution of discrete tokens derived from 3D VAEs within the VQVAE framework, while most diffusion-based video models capture the distribution of continuous latent extracted by 2D VAEs without quantization. The temporal compression is simply realized by uniform frame sampling which results in unsmooth motion between consecutive frames. Currently, there lacks of a commonly used continuous video (3D) VAE for latent diffusion-based video models in the research community. Moreover, since current diffusion-based approaches are often implemented using pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, directly training a video VAE without considering the compatibility with existing T2I models will result in a latent space gap between them, which will take huge computational resources for training to bridge the gap even with the T2I models as initialization. To address this issue, we propose a method for training a video VAE of latent video models, namely CV-VAE, whose latent space is compatible with that of a given image VAE, e.g., image VAE of Stable Diffusion (SD). The compatibility is achieved by the proposed novel latent space regularization, which involves formulating a regularization loss using the image VAE. Benefiting from the latent space compatibility, video models can be trained seamlessly from pre-trained T2I or video models in a truly spatio-temporally compressed latent space, rather than simply sampling video frames at equal intervals. To improve the training efficiency, we also design a novel architecture for the video VAE. With our CV-VAE, existing video models can generate four times more frames with minimal finetuning. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed video VAE.

D2R2: Diffusion-based Representation with Random Distance Matching for Tabular Few-shot Learning
Tabular data is widely utilized in a wide range of real-world applications. The challenge of few-shot learning with tabular data stands as a crucial problem in both industry and academia, due to the high cost or even impossibility of annotating additional samples. However, the inherent heterogeneity of tabular features, combined with the scarcity of labeled data, presents a significant challenge in tabular few-shot classification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Diffusion-based Representation with Random Distance matching (D2R2) for tabular few-shot learning. D2R2 leverages the powerful expression ability of diffusion models to extract essential semantic knowledge crucial for denoising process. This semantic knowledge proves beneficial in few-shot downstream tasks. During the training process of our designed diffusion model, we introduce a random distance matching to preserve distance information in the embeddings, thereby improving effectiveness for classification. During the classification stage, we introduce an instance-wise iterative prototype scheme to improve performance by accommodating the multimodality of embeddings and increasing clustering robustness. Our experiments reveal the significant efficacy of D2R2 across various tabular few-shot learning benchmarks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in this field.

DapperFL: Domain Adaptive Federated Learning with Model Fusion Pruning for Edge Devices
Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent machine learning paradigm in edge computing environments, enabling edge devices to collaboratively optimize a global model without sharing their private data. However, existing FL frameworks suffer from efficacy deterioration due to the system heterogeneity inherent in edge computing, especially in the presence of domain shifts across local data. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous FL framework DapperFL, to enhance model performance across multiple domains. In DapperFL, we introduce a dedicated Model Fusion Pruning (MFP) module to produce personalized compact local models for clients to address the system heterogeneity challenges. The MFP module prunes local models with fused knowledge obtained from both local and remaining domains, ensuring robustness to domain shifts. Additionally, we design a Domain Adaptive Regularization (DAR) module to further improve the overall performance of DapperFL. The DAR module employs regularization generated by the pruned model, aiming to learn robust representations across domains. Furthermore, we introduce a specific aggregation algorithm for aggregating heterogeneous local models with tailored architectures and weights. We implement DapperFL on a real-world FL platform with heterogeneous clients. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with multiple domains demonstrate that DapperFL outperforms several state-of-the-art FL frameworks by up to 2.28\%, while significantly achieving model volume reductions ranging from 20\% to 80\%.

DarkSAM: Fooling Segment Anything Model to Segment Nothing
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has recently gained much attention for its outstanding generalization to unseen data and tasks. Despite its promising prospect, the vulnerabilities of SAM, especially to universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) have not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this paper, we propose DarkSAM, the first prompt-free universal attack framework against SAM, including a semantic decoupling-based spatial attack and a texture distortion-based frequency attack. We first divide the output of SAM into foreground and background. Then, we design a shadow target strategy to obtain the semantic blueprint of the image as the attack target. DarkSAM is dedicated to fooling SAM by extracting and destroying crucial object features from images in both spatial and frequency domains. In the spatial domain, we disrupt the semantics of both the foreground and background in the image to confuse SAM. In the frequency domain, we further enhance the attack effectiveness by distorting the high-frequency components (i.e., texture information) of the image. Consequently, with a single UAP, DarkSAM renders SAM incapable of segmenting objects across diverse images with varying prompts. Experimental results on four datasets for SAM and its two variant models demonstrate the powerful attack capability and transferability of DarkSAM.

Data Augmentation with Diffusion for Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) seeks to utilize unlabeled data to overcome the limited amount of labeled data and improve model performance. However, many SSL methods typically struggle in real-world scenarios, particularly when there is a large number of irrelevant instances in the unlabeled data that do not belong to any class in the labeled data. Previous approaches often downweight instances from irrelevant classes to mitigate the negative impact of class distribution mismatch on model training. However, by discarding irrelevant instances, they may result in the loss of valuable information such as invariance, regularity, and diversity within the data. In this paper, we propose a data-centric generative augmentation approach that leverages a diffusion model to enrich labeled data using both labeled and unlabeled samples. A key challenge is extracting the diversity inherent in the unlabeled data while mitigating the generation of samples irrelevant to the labeled data. To tackle this issue, we combine diffusion model training with a discriminator that identifies and reduces the impact of irrelevant instances. We also demonstrate that such a trained diffusion model can even convert an irrelevant instance into a relevant one, yielding highly effective synthetic data for training. Through a comprehensive suite of experiments, we show that our data augmentation approach significantly enhances the performance of SSL methods, especially in the presence of class distribution mismatch.

Data curation via joint example selection further accelerates multimodal learning
Data curation is an essential component of large-scale pretraining. In this work, we demonstrate that jointly prioritizing batches of data is more effective for learning than selecting examples independently. Multimodal contrastive objectives expose the dependencies between data and thus naturally yield criteria for measuring the joint learnability of a batch. We derive a simple and tractable algorithm for selecting such batches, which significantly accelerate training beyond individually-prioritized data points. As performance improves by selecting from large super-batches, we  also leverage recent advances in model approximation to reduce the computational overhead of scoring. As a result, our approach—multimodal contrastive learning with joint example selection (JEST)—surpasses state-of-the-art pretraining methods with up to 13$\times$ fewer iterations and 10$\times$ less computation. Essential to the performance of JEST is the ability to steer the data selection process towards the distribution of smaller, well-curated datasets via pretrained reference models, exposing data curation as a new dimension for neural scaling laws.

Data-faithful Feature Attribution: Mitigating Unobservable Confounders via Instrumental Variables
The state-of-the-art feature attribution methods often neglect the influence of unobservable confounders, posing a risk of misinterpretation, especially when it is crucial for the interpretation to remain faithful to the data. To counteract this, we propose a new approach, data-faithful feature attribution, which trains a confounder-free model using instrumental variables. The cluttered effects of unobservable confounders in a model trained as such are decoupled from input features, thereby aligning the output of the model with the contribution of input features to the target feature in the data generation. Furthermore, feature attribution results produced by our method are more robust when focusing on attributions from the perspective of data generation. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.

Data subsampling for Poisson regression
We develop and analyze data subsampling techniques for Poisson regression, the standard model for count data $y\in\mathbb{N}$. In particular, we consider the Poisson generalized linear model with ID- and square root-link functions. We consider the method of coresets, which are small weighted subsets that approximate the loss function of Poisson regression up to a factor of $1\pm\varepsilon$. We show $\Omega(n)$ lower bounds against coresets for Poisson regression that continue to hold against arbitrary data reduction techniques up to logarithmic factors. Introducing a novel complexity parameter and a domain shifting approach, we show that sublinear coresets with $1\pm\varepsilon$ approximation guarantee exist when the complexity parameter is small. In particular the dependence on the number of input points can be reduced to polylogarithmic. We show that the dependence on other input parameters can also be bounded sublinearly, though not always logarithmically. In particular, we show that the square root-link admits an $O(\log(y_{\max}))$ dependence, where $y_{\max}$ denotes the largest count presented in the data, while the ID-link requires a $\Theta(\sqrt{y_{\max}/\log(y_{\max})})$ dependence. As a side result for proving the tightness with respect to $y_{\max}$ in the case of the ID-link, we show an improved bound on the principal branch of the Lambert $W_0$ function, which may be of independent interest. We further show the limitations of our analysis when $p$th degree root-link functions for $p\geq 3$ are considered, which indicate that other analytical or computational methods would be required if such a generalization is even possible.

DAT: Improving Adversarial Robustness via Generative Amplitude Mix-up in Frequency Domain
To protect deep neural networks (DNNs) from adversarial attacks, adversarial training (AT) is developed by incorporating adversarial examples (AEs) into model training. Recent studies show that adversarial attacks disproportionately impact the patterns within the phase of the sample's frequency spectrum---typically containing crucial semantic information---more than those in the amplitude, resulting in the model's erroneous categorization of AEs. We find that, by mixing the amplitude of training samples' frequency spectrum with those of distractor images for AT, the model can be guided to focus on phase patterns unaffected by adversarial perturbations. As a result, the model's robustness can be improved. Unfortunately, it is still challenging to select appropriate distractor images, which should mix the amplitude without affecting the phase patterns. To this end, in this paper, we propose an optimized \emph{Adversarial Amplitude Generator (AAG)} to achieve a better tradeoff between improving the model's robustness and retaining phase patterns. Based on this generator, together with an efficient AE production procedure, we design a new \emph{Dual Adversarial Training (DAT)} strategy. Experiments on various datasets show that our proposed DAT leads to significantly improved robustness against diverse adversarial attacks. The source code is in supplementary materials.

DCDepth: Progressive Monocular Depth Estimation in Discrete Cosine Domain
In this paper, we introduce DCDepth, a novel framework for the long-standing monocular depth estimation task. Moving beyond conventional pixel-wise depth estimation in the spatial domain, our approach estimates the frequency coefficients of depth patches after transforming them into the discrete cosine domain. This unique formulation allows for the modeling of local depth correlations within each patch. Crucially, the frequency transformation segregates the depth information into various frequency components, with low-frequency components encapsulating the core scene structure and high-frequency components detailing the finer aspects. This decomposition forms the basis of our progressive strategy, which begins with the prediction of low-frequency components to establish a global scene context, followed by successive refinement of local details through the prediction of higher-frequency components. We conduct comprehensive experiments on NYU-Depth-V2, TOFDC, and KITTI datasets, and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DCDepth. The code will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.

DDR: Exploiting Deep Degradation Response as Flexible Image Descriptor
Image deep features extracted by pre-trained networks are known to contain rich and informative representations. In this paper, we present Deep Degradation Response (DDR), a method to quantify changes in image deep features under varying degradation conditions. Specifically, our approach facilitates flexible and adaptive degradation, enabling the controlled synthesis of image degradation through text-driven prompts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the versatility of DDR as an image descriptor, with strong correlations observed with key image attributes such as complexity, colorfulness, sharpness, and overall quality. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of DDR across a spectrum of applications. It excels as a blind image quality assessment metric, outperforming existing methodologies across multiple datasets. Additionally, DDR serves as an effective unsupervised learning objective in image restoration tasks, yielding notable advancements in image deblurring and single-image super-resolution. Our code will be made available.

Dealing with Synthetic Data Contamination in Online Continual Learning
Image generation has shown remarkable results in generating high-fidelity realistic images, in particular with the advancement of diffusion-based models. However, the prevalence of AI-generated images may have side effects for the machine learning community that are not clearly identified. Meanwhile, the success of deep learning in computer vision is driven by the massive dataset collected on the Internet. The extensive quantity of synthetic data being added to the Internet would become an obstacle for future researchers to collect "clean" datasets without AI-generated content. Prior research has shown that using datasets contaminated by synthetic images may result in performance degradation when used for training. In this paper, we investigate the potential impact of contaminated datasets on Online Continual Learning (CL) research. We experimentally show that contaminated datasets might hinder the training of existing online CL methods. Also, we propose Entropy Selection with Real-synthetic similarity Maximization (ESRM), a method to alleviate the performance deterioration caused by synthetic images when training online CL models. Experiments show that our method can significantly alleviate performance deterioration, especially when the contamination is severe. For reproducibility, the code is included in the supplementary material and will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Decentralized Noncooperative Games with Coupled Decision-Dependent Distributions
Distribution variations in machine learning, driven by the dynamic nature of deployment environments, significantly impact the performance of learning models. This paper explores endogenous distribution shifts in learning systems, where deployed models influence environments and subsequently alter data distributions. This phenomenon is formulated by a decision-dependent distribution mapping within the recently proposed framework of performative prediction (PP) Perdomo et al. (2020). We investigate the performative effect in a decentralized noncooperative game, where players aim to minimize private cost functions while simultaneously managing coupled inequality constraints. Under performativity, we examine two equilibrium concepts for the studied game: performative stable equilibrium (PSE) and Nash equilibrium (NE), and establish sufficient conditions for their existence and uniqueness. Notably, we provide the first upper bound on the distance between the PSE and NE in the literature, which is challenging to evaluate due to the absence of strong convexity on the joint cost function. Furthermore, we develop a decentralized stochastic primal-dual algorithm for efficiently computing the PSE point. By carefully bounding the performative effect in theoretical analysis, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sublinear convergence rates for both performative regrets and constraint violation and maintains the same order of convergence rate as the case without performativity. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm and theoretical results.

Decision-Focused Learning with Directional Gradients
We propose a novel family of decision-aware surrogate losses, called Perturbation Gradient (PG) losses, for the predict-then-optimize framework. These losses directly approximate the downstream decision loss and can be optimized using off-the-shelf gradient-based methods. Importantly, unlike existing surrogate losses, the approximation error of our PG losses vanishes as the number of samples grows. This implies that optimizing our surrogate loss yields a best-in-class policy asymptotically, even in misspecified settings.  This is the first such result in misspecified settings and we provide numerical evidence confirming our PG losses substantively outperform existing proposals when the underlying model is misspecified and the noise is not centrally symmetric.  Insofar as misspecification is commonplace in practice -- especially when we might prefer a simpler, more interpretable model -- PG losses offer a novel, theoretically justified, method for computationally tractable decision-aware learning.

Decision Mamba: A Multi-Grained State Space Model with Self-Evolution Regularization for Offline RL
While the conditional sequence modeling with the transformer architecture has demonstrated its effectiveness in dealing with offline reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, it is struggle to handle out-of-distribution states and actions.Existing work attempts to address this issue by data augmentation with the learned policy or adding extra constraints with the value-based RL algorithm. However, these studies still fail to overcome the following challenges: (1) insufficiently utilizing the historical temporal information among inter-steps, (2) overlooking the local intra-step relationships among states, actions and return-to-gos (RTGs), (3) overfitting suboptimal trajectories with noisy labels. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{D}$ecision $\textbf{M}$amba ($\textbf{DM}$), a novel multi-grained state space model (SSM) with a self-evolving policy learning strategy.DM explicitly models the historical hidden state to extract the temporal information by using the mamba architecture. To capture the relationship among state-action-RTG triplets, a fine-grained SSM module is designed and integrated into the original coarse-grained SSM in mamba, resulting in a novel mamba architecture tailored for offline RL. Finally, to mitigate the overfitting issue on noisy trajectories, a self-evolving policy is proposed by using progressive regularization. The policy evolves by using its own past knowledge to refine the suboptimal actions, thus enhancing its robustness on noisy demonstrations. Extensive experiments on various tasks show that DM outperforms other baselines substantially.

DECO-Bench: Unified Benchmark for Decoupled Task-Agnostic Synthetic Data Release
In this work, we tackle the question of how to systematically benchmark task-agnostic decoupling methods for privacy-preserving machine learning (ML). Sharing datasets that include sensitive information often triggers privacy concerns, necessitating robust decoupling methods to separate sensitive and non-sensitive attributes. Despite the development of numerous decoupling techniques, a standard benchmark for systematically comparing these methods remains absent. Our framework integrates various decoupling techniques along with synthetic data generation and evaluation protocols within a unified system. Using our framework, we benchmark various decoupling techniques and evaluating their privacy-utility trade-offs. Finally, we release our source code, pre-trained models, datasets of decoupled representations to foster research in this area.  The synthesized data and additional info can be found here http://tiny.cc/neurips24_decobench

Decomposable Transformer Point Processes
The standard paradigm of modeling marked point processes is by parameterizing the intensity function using an attention-based (Transformer-style) architecture. Despite the flexibility of these methods, their inference is based on the computationally intensive thinning algorithm. In this work, we propose a framework where the advantages of the attention-based architecture are maintained and the limitation of the thinning algorithm is circumvented. The framework depends on modeling the conditional distribution of inter-event times with a mixture of log-normals satisfying a Markov property and the conditional probability mass function for the marks with a Transformer-based architecture. The proposed method attains state-of-the-art performance in predicting the next event of a sequence given its history. The experiments also reveal the efficacy of the methods that do not rely on the thinning algorithm during inference over the ones they do. Finally, we test our method on the challenging long-horizon prediction task and find that it outperforms a baseline developed specifically for tackling this task; importantly, inference requires just a fraction of time compared to the thinning-based baseline.

Decoupled Kullback-Leibler Divergence Loss
In this paper, we delve deeper into the Kullback–Leibler (KL) Divergence loss and mathematically prove that it is equivalent to the Decoupled Kullback-Leibler (DKL) Divergence loss that consists of 1) a weighted Mean Square Error ($\mathbf{w}$MSE) loss and 2) a Cross-Entropy loss incorporating soft labels. Thanks to the decomposed formulation of DKL loss, we have identified two areas for improvement. Firstly, we address the limitation of KL/DKL in scenarios like knowledge distillation by breaking its asymmetric optimization property. This modification ensures that the $\mathbf{w}$MSE component is always effective during training, providing extra constructive cues. Secondly, we introduce class-wise global information into KL/DKL to mitigate bias from individual samples. With these two enhancements, we derive the Improved Kullback–Leibler (IKL) Divergence loss and evaluate its effectiveness by conducting experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets, focusing on adversarial training and knowledge distillation tasks. The proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art adversarial robustness on the public leaderboard --- {\textit RobustBench} and competitive performance on knowledge distillation, demonstrating the substantial practical merits.

Deep Correlated Prompting for Visual Recognition with Missing Modalities
Large-scale multimodal models have shown excellent performance over a series of tasks powered by the large corpus of paired multimodal training data. Generally, they are always assumed to receive modality-complete inputs. However, this simple assumption may not always hold in the real world due to privacy constraints or collection difficulty, where models pretrained on modality-complete data easily demonstrate degraded performance on missing-modality cases. To handle this issue, we refer to prompt learning to adapt large pretrained multimodal models to handle missing-modality scenarios by regarding different missing cases as different types of input. Instead of only prepending independent prompts to the intermediate layers, we present to leverage the correlations between prompts and input features and excavate the relationships between different layers of prompts to carefully design the instructions. We also incorporate the complementary semantics of different modalities to guide the prompting design for each modality. Extensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the previous approaches upon different missing scenarios. Plentiful ablations are further given to show the generalizability and reliability of our method upon different modality-missing ratios and types.

DeepDRK: Deep Dependency Regularized Knockoff for Feature Selection
Model-X knockoff, among various feature selection methods, received much attention recently due to its guarantee on false discovery rate (FDR) control. Subsequent to its introduction in parametric design, knockoff is advanced to handle arbitrary data distributions using deep learning-based generative modeling. However, we observed that current implementations of the deep Model-X knockoff framework exhibit limitations. Notably, the "swap property" that knockoffs necessitate frequently encounter challenges on sample level, leading to a diminished selection power. To overcome, we develop "Deep Dependency Regularized Knockoff (DeepDRK)", a distribution-free deep learning method that strikes a balance between FDR and power. In DeepDRK, we propose the novel formulation of the knockoff model as a learning problem under multi-source adversarial attacks. With a novel perturbation technique, we achieve lower FDR and higher power. Our model outperforms other benchmarks in synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data, especially when sample size is small and data distribution is complex.

Deep Equilibrium Algorithmic Reasoning
Neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR) research has demonstrated that graph neural networks (GNNs) could learn to execute classical algorithms. However, most previous approaches have always used a recurrent architecture, where each iteration of the GNN aligns with an iteration of the algorithm. In this paper we study neurally solving algorithms from a different perspective: since the algorithm’s solution is often an equilibrium, it is possible to find the solution directly by solving an equilibrium equation. This both improves the alignment of GNNs to algorithms and is also a step towards speeding up NAR models. Our empirical evidence, leveraging algorithms from the CLRS-30 benchmark validates that one can train a network to solve algorithmic problems by directly finding the equilibrium. We discuss the practical implementation of such models and propose regularisations to improve the performance of these equilibrium reasoners.

Deep Graph Neural Networks via Posteriori-Sampling-based Node-Adaptative Residual Module
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a type of neural network that can learn from graph-structured data through neighborhood information aggregation, have shown superior performance in various downstream tasks. However, as the number of layers increases, node representations becomes indistinguishable, which is known as over-smoothing. To address this issue, many residual methods have emerged. In this paper, we focus on the over-smoothing issue and related residual methods. Firstly, we revisit over-smoothing from the perspective of overlapping neighborhood subgraphs, and based on this, we explain how residual methods can alleviate over-smoothing by integrating multiple orders neighborhood subgraphs to avoid the indistinguishability of the single high-order neighborhood subgraphs. Additionally, we reveal the drawbacks of previous residual methods, such as the lack of node adaptability and severe loss of high-order neighborhood subgraph information, and propose a \textbf{Posterior-Sampling-based, Node-Adaptive Residual module (PSNR)}. We theoretically demonstrate that PSNR can alleviate the drawbacks of previous residual methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments verify the superiority of the PSNR module in fully observed node classification and missing feature scenarios. Our codeis available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PSNR-GNN-B60D}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PSNR-GNN-B60D}.

DeepITE: Designing Variational Graph Autoencoders for Intervention Target Estimation
Intervention Target Estimation (ITE) is vital for both understanding and decision-making in complex systems, yet it remains underexplored. Current ITE methods are hampered by their inability to learn from distinct intervention instances collaboratively and to incorporate rich insights from labeled data, which leads to inefficiencies such as the need for re-estimation of intervention targets with minor data changes or alterations in causal graphs. In this paper, we propose DeepITE, an innovative deep learning framework designed around a variational graph autoencoder. DeepITE can concurrently learn from both unlabeled and labeled data with different intervention targets and causal graphs, harnessing correlated information in a self or semi-supervised manner. The model's inference capabilities allow for the immediate identification of intervention targets on unseen samples and novel causal graphs, circumventing the need for retraining. Our extensive testing confirms that DeepITE not only surpasses 13 baseline methods in the Recall@k metric but also demonstrates expeditious inference times, particularly on large graphs. Moreover, incorporating a modest fraction of labeled data (5-10\%) substantially enhances DeepITE's performance, further solidifying its practical applicability. Code will be available upon publication.

DeepLag: Discovering Deep Lagrangian Dynamics for Intuitive Fluid Prediction
Accurately predicting the future fluid is important to extensive areas such as meteorology, oceanology, and aerodynamics. However, since the fluid is usually observed from an Eulerian perspective, its moving and intricate dynamics are seriously obscured and confounded in static grids, bringing thorny challenges to the prediction. This paper introduces a new Lagrangian-Eulerian combined paradigm to tackle the tanglesome fluid dynamics. Instead of solely predicting the future based on Eulerian observations, we propose DeepLag to discover hidden Lagrangian dynamics within the fluid, by tracking movements of adaptively sampled key particles. DeepLag utilizes the proposed multiscale Eulag Block to communicate the learned Eulerian and Lagrangian features by two transformer blocks, where the Lagrangian movement of the tracked particles is inferred from Eulerian observations, and their accumulated Lagrangian dynamics information is incorporated into global Eulerian evolving features to guide future prediction respectively. Tracking key particles not only provides a clear and interpretable clue for fluid dynamics but also makes our model free from modeling complex correlations among massive grids for better efficiency. Experimentally, DeepLag excels in three challenging fluid prediction tasks, covering both 2D and 3D, simulated and real-world fluids.

Deep Learning in Medical Image Registration: Magic or Mirage?
Classical optimization and learning-based methods are the two reigning paradigms in deformable image registration. While optimization-based methods boast generalizability across modalities and robust performance, learning-based methods promise peak performance, incorporating weak supervision and amortized optimization. However, the exact conditions for either paradigm to perform well over the other are shrouded and not explicitly outlined in the existing literature. In this paper, we make an explicit correspondence between the mutual information of the distribution of per-pixel intensity and labels, and the performance of classical registration methods. This strong correlation hints to the fact that architectural designs in learning-based methods is unlikely to affect this correlation, and therefore, the performance of learning-based methods. This hypothesis is thoroughly validated with state-of-the-art classical and learning-based methods. However, learning-based methods with weak supervision can perform high-fidelity intensity and label registration, which is not possible with classical methods. Next, we show that this high-fidelity feature learning does not translate to invariance to domain shift, and learning-based methods are sensitive to such changes in the data distribution. Finally, we propose a general recipe to choose the best paradigm for a given registration problem, based on these observations.

Deep linear networks for regression are implicitly regularized towards flat minima
The largest eigenvalue of the Hessian, or sharpness, of neural networks is a key quantity to understand their optimization dynamics. In this paper, we study the sharpness of deep linear networks for overdetermined univariate regression. Minimizers can have arbitrarily large sharpness, but not an arbitrarily small one. Indeed, we show a lower bound on the sharpness of minimizers, which grows linearly with depth. We then study the properties of the minimizer found by gradient flow, which is the limit of gradient descent with vanishing learning rate. We show an implicit regularization towards flat minima: the sharpness of the minimizer is no more than a constant times the lower bound. The constant depends on the condition number of the data covariance matrix, but not on width or depth. This result is proven both for a small-scale initialization and a residual initialization. Results of independent interest are shown in both cases. For small-scale initialization, we show that the learned weight matrices are approximately rank-one and that their singular vectors align. For residual initialization, convergence of the gradient flow for a Gaussian initialization of the residual network is proven. Numerical experiments illustrate our results and connect them to gradient descent with non-vanishing learning rate.

Deep Support Vectors
Deep learning has achieved tremendous success. However, unlike SVMs, which provide direct decision criteria and can be trained with a small dataset, it still has significant weaknesses due to its requirement for massive datasets during training and the black-box characteristics on decision criteria. This paper addresses these issues by identifying support vectors in deep learning models. To this end, we propose the DeepKKT condition, an adaptation of the traditional Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition for deep learning models, and confirm that generated Deep Support Vectors (DSVs) using this condition exhibit properties similar to traditional support vectors. This allows us to apply our method to few-shot dataset distillation problems and alleviate the black-box characteristics of deep learning models. Additionally, we demonstrate that the DeepKKT condition can transform conventional classification models into generative models with high fidelity, particularly as latent generation models using class labels as latent variables. We validate the effectiveness of DSVs using common datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) on the general architectures (ResNet and ConvNet), proving their practical applicability.

Defensive Unlearning with Adversarial Training for Robust Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models
Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, but they also pose safety risks, such as the potential generation of harmful content and copyright violations. The techniques of machine unlearning, also known as concept erasing, have been developed to address these risks. However, these techniques remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks, which can prompt DMs post-unlearning to regenerate undesired images containing concepts (such as nudity) meant to be erased. This work aims to enhance the robustness of concept erasing by integrating the principle of adversarial training (AT) into machine unlearning, resulting in the robust unlearning framework referred to as AdvUnlearn. However, achieving this effectively and efficiently is highly nontrivial. First, we find that a straightforward implementation of AT compromises DMs’ image generation quality post-unlearning. To address this, we develop a utility-retaining regularization on an additional retain set, optimizing the trade-off between concept erasure robustness and model utility in AdvUnlearn. Moreover, we identify the text encoder as a more suitable module for robustification compared to UNet, ensuring unlearning effectiveness. And the acquired text encoder can serve as a plug-and-play robust unlearner for various DM types. Empirically, we perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness advantage of AdvUnlearn across various DM unlearning scenarios, including the erasure of nudity, objects, and style concepts. In addition to robustness, AdvUnlearn also achieves a balanced tradeoff with model utility. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore robust DM unlearning through AT, setting it apart from existing methods that overlook robustness in concept erasing.Warning: This paper contains model outputs that may be offensive in nature.

DEFT: Efficient Finetuning of Conditional Diffusion Models by Learning the Generalised $h$-transform
Generative modelling paradigms based on denoising diffusion processes have emerged as a leading candidate for \textit{conditional} sampling in inverse problems. In many real-world applications, we often have access to large, expensively trained unconditional diffusion models, which we aim to exploit for improving conditional sampling. Most recent approaches are motivated heuristically and lack a unifying framework, obscuring connections between them. Further, they often suffer from issues such as being very sensitive to hyperparameters, being expensive to train or needing access to weights hidden behind a closed API. Under this framework, we propose DEFT \textit{(Doob's h-transform Efficient FineTuning)}, a new approach for conditional generation that simply fine-tunes a very small network to quickly learn the conditional $h$-transform, while keeping the larger unconditional network unchanged. DEFT is much faster than existing baselines, while achieving state-of-the-art performance across a variety of linear and non-linear benchmarks. On \emph{image reconstruction} tasks, we achieve speedups of up to 1.6$\times$, while having the best perceptual quality on natural images and reconstruction performance on medical images.

DEL: Discrete Element Learner for Learning 3D Dynamics from 2D Observations
Learning-based simulators show great potential for simulating particle dynamics when 3D groundtruth is available, but per-particle correspondences are not always accessible. The development of neural rendering presents a new solution to this field to learn 3D dynamics from 2D images by inverse rendering. However, existing approaches still suffer from ill-posed natures resulting from the 2D to 3D uncertainty, for example, specific 2D images can correspond with various 3D particle distributions. To mitigate such uncertainty, we consider a conventional, mechanically interpretable framework as the physical priors and extend it to a learning-based version. In brief, we incorporate the learnable graph kernels into the classic Discrete Element Analysis (DEA) framework to implement a novel mechanics-informed network architecture. In this case, the graph networks are only used for approximating some specific mechanical operators in the DEA framework rather than the whole dynamics mapping. By integrating the strong physics priors, our methods can effectively learn the dynamics of various materials from the partial 2D observations in a unified manner. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other learned simulators by a large margin in this context and is robust to different renderers, fewer training samples, and fewer camera views.

DeltaDEQ: Exploiting Heterogeneous Convergence for Accelerating Deep Equilibrium Iterations
Implicit neural networks including deep equilibrium models have achieved superior task performance with better parameter efficiency in various applications. However, it is often at the expense of higher computation costs during inference. In this work, we identify a phenomenon named $\textbf{heterogeneous convergence}$ that exists in deep equilibrium models and other iterative methods. We observe much faster convergence of state activations in certain dimensions therefore indicating the dimensionality of the underlying dynamics of the forward pass is much lower than the defined dimension of the states. We thereby propose to exploit heterogeneous convergence by storing past linear operation results (e.g., fully connected and convolutional layers) and only propagating the state activation when its change exceeds a threshold. Thus, for the already converged dimensions, the computations can be skipped. We verified our findings and reached 84\% FLOPs reduction on the implicit neural representation task, 73\% on the Sintel and 76\% on the KITTI datasets for the optical flow estimation task while keeping comparable task accuracy with the models that perform the full update.

Demographic parity fair regression in unaware setting
We consider the problem of regression under the demographic parity constraint without access to the sensitive attribute at the inference time. We build a general-purpose post-processing algorithm that, given an accurate estimates of the regression function and sensitive attribute predictor, outputs a prediction function satisfying the demographic parity constraint. The algorithm relies on discretization and on a stochastic minimization of a convex smooth function. It can be used for online post-processing and for addressing multi-class classification setup. Unlike previous algorithms, we provide a fully theory-driven approach. We require a tight control of the norm of the gradient of the aforementioned convex function and thus rely on more sophisticated methods than the vanilla stochastic gradient descent. Our algorithm is supported by a finite-sample analysis and post-processing type bounds. Experimental validation confirms the developed theory.

Demystify Mamba in Vision: A Linear Attention Perspective
Mamba, an effective state space model with linear computation complexity, is seen as a promising method to deal with high-resolution images in various vision tasks. Nevertheless, the powerful Mamba model shares surprising similarities with linear attention Transformer, which typically delivers poor performance and is suboptimal for application. In this paper, we explore the similarities and disparities between Mamba and linear attention Transformer, providing comprehensive analyses to demystify the key factors behind Mamba's success. Specifically, we begin with the formulas and rephrase Mamba as a variant of linear attention Transformer with six distinctions: input gate, forget gate, shortcut, no attention normalization, single-head and modified block design. For each design, we meticulously analyze its pros and cons and evaluate its suitability for vision tasks. Moreover, empirical studies are conducted to assess the impact of each design, highlighting the forget gate, and block design as the core contributors to Mamba's success. Based on our findings, we propose our \textit{Mamba-Like Linear Attention (MLLA)} model by incorporating the merits of these two key designs into linear attention. We empirically observe that MLLA outperforms various vision Mamba models on both image classification and high-resolution dense prediction tasks, while preserving parallelizable computation and fast inference speed. Code will be released.

DeNetDM: Debiasing by Network Depth Modulation
Neural networks trained on biased datasets tend to inadvertently learn spurious correlations, hindering generalization. We formally prove that (1) samples that exhibit spurious correlations lie on a lower rank manifold relative to the ones that do not; and (2) the depth of a network acts as an implicit regularizer on the rank of the attribute subspace that is encoded in its representations.Leveraging these insights, we present DeNetDM, a novel debiasing method that uses network depth modulation as a way of developing robustness to spurious correlations. Using a training paradigm derived from Product of Experts, we create both biased and debiased branches with deep and shallow architectures and then distill knowledge to produce the target debiased model. Our method requires no bias annotations or explicit data augmentation while performing on par with approaches that require either or both. We demonstrate that DeNetDM outperforms existing debiasing techniques on both synthetic and real-world datasets by 5\%. Source code will be available upon acceptance.

DenoiseReID: Denoising Model for Representation Learning of Person Re-Identification
The denoising model has been proven a powerful generative model but has little exploration of discriminative tasks. Representation learning is important in discriminative tasks, which is defined as "learning representations (or features) of the data that make it easier to extract useful information when building classifiers or other predictors" in "Representation learning: A review and new perspectives". In this paper, we propose a novel Denoising Model for Representation Learning and take Person Re-Identification (ReID) as a benchmark task, named  DenoiseReID, to improve feature discriminative with joint feature extraction and denoising. In the deep learning epoch, backbones which consists of cascaded embedding layers (e.g. convolutions or transformers) to progressively extract useful features, becomes popular. We first view each embedding layer in a backbone as a denoising layer, processing the cascaded embedding layers as if we are recursively denoise features step-by-step. This unifies the frameworks of feature extraction and feature denoising, where the former progressively embeds features from low-level to high-level, and the latter recursively denoises features step-by-step. Then we design a novel Feature Extraction and Feature Denoising Fusion Algorithm (FEFDFA) and \textit{theoretically demonstrate} its equivalence before and after fusion. FEFDFA merges parameters of the denoising layers into existing embedding layers, thus making feature denoising computation-free. This is a label-free algorithm to incrementally improve feature also complementary to the label if available. Besides, it enjoys two advantages: 1) it's a computation-free and label-free plugin for incrementally improving ReID features. 2) it is complementary to the label if the label is available. Experimental results on various tasks (large-scale image classification, fine-grained image classification, image retrieval) and backbones (transformers and convolutions) show the scalability and stability of our method. Experimental results on 4 ReID datasets and various of backbones show the stability and impressive improvements. We also extend the proposed method to large-scale (ImageNet) and fine-grained (e.g. CUB200) classification tasks, similar improvements are proven. We will open source the code to the GitHub.

Denoising Diffusion Path: Attribution Noise Reduction with An Auxiliary Diffusion Model
The explainability of deep neural networks (DNNs) is critical for trust and reliability in AI systems. Path-based attribution methods, such as Integrated Gradients (IG), aim to explain predictions by accumulating gradients along a path from a baseline to the target image.  However, noise accumulated during this process can significantly distort the explanation. Existing methods primarily focus on finding alternative paths to bypass noise while overlooking a crucial factor that intermediate steps often deviate from the training data distribution, further amplifying noise. This work presents a novel Denoising Diffusion Path (DDPath) to tackle this challenge by harnessing the power of diffusion models for denoising.  By leveraging the inherent ability of diffusion models to progressively remove noise from an image, DDPath constructs a piece-wise linear path where each segment guarantees samples drawn from a Gaussian distribution centered at the target image; this also ensures the gradual disappearance of noise along the path towards cleaner and more interpretable attributions.  We further demonstrate that DDPath adheres to essential axiomatic properties for attribution methods and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods like IG. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DDPath significantly reduces noise in the attributions---resulting in clearer explanations---and achieves better quantitative results compared to traditional path-based methods.

DenseFormer: Enhancing Information Flow in Transformers via Depth Weighted Averaging
The transformer architecture by Vaswani et al. (2017) is now ubiquitous across application domains, from natural language processing to speech processing and image understanding. We propose DenseFormer, a simple modification to the standard architecture that improves the perplexity of the model without increasing its size---adding a few thousand parameters for large-scale models in the 100B parameters range. Our approach relies on an additional averaging step after each transformer block, which computes a weighted average of current and past representations---we refer to this operation as Depth-Weighted-Average (DWA). The learned DWA weights exhibit coherent patterns of information flow, revealing the strong and structured reuse of activations from distant layers. Experiments demonstrate that DenseFormer is more data efficient, reaching the same perplexity of much deeper transformer models, and that for the same perplexity, these new models outperform transformer baselines in terms of memory efficiency and inference time.

Density-based User Representation using Gaussian Process Regression for Multi-interest Personalized Retrieval
Accurate modeling of the diverse and dynamic interests of users remains a significant challenge in the design of personalized recommender systems. Existing user modeling methods, like single-point and multi-point representations, have limitations w.r.t.\ accuracy, diversity, and adaptability. To overcome these deficiencies, we introduce density-based user representations (DURs), a novel method that leverages Gaussian process regression (GPR) for effective multi-interest recommendation and retrieval. Our approach, GPR4DUR, exploits DURs to capture user interest variability without manual tuning, incorporates uncertainty-awareness, and scales well to large numbers of users. Experiments using real-world offline datasets confirm the adaptability and efficiency of GPR4DUR, while online experiments with simulated users demonstrate its ability to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off by effectively utilizing model uncertainty. The source code is available at the anonymous link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GPR4DUR-0D8B/README.md.

DePLM: Denoising Protein Language Models for Property Optimization
Protein optimization is a fundamental biological task aimed at enhancing the performance of proteins by modifying their sequences. Computational methods primarily rely on evolutionary information (EI) encoded by protein language models (PLMs) to carry out this optimization. However, these methods suffer from a few limitations. (1) Evolutionary processes involve the simultaneous consideration of multiple functional properties, often overshadowing the specific property of interest. (2) Measurements of these properties tend to be tailored to experimental conditions, leading to reduced generalizability of trained models to novel proteins. To address these limitations, we introduce Denoising Protein Language Models (DePLM), a novel approach that refines the evolutionary information embodied in PLMs for improved protein optimization. Specifically, we conceptualize EI as comprising both property-relevant and irrelevant information, with the latter acting as “noise” for the optimization task at hand. Our approach involves denoising this EI in PLMs through a diffusion process conducted in the rank space of property values, thereby enhancing model generalization and ensuring dataset-agnostic learning. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that DePLM not only surpasses the state-of-the-art in mutation effect prediction but also exhibits strong generalization capabilities for novel proteins.

DEPrune: Depth-wise Separable Convolution Pruning for Maximizing GPU Parallelism
Depth-wise Separable Convolution (DSConv) has a powerful representation even with fewer parameters and computation, leading to its adoption by almost all of the state-of-the-art CNN models. DSConv models are already compact making it hard to apply pruning, and there are no previous pruning techniques that even target depth-wise convolution (DW-conv).In this paper, we present the novel Depth-wise Separable Convolution Pruning (DEPrune), the first pruning implementation on not only point-wise convolution but also DW-Conv, which is optimized by considering and analyzing the computation of DSConv on GPU, which is the most widely used AI accelerator.DEPrune employs a fine-grained pruning approach, yet it achieves the structured sparsity typically absent in fine-grained pruning, enabling practical hardware acceleration. Moreover, this method maintains a high pruning ratio without causing any accuracy drop.We additionally represent techniques that further enhance DEPrune performance: 1) balanced workload tuning (BWT), and 2) hardware-aware sparsity recalibration (HSR).Experiment results show that DSPrune achieves up to $3.74\times$ practical speedup in DSConv inference on GPUs while maintaining the accuracy of EfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet.

Depth Anything V2
This work presents Depth Anything V2. Without pursuing fancy techniques, we aim to reveal crucial findings to pave the way towards building a powerful monocular depth estimation model. Notably, compared with V1, this version produces much finer and more robust depth predictions through three key practices: 1) replacing all labeled real images with synthetic images, 2) scaling up the capacity of our teacher model, and 3) teaching student models via the bridge of large-scale pseudo-labeled real images. Compared with the latest models built on Stable Diffusion, our models are significantly more efficient (more than 10x faster) and more accurate. We offer models of different scales (ranging from 25M to 1.3B params) to support extensive scenarios. Benefiting from their strong generalization capability, we fine-tune them with metric depth labels to obtain our metric depth models. In addition to our models, considering the limited diversity and frequent noise in current test sets, we construct a versatile evaluation benchmark with sparse depth annotations to facilitate future research.

Derandomizing Multi-Distribution Learning
Multi-distribution or collaborative learning involves learning a single predictor that works well across multiple data distributions, using samples from each during training. Recent research on multi-distribution learning, focusing on binary loss and finite VC dimension classes, has shown near-optimal sample complexity that is achieved with oracle efficient algorithms. That is, these algorithms are computationally efficient given an efficient ERM for the class. Unlike in classical PAC learning, where the optimal sample complexity is achieved with deterministic predictors, current multi-distribution learning algorithms output randomized predictors. This raises the question: can these algorithms be derandomized to produce a deterministic predictor for multiple distributions? Through a reduction to discrepancy minimization, we show that derandomizing multi-distribution learning is computationally hard, even when ERM is computationally efficient. On the positive side, we identify a structural condition enabling an efficient black-box reduction, converting existing randomized multi-distribution predictors into deterministic ones.

DETAIL: Task DEmonsTration Attribution for Interpretable In-context Learning
In-context learning (ICL) allows transformer-based language models that are pre-trained on general text to quickly learn a specific task with a few "task demonstrations"  without updating their parameters, significantly boosting their flexibility and generality. ICL possesses many distinct characteristics from conventional machine learning, thereby requiring new approaches to interpret this learning paradigm. Taking the viewpoint of recent works showing that transformers learn in context by formulating an internal optimizer, we propose an influence function-based attribution technique, DETAIL, that addresses the specific characteristics of ICL. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our approach for demonstration attribution while being computationally efficient. Leveraging the results, we then show how DETAIL can help improve model performance in real-world scenarios through demonstration reordering and curation. Finally, we experimentally prove the wide applicability of DETAIL by showing our attribution scores obtained on white-box models are transferable to black-box models in improving model performance.

Detecting and Measuring Confounding Using Causal Mechanism Shifts
Detecting and quantifying confounding effects from data is a key challenge in causal inference. Existing methods frequently assume causal sufficiency, disregarding the presence of unobserved confounding variables. Causal sufficiency is both unrealistic and empirically untestable. Additionally, existing methods make strong parametric assumptions about the underlying causal generative process to guarantee the identifiability of confounding variables. Relaxing the above assumptions and leveraging recent advancements in causal discovery and confounding analysis with non-i.i.d. data, we propose a comprehensive approach for detecting and measuring confounding effects. We consider various definitions of confounding and introduce tailored methodologies to achieve three objectives: (i) detecting and quantifying confounding between pairs and multiple variables, (ii) separating unobserved confounding effects from total confounding effects, and (iii) understanding the relative strengths of confounding between different sets of variables. We examine some useful properties of our measures and present algorithms for measuring confounding. Our study provides a unified approach to measuring confounding, and our empirical results support the theoretical analysis.

Detecting Brittle Decisions for Free: Leveraging Margin Consistency in Deep Robust Classifiers
Despite extensive research on adversarial training strategies to improve robustness, the decisions of even the most robust deep learning models can still be quite sensitive to imperceptible perturbations, creating serious risks when deploying them for high-stakes real-world applications. While detecting such cases may be critical, evaluating a model's vulnerability at a per-instance level using adversarial attacks is computationally too intensive and not suitable for real-time deployment scenarios. The input space margin is the exact score to detect non-robust samples, is intractable for deep neural networks. This paper introduces the concept of margin consistency -- a property that links the input space margins and the logit margins in robust models -- for efficient detection of vulnerable samples. First, we establish that margin consistency is a necessary and sufficient condition to use a model's logit margin as a score for identifying non-robust samples. Next, through comprehensive empirical analysis of various robustly trained models on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, we show that they indicate high margin consistency with a strong correlation between their input space margins and the logit margins. Then, we show that we can effectively use the logit margin to confidently detect brittle decisions with such models. Finally, we address cases where the model is not sufficiently margin-consistent by learning a pseudo-margin from the feature representation. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging deep representations to efficiently assess adversarial vulnerability in deployment scenarios.

DeTrack: In-model Latent Denoising Learning for Visual Object Tracking
Previous visual object tracking methods employ image-feature regression models or coordinate autoregression models for bounding box prediction. Image-feature regression methods heavily depend on matching results and do not utilize positional prior, while the autoregressive approach can only be trained using bounding boxes available in the training set, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance during testing with unseen data. Inspired by the diffusion model, denoising learning enhances the model's robustness to unseen data. Therefore, We introduce noise to bounding boxes, generating noisy boxes for training, thus enhancing model robustness on testing data.  We propose a new paradigm to formulate the visual object tracking problem as a denoising learning process. However, tracking algorithms are usually asked to run in real-time, directly applying the diffusion model to object tracking would severely impair tracking speed. Therefore, we decompose the denoising learning process into every denoising block within a model, not by running the model multiple times. That means our denoising process requires only a single forward propagation of our model, and thus we summarize the proposed paradigm as an in-model latent denoising learning process. Specifically, we propose a denoising Vision Transformer (ViT), which is composed of multiple denoising blocks. In the denoising block, template and search embeddings are projected into every denoising block as conditions. A denoising block is responsible for removing the noise in a predicted bounding box, and multiple stacked denoising blocks cooperate to accomplish the whole denoising process. Subsequently, we utilize image features and trajectory information to refine the denoised bounding box. Besides, we also  utilize trajectory memory and visual memory to improve tracking stability. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive performance on several challenging datasets. The proposed in-model latent denoising tracker achieve real-time speed through a single forward pass, rendering denoising learning applicable in the visual object tracking community.

DEX: Data Channel Extension for Efficient CNN Inference on Tiny AI Accelerators
Tiny machine learning (TinyML) aims to run ML models on small devices and is increasingly favored for its enhanced privacy, reduced latency, and low cost. Recently, the advent of tiny AI accelerators has revolutionized the TinyML field by significantly enhancing hardware processing power. These accelerators, equipped with multiple parallel processors and dedicated per-processor memory instances, offer substantial performance improvements over traditional microcontroller units (MCUs). However, their limited data memory often necessitates downsampling input images, resulting in accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we propose Data channel EXtension (DEX), a novel approach for efficient CNN execution on tiny AI accelerators. DEX incorporates additional spatial information from original images into input images through patch-wise even sampling and channel-wise stacking, effectively extending data across input channels. By leveraging underutilized processors and data memory for channel extension, DEX facilitates parallel execution without increasing inference latency. Our evaluation with four models and four datasets on tiny AI accelerators demonstrates that this simple idea improves accuracy on average by 3.1%p while keeping the inference latency the same on the AI accelerator.

DFA-GNN: Forward Learning of Graph Neural Networks by Direct Feedback Alignment
Graph neural networks (GNNs) are recognized for their strong performance across various applications, with the backpropagation (BP) algorithm playing a central role in the development of most GNN models. However, despite its effectiveness, BP has limitations that challenge its biological plausibility and affect the efficiency, scalability and parallelism of training neural networks for graph-based tasks. While several non-backpropagation (non-BP) training algorithms, such as the direct feedback alignment (DFA), have been successfully applied to fully-connected and convolutional network components for handling Euclidean data, directly adapting these non-BP frameworks to manage non-Euclidean graph data in GNN models presents significant challenges. These challenges primarily arise from the violation of the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in graph data and the difficulty in accessing prediction errors for all samples (nodes) within the graph. To overcome these obstacles, in this paper we propose DFA-GNN, a novel forward learning framework tailored for GNNs with a case study of semi-supervised learning. The proposed method breaks the limitations of BP by using a dedicated forward training mechanism. Specifically, DFA-GNN extends the principles of DFA to adapt to graph data and unique architecture of GNNs, which incorporates the information of graph topology into the feedback links to accommodate the non-Euclidean characteristics of graph data. Additionally, for semi-supervised graph learning tasks, we developed a pseudo error generator that spreads residual errors from training data to create a pseudo error for each unlabeled node. These pseudo errors are then utilized to train GNNs using DFA. Extensive experiments on 10 public benchmarks reveal that our learning framework outperforms not only previous non-BP methods but also the standard BP methods, and it exhibits excellent robustness against various types of noise and attacks.

DG-SLAM: Robust Dynamic Gaussian Splatting SLAM with Hybrid Pose Optimization
Achieving robust and precise pose estimation in dynamic scenes is a significant research challenge in Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Recent advancements integrating Gaussian Splatting into SLAM systems have proven effective in creating high-quality renderings using explicit 3D Gaussian models, significantly improving environmental reconstruction fidelity. However, these approaches depend on a static environment assumption and face challenges in dynamic environments due to inconsistent observations of geometry and photometry. To address this problem, we propose DG-SLAM, the first robust dynamic visual SLAM system grounded in 3D Gaussians, which provides precise camera pose estimation alongside high-fidelity reconstructions.  Specifically, we propose effective strategies, including motion mask generation, adaptive Gaussian point management, and a hybrid camera tracking algorithm to improve the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DG-SLAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, map reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis in dynamic scenes, outperforming existing methods meanwhile preserving real-time rendering ability.

DiChaViT: Diverse Representations Boosts Channel-Adaptive Vision Transformers
Multi-Channel Imaging (MCI) contains an array of challenges for encoding useful feature representations not present in traditional images.  For example, images from two different satellites may both contain RGB channels, but the remaining channels can be different for each imaging source.  Thus, MCI models must support a variety of channel configurations at test time.  Recent work has extended traditional visual encoders for MCI, such as Vision Transformers (ViT), by supplementing pixel information with an encoding representing the channel configuration.  However, these methods treat each channel equally, i.e., they do not consider the unique properties of each channel type, which can result in needless and potentially harmful redundancies in the learned features.  For example, if RGB channels are always present, the other channels can focus on extracting information that cannot be captured by the RGB channels.  To this end, we propose DiChaViT, which aims to enhance the diversity in the learned features of MCI-ViT models. This is achieved through a novel channel sampling strategy that encourages the selection of more distinct channel sets for training. Additionally, we employ regularization and initialization techniques to increase the likelihood that new information is learned from each channel. Many of our improvements are architecture agnostic and could be incorporated into new architectures as they are developed.Experiments on both satellite and cell microscopy datasets, CHAMMI, JUMP-CP, and So2Sat, report DiChaViT yields a 1.5-5.0% gain over the state-of-the-art.

DiffAug: A Diffuse-and-Denoise Augmentation for Training Robust Classifiers
We introduce DiffAug, a simple and efficient diffusion-based augmentation technique to train image classifiers for the crucial yet challenging goal of improved classifier robustness. Applying DiffAug to a given example consists of one forward-diffusion step followed by one reverse-diffusion step. Using both ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer architectures, we comprehensively evaluate classifiers trained with DiffAug and demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of single-step reverse diffusion in improving robustness to covariate shifts, certified adversarial accuracy and out of distribution detection. When we combine DiffAug with other augmentations such as AugMix and DeepAugment we demonstrate further improved robustness. Finally, building on this approach, we also improve classifier-guided diffusion wherein we observe improvements in: (i) classifier-generalization, (ii) gradient quality (i.e., improved perceptual alignment) and (iii) image generation performance. We thus introduce a computationally efficient technique for training with improved robustness that does not require any additional data, and effectively complements existing augmentation approaches.

Diffeomorphic interpolation for efficient persistence-based topological optimization
Topological Data Analysis (TDA) provides a pipeline to extract quantitative and powerful topological descriptors from structured objects. This enables the definition of topological loss functions, which assert to which extent a given object exhibits some topological properties. One can then use these losses to perform topological optimization via gradient descent routines. While theoretically sounded, topological optimization faces an important challenge: gradients tend to be extremely sparse, in the sense that the loss function typically depends (locally) on only very few coordinates of the input object, yielding dramatically slow optimization schemes in practice. In this work, focusing on the central case of topological optimization for point clouds, we propose to overcome this limitation using diffeomorphic interpolation, turning sparse gradients into smooth vector fields defined on the whole space. In particular, this approach combines efficiently with subsampling techniques routinely used in TDA, as the diffeomorphism derived from the gradient computed on the subsample can be used to update the coordinates of the full and possibly large input object. We then illustrate the usefulness of our approach on black-box autoencoder (AE) regularization, where we aim at applying some topological priors on the latent spaces associated to fixed, black-box AE models without modifying their (unknown) architectures and parameters. We empirically show that, while vanilla topological optimization has to be re-run every time that new data comes out of the black-box models, learning a diffeomorphic flow can be done once and then re-applied to new data in linear time. Moreover, reverting the flow allows us to generate data by sampling the topologically-optimized latent space directly, allowing for better interpretability of the model.

Differentially Private Equivalence Testing for Continuous Distributions and Application
We present the first algorithm for testing equivalence  between two continuous distributions using differential privacy (DP). Our algorithm is a private version of the algorithm of Diakonikolas et al. The algorithm of Diakonikolas et al uses the data itself to repeatedly discretize the real line so that --- when the two distributions are far apart in ${\cal A}_k$-norm --- one of the discretized distributions exhibits large $L_2$-norm difference; and upon repeated sampling such large gap would be detected. Designing its private analogue poses two difficulties. First, our DP algorithm can not resample new datapoints as a change to a single datapoint may lead to a very large change in the descretization of the real line. In contrast, the (sorted) index of the discretization point changes only by $1$ between neighboring instances, and so we use a novel algorithm that set the discretization points using random Bernoulli noise, resulting in only a few buckets being affected under the right coupling. Second, our algorithm, which doesn't resample data, requires we also revisit the utility analysis of the original algorithm and prove its correctness w.r.t. the original sorted data; a problem we tackle using sampling a subset of Poisson-drawn size from each discretized bin. Lastly, since any distribution can be reduced to a continuous distribution, our algorithm is successfully carried to multiple other families of distributions and thus has numerous applications.

Differentially Private Graph Diffusion with Applications in Personalized PageRanks
Graph diffusion, which iteratively propagates real-valued substances among the graph, is used in numerous graph/network-involved applications. However, releasing diffusion vectors may reveal sensitive linking information in the data such as transaction information in financial network data. However, protecting the privacy of graph data is challenging due to its interconnected nature.    This work proposes a novel graph diffusion framework with edge-level different privacy guarantees by using noisy diffusion iterates.    The algorithm injects Laplace noise per diffusion iteration and adopts a degree-based thresholding function to mitigate the high sensitivity induced by low-degree nodes. Our privacy loss analysis is based on Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI), which to our best knowledge, is the first effort that analyzes PABI with Laplace noise and provides relevant applications.    We also introduce a novel $\infty$-Wasserstein distance tracking method, which tightens the analysis of privacy leakage and makes PABI more applicable in practice.     We evaluate this framework by applying it to Personalized Pagerank computation for ranking tasks. Experiments on real-world network data demonstrate the superiority of our method under stringent privacy conditions.

Differentially Private Set Representations
We study the problem of differentially private (DP) mechanisms for representingsets of size $k$ from a large universe.Our first construction creates$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP representations with error probability of $1/(e^\epsilon + 1)$ using space at most $1.05 k \epsilon$ bits wherethe time to construct a representation is $O(k \log(1/\delta))$ while decoding time is $O(\log(1/\delta))$.We also present a second algorithm for pure $\epsilon$-DP representations with the same error using space at most $k \epsilon$ bits, but requiring large decoding times.Our algorithms match the lower bounds on privacy-utility trade-offs (including constants but ignoring $\delta$ factors) and we also present a new space lower boundmatching our constructions up to small constant factors.To obtain our results, we design a new approach embedding sets into random linear systemsdeviating from most prior approaches that inject noise into non-private solutions.

DiffGS: Functional Gaussian Splatting Diffusion
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown convincing performance in rendering speed and fidelity, yet the generation of Gaussian Splatting remains a challenge due to its discreteness and unstructural nature. In this work, we propose DiffGS, a general Gaussian generator based on latent diffusion models. DiffGS is a powerful and efficient 3D generative model which is capable of generating Gaussian primitives at arbitrary numbers for high-fidelity rendering with rasterization. The key insight is to disentangledly represent Gaussian Splatting via three novel functions to model Gaussian probabilities, colors and transforms. Through the novel disentangling of 3DGS, we represent the discrete and unstructual 3DGS with continuous Gaussian Splatting functions, where we then train a latent diffusion model with the target of generating these Gaussian Splatting functions both unconditionally and conditionally. Meanwhile, we introduce a discretization algorithm to extract Gaussians at arbitrary numbers from the generated functions via octree-guided sampling and optimization. We explore DiffGS for various tasks, including unconditional generation, conditional generation from text, image, and partial 3DGS, as well as Point-to-Gaussian generation. We believe that DiffGS provides a new direction for flexibly modeling and generating Gaussian Splatting.

DiffHammer: Rethinking the Robustness of Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification
Diffusion-based purification has shown impressive robustness as an emerging adversarial defense. However, concerns have been raised regarding whether this robustness results from potentially insufficient evaluation. Our research reveals that EoT-based $N+1$ attacks encounter limitations due to the gradient dilemma phenomenon, which leads to an underestimation of the threat posed by resubmit attacks. To address this, we propose a sufficient and efficient attack named DiffHammer. We advocate the use of $N$-time evaluations to accurately quantify risk in practice and to enhance attack efficiency. We further bolster DiffHammer with an EM-based attack that bypasses the gradient dilemma by identifying and attacking vulnerable purification clusters. Our comprehensive experiments validate that DiffHammer can discover more at-least-once adversarial samples with a $2\times$ speedup. By mitigating the impact of the gradient dilemma on evaluation, the reliability of diffusion-based purification is called into question.

DiffLight: A Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion Model for Traffic Signal Control with Missing Data
The application of reinforcement learning in traffic signal control (TSC) has been extensively researched and yielded notable achievements. Most of the existing works for TSC assume that all the traffic conditions surrounding the study intersections can be collected completely and continuously by the deployed sensors. However, due to the lack and error of sensors, data-missing scenarios often occur, leading to the assumption not to be held in practice. To meet the needs of practical applications, in this paper, we study the problem of TSC with missing data in the offline setting. To this end, we propose DiffLight, a conditional diffusion model, unifying the two tasks within this problem, i.e., traffic data imputation and decision-making tasks. Specifically, we introduce the partial rewards conditioned diffusion to avoid confusion about padded missing rewards. Meanwhile, the noise model is designed as a spatial-temporal transformer architecture to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies between intersections. Additionally, we propose the diffusion communication mechanism to enable communication and promote coordinated control among intersections. Extensive experiments on five datasets with different data-missing scenarios demonstrate that DiffLight is an effective controller to address TSC with missing data.

DiffNorm: Self-Supervised Normalization for Non-autoregressive Speech-to-speech Translation
Non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) are recently applied in direct speech-to-speech translation systems, which convert speech across different languages without intermediate text data. Although NATs generate high-quality outputs and offer faster inference than autoregressive models, they tend to produce incoherent and repetitive results due to complex data distribution (e.g., acoustic and linguistic variations in speech). In this work, we introduce DiffNorm, a diffusion-based normalization strategy that simplifies data distributions for training NAT models. After training with a self-supervised noise estimation objective, DiffNorm constructs normalized target data by denoising synthetically corrupted speech features. Additionally, we propose to regularize NATs with classifier-free guidance, improving model robustness and translation quality by randomly dropping out source information during training. Our strategies result in a notable improvement of about $+7$ ASR-BLEU for English-Spanish (En-Es) translation and $+2$ ASR-BLEU for English-French (En-Fr) on the CVSS benchmark, while attaining over $14\times$ speedup for En-Es and $5 \times$ speedup for En-Fr translations compared to autoregressive baselines.

DiffPO: A causal diffusion model for predicting potential outcomes of treatments
Predicting potential outcomes (POs) of interventions from observational data is crucial for decision-making in medicine, but the task is also challenging due to the fundamental problem of causal inference. Existing methods are commonly designed for conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation where POs are only auxiliary quantities; yet, in finite samples, such methods tend to underperform at predicting POs. In this paper, we propose a novel causal diffusion model for predicting POs. Specifically, we leverage a tailored conditional denoising diffusion model to learn complex distributions of POs, where we account for the causal structure of the task (i.e., adjust for the covariate shift across treated vs. non-treated individuals) through our orthogonal diffusion loss designed for the problem with finite samples. A particular strength of our method is that it is highly flexible: it can handle a wider range of settings from causal inference, such as (i) binary and continuous treatments, (ii) single and multiple outcomes, and (iii) different causal quantities (e.g., POs but also CATE). Across a wide range of experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

DiffSF: Diffusion Models for Scene Flow Estimation
Scene flow estimation is an essential ingredient for a variety of real-world applications, especially for autonomous agents, such as self-driving cars and robots. While recent scene flow estimation approaches achieve a reasonable accuracy, their applicability to real-world systems additionally benefits from a reliability measure. Aiming at improving accuracy while additionally providing an estimate for uncertainty, we propose DiffSF that combines transformer-based scene flow estimation with denoising diffusion models. In the diffusion process, the ground truth scene flow vector field is gradually perturbed by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse process, starting from randomly sampled Gaussian noise, the scene flow vector field prediction is recovered by conditioning on a source and a target point cloud. We show that the diffusion process greatly increases the robustness of predictions compared to prior approaches resulting in state-of-the-art performance on standard scene flow estimation benchmarks. Moreover, by sampling multiple times with different initial states, the denoising process predicts multiple hypotheses, which enables measuring the output uncertainty, allowing our approach to detect a majority of the inaccurate predictions. The code can be found in the supplemental material and will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

DiffuBox: Refining 3D Object Detection with Point Diffusion
Ensuring robust 3D object detection and localization is crucial for many applications in robotics and autonomous driving. Recent models, however, face difficulties in maintaining high performance when applied to domains with differing sensor setups or geographic locations, often resulting in poor localization accuracy due to domain shift. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion-based box refinement approach. This method employs a domain-agnostic diffusion model, conditioned on the LiDAR points surrounding a coarse bounding box, to simultaneously refine the box's location, size, and orientation. We evaluate this approach under various domain adaptation settings, and our results reveal significant improvements across different datasets, object classes and detectors.

DiffuLT: Diffusion for Long-tail Recognition Without External Knowledge
This paper introduces a novel pipeline for long-tail (LT) recognition that diverges from conventional strategies. Instead, it leverages the long-tailed dataset itself to generate a balanced proxy dataset without utilizing external data or model. We deploy a diffusion model trained from scratch on only the long-tailed dataset to create this proxy and verify the effectiveness of the data produced. Our analysis identifies approximately-in-distribution (AID) samples, which slightly deviate from the real data distribution and incorporate a blend of class information, as the crucial samples for enhancing the generative model's performance in long-tail classification. We promote the generation of AID samples during the training of a generative model by utilizing a feature extractor to guide the process and filter out detrimental samples during generation. Our approach, termed Diffusion model for Long-Tail recognition (DiffuLT), represents a pioneer application of generative models in long-tail recognition. DiffuLT achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT, surpassing leading competitors by significant margins. Comprehensive ablations enhance the interpretability of our pipeline. Notably, the entire generative process is conducted without relying on external data or pre-trained model weights, which leads to its generalizability to real-world long-tailed scenarios.

DiffuPac: Contextual Mimicry in Adversarial Packets Generation via Diffusion Model
In domains of cybersecurity, recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have significantly enhanced Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), improving the effectiveness of cybersecurity operations. However, attackers have also leveraged ML/DL to develop sophisticated models that generate adversarial packets capable of evading NIDS detection. Consequently, defenders must study and analyze these models to prepare for the evasion attacks that exploit NIDS detection mechanisms. Unfortunately, conventional generation models often rely on unrealistic assumptions about attackers' knowledge of NIDS components, making them impractical for real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we present DiffuPac, a first-of-its-kind generation model designed to generate adversarial packets that evade detection without relying on specific NIDS components. DiffuPac integrates a pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with diffusion model, which, through its capability for conditional denoising and classifier-free guidance, effectively addresses the real-world constraint of limited attacker knowledge. By concatenating malicious packets with contextually relevant normal packets and applying targeted noising only to the malicious packets, DiffuPac seamlessly blends adversarial packets into genuine network traffic. Through evaluations on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DiffuPac achieves strong evasion capabilities against sophisticated NIDS, outperforming conventional methods by 8.83 percentage points while preserving the attack functionality and practicality of the generated adversarial packets.

DiffuserLite: Towards Real-time Diffusion Planning
Diffusion planning has been recognized as an effective decision-making paradigm in various domains. The capability of generating high-quality long-horizon trajectories makes it a promising research direction. However, existing diffusion planning methods suffer from low decision-making frequencies due to the expensive iterative sampling cost. To alleviate this, we introduce DiffuserLite, a super fast and lightweight diffusion planning framework, which employs a planning refinement process (PRP) to generate coarse-to-fine-grained trajectories, significantly reducing the modeling of redundant information and leading to notable increases in decision-making frequency. Our experimental results demonstrate that DiffuserLite achieves a decision-making frequency of $122.2$Hz ($112.7$x faster than predominant frameworks) and reaches state-of-the-art performance on D4RL, Robomimic, and FinRL benchmarks. In addition, DiffuserLite can also serve as a flexible plugin to increase the decision-making frequency of other diffusion planning algorithms, providing a structural design reference for future works. More details and visualizations are available at https://diffuserlite.github.io/.

Diffusing Differentiable Representations
We introduce a novel, training-free method to sample through differentiable functions using pretrained diffusion models. Rather than merely mode finding, our method achieves sampling by pulling back the dynamics of the reverse time process from the image space to the parameter space and updating the parameters according to this pulled-back process. We identify an implicit constraint on the samples from the forward process and demonstrate that addressing this constraint improves the consistency and detail of the generated objects. Our method yields significant improvements in both the quality and diversity of generated implicit neural representations for images, panoramas, and 3D NeRFs compared to existing techniques. The proposed method can generalize to a wide range of differentiable representations, expanding the scope of problems that diffusion models can be applied to.

Diffusion4D: Fast Spatial-temporal Consistent 4D generation via Video Diffusion Models
The availability of large-scale multimodal datasets and advancements in diffusion models have significantly accelerated progress in 4D content generation. Most prior approaches rely on multiple image or video diffusion models, utilizing score distillation sampling for optimization or generating pseudo novel views for direct supervision. However, these methods are hindered by slow optimization speeds and multi-view inconsistency issues. Spatial and temporal consistency in 4D geometry has been extensively explored respectively in 3D-aware diffusion models and traditional monocular video diffusion models. Building on this foundation, we propose a strategy to migrate the temporal consistency in video diffusion models to the spatial-temporal consistency required for 4D generation. Specifically, we present a novel framework, \textbf{Diffusion4D}, for efficient and scalable 4D content generation. Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset, we develop a 4D-aware video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of dynamic 3D assets. To control the dynamic strength of these assets, we introduce a 3D-to-4D motion magnitude metric as guidance. Additionally, we propose a novel motion magnitude reconstruction loss and 3D-aware classifier-free guidance to refine the learning and generation of motion dynamics. After obtaining orbital views of the 4D asset, we perform explicit 4D construction with Gaussian splatting in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generation efficiency and 4D geometry consistency across various prompt modalities. We will release all codes and the dataset.

Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator
Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in addressing complex decision-making and control tasks. However, in most traditional RL algorithms, the policy is typically parameterized as a diagonal Gaussian distribution with learned mean and variance, which constrains their capability to acquire complex policies. In response to this problem, we propose an online RL algorithm termed diffusion actor-critic with entropy regulator (DACER). This algorithm conceptualizes the reverse process of the diffusion model as a novel policy function and leverages the capability of the diffusion model to fit multimodal distributions, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of the policy. Since the distribution of the diffusion policy lacks an analytical expression, its entropy cannot be determined analytically. To mitigate this, we propose a method to estimate the entropy of the diffusion policy utilizing Gaussian mixture model. Building on the estimated entropy, we can learn a parameter $\alpha$ that modulates the degree of exploration and exploitation. Parameter $\alpha$ will be employed to adaptively regulate the variance of the added noise, which is applied to the action output by the diffusion model. Experimental trials on MuJoCo benchmarks and a multimodal task demonstrate that the DACER algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in most MuJoCo control tasks while exhibiting a stronger representational capacity of the diffusion policy.

Diffusion-based Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is an approach to facilitate the learning process of agents by structuring tasks in a sequence of increasing complexity. Despite its potential, many existing CRL methods struggle to efficiently guide agents toward desired outcomes, particularly in the absence of domain knowledge. This paper introduces DiCuRL (Diffusion Curriculum Reinforcement Learning), a novel method that leverages conditional diffusion models to generate curriculum goals. To estimate how close an agent is to achieving its goal, our method uniquely incorporates a $Q$-function and a trainable reward function based on Adversarial Intrinsic Motivation within the diffusion model. Furthermore, it promotes exploration through the inherent noising and denoising mechanism present in the diffusion models and is environment-agnostic. This combination allows for the generation of challenging yet achievable goals, enabling agents to learn effectively without relying on domain knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiCuRL in three different maze environments simulated in MuJoCo, where it outperforms or matches nine state-of-the-art CRL algorithms from the literature.

Diffusion-based Layer-wise Semantic Reconstruction for Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution Detection
Unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify out-of-domain data by learning only from unlabeled In-Distribution (ID) training samples, which is crucial for developing a safe real-world machine learning system. Current reconstruction-based method provides a good alternative approach, by measuring the reconstruction error between the input and its corresponding generative counterpart in the pixel/feature space. However, such generative methods face the key dilemma, $i.e.$, improving the reconstruction power of the generative model, while keeping compact representation of the ID data. To address this issue, we propose the diffusion-based layer-wise semantic reconstruction approach for unsupervised OOD detection. The innovation of our approach is that we leverage the diffusion model's intrinsic data reconstruction ability to distinguish ID samples from OOD samples in the latent feature space. Moreover, to set up a comprehensive and discriminative feature representation, we devise a multi-layer semantic feature extraction strategy. Through distorting the extracted features with Gaussian noises and applying the diffusion model for feature reconstruction, the separation of ID and OOD samples is implemented according to the reconstruction errors. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks built upon various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of detection accuracy and speed.

Diffusion-based Reinforcement Learning via Q-weighted Variational Policy Optimization
Diffusion models have garnered widespread attention in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for their powerful expressiveness and multimodality. It has been verified that utilizing diffusion policies can significantly improve the performance of RL algorithms in continuous control tasks by overcoming the limitations of unimodal policies, such as Gaussian policies, and providing the agent with enhanced exploration capabilities. However, existing works mainly focus on the application of diffusion policies in offline RL, while their incorporation into online RL has been less investigated. The training objective of the diffusion model, known as the variational lower bound, cannot be optimized directly in online RL due to the unavailability of 'good' samples (actions). This leads to difficulties in conducting diffusion policy improvement. To overcome this, we propose a novel model-free diffusion-based online RL algorithm, Q-weighted Variational Policy Optimization (QVPO). Specifically, we introduce the Q-weighted variational loss, which can be proved to be a tight lower bound of the policy objective in online RL under certain conditions. To fulfill these conditions, the Q-weight transformation functions are introduced for general scenarios. Additionally, to further enhance the exploration capability of the diffusion policy, we design a special entropy regularization term. This entropy term is nontrivial because of the inaccessibility of the log-likelihood in diffusion policies. We also develop an efficient behavior policy to enhance sample efficiency by reducing the variance of the diffusion policy during online interactions.  Consequently, the QVPO algorithm leverages the exploration capabilities and multimodality of diffusion policies, preventing the RL agent from converging to a sub-optimal policy. To verify the effectiveness of QVPO, we conduct comprehensive experiments on MuJoCo continuous control benchmarks. The final results demonstrate that QVPO achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both cumulative reward and sample efficiency.

DiffusionBlend: Learning 3D Image Prior through Position-aware Diffusion Score Blending for 3D Computed Tomography Reconstruction
Diffusion models face significant challenges when employed for large-scale medical image reconstruction in real practice such as 3D Computed Tomography (CT).Due to the demanding memory, time, and data requirements, it is difficult to train a diffusion model directly on the entire volume of high-dimensional data to obtain an efficient 3D diffusion prior. Existing works utilizing diffusion priors on single 2D image slice with hand-crafted cross-slice regularization would sacrifice the z-axis consistency, which results in severe artifacts along the z-axis. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enables learning the 3D image prior through position-aware 3D-patch diffusion score blending for reconstructing large-scale 3D medical images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize a 3D-patch diffusion prior for 3D medical image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on sparse view and limited angle CT reconstructionshow that our DiffusionBlend method significantly outperforms previous methodsand achieves state-of-the-art performanceon real-world CT reconstruction problems with high-dimensional 3D image (i.e., $256 \times 256 \times 500$). Our algorithm also comes with better or comparable computational efficiency than previous state-of-the-art methods.

Diffusion-DICE: In-Sample Diffusion Guidance for Offline Reinforcement Learning
One important property of DIstribution Correction Estimation (DICE) methods is that the solution is the optimal stationary distribution ratio between the optimized and data collection policy. In this work, we show that DICE-based methods can be viewed as a transformation from the behavior distribution to the optimal policy distribution. Based on this, we propose a novel approach, Diffusion-DICE, that directly performs this transformation using diffusion models. We find that the optimal policy's score function can be decomposed into two terms: the behavior policy's score function and the gradient of a guidance term which depends on the optimal distribution ratio. The first term can be obtained from a diffusion model trained on the dataset and we propose an in-sample learning objective to learn the second term. Due to the multi-modality contained in the optimal policy distribution, the transformation in Diffusion-DICE may guide towards those local-optimal modes. We thus generate a few candidate actions and carefully select from them to achieve global-optimum. Different from all other diffusion-based offline RL methods, the \textit{guide-then-select} paradigm in Diffusion-DICE only uses in-sample actions for training and brings minimal error exploitation in the value function. We use a didatic toycase example to show how previous diffusion-based methods fail to generate optimal actions due to leveraging these errors and how Diffusion-DICE successfully avoid that. We then conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to show the strong performance of Diffusion-DICE.

DiffusionFake: Enhancing Generalization in Deepfake Detection via Guided Stable Diffusion
The rapid progress of Deepfake technology has made face swapping highly realistic, raising concerns about the malicious use of fabricated facial content. Existing methods often struggle to generalize to unseen domains due to the diverse nature of facial manipulations. In this paper, we revisit the generation process and identify a universal principle: Deepfake images inherently contain information from both source and target identities, while genuine faces maintain a consistent identity. Building upon this insight, we introduce DiffusionFake, a novel plug-and-play framework that reverses the generative process of face forgeries to enhance the generalization of detection models. DiffusionFake achieves this by injecting the features extracted by the detection model into a frozen pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, compelling it to reconstruct the corresponding target and source images. This guided reconstruction process constrains the detection network to capture the source and target related features to facilitate the reconstruction, thereby learning rich and disentangled representations that are more resilient to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffusionFake significantly improves cross-domain generalization of various detector architectures without introducing additional parameters during inference.

Diffusion Forcing: Next-token Prediction Meets Full-Sequence Diffusion
This paper presents Diffusion Forcing, a new training paradigm where a diffusion model is trained to denoise a set of tokens with independent per-token noise levels. We apply Diffusion Forcing to sequence generative modeling by training a causal next-token prediction model to generate one or several future tokens without fully diffusing past ones. Our approach is shown to combine the strengths of next-token prediction models, such as variable-length generation, with the strengths of full-sequence diffusion models, such as the ability to guide sampling to desirable trajectories. Our method offers a range of additional capabilities, such as (1) rolling-out sequences of continuous tokens, such as video, with lengths past the training horizon, where baselines diverge and (2) new sampling and guiding schemes that uniquely profit from Diffusion Forcing's variable-horizon and causal architecture,  and which lead to marked performance gains in decision-making and planning tasks. In addition to its empirical success, our method is proven to optimize a variational lower bound on the likelihoods of all subsequences of tokens drawn from the true joint distribution.

Diffusion for World Modeling: Visual Details Matter in Atari
World models constitute a promising approach for training reinforcement learning agents in a safe and sample-efficient manner. Recent world models predominantly operate on sequences of discrete latent variables to model environment dynamics. However, this compression into a compact discrete representation may ignore visual details that are important for reinforcement learning. Concurrently, diffusion models have become a dominant approach for image generation, challenging well-established methods modeling discrete latents. Motivated by this paradigm shift, we introduce *DIAMOND* (DIffusion As a Model Of eNvironment Dreams), a reinforcement learning agent trained in a diffusion world model. We analyze the key design choices that are required to make diffusion suitable for world modeling, and demonstrate how improved visual details can lead to improved agent performance. *DIAMOND* achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.46 on the competitive Atari 100k benchmark; a new best for agents trained entirely within a world model. To foster future research on diffusion for world modeling, we release our code, agents and playable world models at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/_diamond.

Diffusion Imitation from Observation
Learning from Observation (LfO) aims to imitate experts by learning from state-only demonstrations without requiring action labels. Existing adversarial imitation learning approaches learn a generator agent policy to produce state transitions that are indistinguishable to a discriminator that learns to classify agent and expert state transitions. Despite its simplicity in formulation, these methods are often sensitive to hyperparameters and brittle to train. Motivated by the recent success of diffusion models in generative modeling, we propose to integrate a diffusion model into the adversarial imitation learning from observation framework. Specifically, we employ a diffusion model to capture expert and agent transitions by generating the next state, given the current state. Then, we reformulate the learning objective to train the diffusion model as a binary classifier and use it to provide ``realness'' rewards for policy learning. Our proposed framework, Diffusion Imitation from Observation (DIFO), demonstrates superior performance in various continuous control domains, including navigation, locomotion, manipulation, and games.

Diffusion-Inspired Truncated Sampler for Text-Video Retrieval
Prevalent text-to-video retrieval methods represent the multi-modality text-video data in a joint embedding space, aiming at bridging the relevant text-video pairs and pulling away irrelevant ones. One main challenge in state-of-the-art retrieval methods lies in the modality gap, which stems from the substantial disparities between text and video and can persist in the joint space. The primary goal of this work is to leverage the power of Diffusion models in modeling the text-video modality gap and uncover two-fold design defects of the Diffusion model for retrieval: The L_2 loss does not fit the ranking problem inherent in text-video retrieval, and the generation quality heavily depends on the varied initial point drawn from the isotropic Gaussian, causing inaccurate retrieval. To this end, we introduce Diffusion-Inspired Truncated Sampler (DITS) that jointly performs progressive alignment and modality gap modeling in the joint embedding space. The key innovation of DITS is to leverage the inherent proximity of text and video embeddings, defining a truncated diffusion flow from the fixed text embedding to the video embedding and alleviating the volatility present in the isotropic Gaussian. Moreover, DITS adopts the contrastive loss to jointly consider the relevant and irrelevant pairs, not only facilitating alignment but also yielding a discriminatively structured embedding. Experiments on five benchmark datasets suggest the state-of-the-art performance of DITS. We empirically find that DITS flexibly adjusts the retrieval scope (Recall@K) over time and also improves the structure of the CLIP embedding space. Code and models will be released.

Diffusion Model-based Numerical Tabular Data Imputation: A Wasserstein Gradient Flow Perspective
Diffusion models (DMs) have gained attention in Missing Data Imputation (MDI), but there remain two long-neglected issues to be addressed: (1). Inaccurate Imputation, which arises from inherently sample-diversification-pursuing generative process of DMs. (2). Difficult Training, which stems from intricate design required for the mask matrix in model training stage. To address these concerns within the realm of numerical tabular datasets, we introduce a novel principled approach termed $\underline{\text{K}}$ernelized $\underline{\text{N}}$egative $\underline{\text{E}}$ntropy-regularized $\underline{\text{W}}$asserstein gradient flow $\underline{\text{Imp}}$utation (KnewImp). Specifically, based on Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF) framework, we first prove that issue (1) stems from the cost functionals implicitly maximized in DM-based MDI are equivalent to the MDI's objective plus diversification-promoting non-negative terms. Based on this, we then design a novel cost functional with diversification-discouraging negative entropy and derive our KnewImp approach within WGF framework and reproducing kernel Hilbert space. After that, we prove that the imputation procedure of KnewImp can be derived from another cost functional related to the joint distribution, eliminating the need for the mask matrix and hence naturally addressing issue (2). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed KnewImp approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Diffusion Models are Certifiably Robust Classifiers
Generative learning, recognized for its effective modeling of data distributions, offers inherent advantages in handling out-of-distribution instances, especially for enhancing robustness to adversarial attacks. Among these, diffusion classifiers, utilizing powerful diffusion models, have demonstrated superior empirical robustness. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of their robustness is still lacking, raising concerns about their vulnerability to stronger future attacks. In this study, we prove that diffusion classifiers possess $O(1)$ Lipschitzness, and establish their certified robustness, demonstrating their inherent resilience. To achieve non-constant Lipschitzness, thereby obtaining much tighter certified robustness, we generalize diffusion classifiers to classify Gaussian-corrupted data. This involves deriving the evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) for these distributions, approximating the likelihood using the ELBO, and calculating classification probabilities via Bayes' theorem. Experimental results show the superior certified robustness of these Noised Diffusion Classifiers (NDCs). Notably, we achieve over 80\% and 70\% certified robustness on CIFAR-10 under adversarial perturbations with \(\ell_2\) norms less than 0.25 and 0.5, respectively, using a single off-the-shelf diffusion model without any additional data.

Diffusion Models With Learned Adaptive Noise
Diffusion models have gained traction as powerful algorithms for synthesizing high-quality images. Central to these algorithms is the diffusion process, a set of equations which maps data to noise in a way that can significantly affect performance. In this paper, we explore whether the diffusionprocess can be learned from data.Our work is grounded in Bayesian inference and seeks to improve log-likelihood estimation by casting the learned diffusion process as an approximate variational posterior that yields a tighter lower bound (ELBO) on the likelihood.A widely held assumption is that the ELBO is invariant to the noise process: our work dispels this assumption and proposes multivariate learned adaptive noise (MuLAN), a learned diffusion process that applies noise at different rates across an image. Our method consists of three components: a multivariate noise schedule, adaptive input-conditional diffusion, and auxiliary variables; these components ensure that the ELBO is no longer invariant to the choice of the noise schedule as in previous works.  Empirically, MuLAN sets a new **state-of-the-art** in density estimation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet while matching the performance of previous state-of-the-art models with **50%** fewer steps.

Diffusion Model with Cross Attention as an Inductive Bias for Disentanglement
Disentangled representation learning strives to extract the intrinsic factors within observed data. Factorizing these representations in an unsupervised manner is notably challenging and usually requires tailored loss functions or specific structural designs. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective and framework, demonstrating that diffusion models with cross-attention can serve as a powerful inductive bias to facilitate the learning of disentangled representations. We propose to encode an image to a set of concept tokens and treat them as the condition of the latent diffusion for image reconstruction, where cross-attention over the concept tokens is used to bridge the interaction between the encoder and diffusion. Without any additional regularization, this framework achieves superior disentanglement performance on the benchmark datasets, surpassing all previous methods with intricate designs. We have conducted comprehensive ablation studies and visualization analysis, shedding light on the functioning of this model. We anticipate that our findings will inspire more investigation on exploring diffusion for disentangled representation learning towards more sophisticated data analysis and understanding.

DiffusionPDE: Generative PDE-Solving under Partial Observation
We introduce a general framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using generative diffusion models. In particular, we focus on the scenarios where we do not have the full knowledge of the scene necessary to apply classical solvers. Most existing forward or inverse PDE approaches perform poorly when the observations on the data or the underlying coefficients are incomplete, which is a common assumption for real-world measurements. In this work, we propose DiffusionPDE that can simultaneously fill in the missing information and solve a PDE by modeling the joint distribution of the solution and coefficient spaces. We show that the learned generative priors lead to a versatile framework for accurately solving a wide range of PDEs under partial observation, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for both forward and inverse directions.

Diffusion Policies creating a Trust Region for Offline Reinforcement Learning
Offline reinforcement learning (RL) leverages pre-collected datasets to train optimal policies. Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL), introducing diffusion models as a powerful and expressive policy class, significantly boosts the performance of offline RL. However, its reliance on iterative denoising sampling to generate actions slows down both training and inference. While several recent attempts have tried to accelerate diffusion-QL, the improvement in training and/or inference speed often results in degraded performance. In this paper, we introduce a dual policy approach, Diffusion Trusted Q-Learning (DTQL), which comprises a diffusion policy for pure behavior cloning and a practical one-step policy. We bridge the two polices by a newly introduced diffusion trust region loss. The diffusion policy maintains expressiveness, while the trust region loss directs the one-step policy to explore freely and seek modes within the region defined by the diffusion policy. DTQL eliminates the need for iterative denoising sampling during both training and inference, making it remarkably computationally efficient. We evaluate its effectiveness and algorithmic characteristics against popular Kullback-Leibler (KL) based distillation methods in 2D bandit scenarios and gym tasks. We then show that DTQL could not only outperform other methods on the majority of the D4RL benchmark tasks but also demonstrate efficiency in training and inference speeds.

Diffusion Policy Attacker: Crafting Adversarial Attacks for Diffusion-based Policies
Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for behavior cloning (BC), leveraging their exceptional ability to model multi-modal distributions. Diffusion policies (DP) have elevated BC performance to new heights, demonstrating robust efficacy across diverse tasks, coupled with their inherent flexibility and ease of implementation. Despite the increasing adoption of Diffusion Policies (DP) as a foundation for policy generation, the critical issue of safety remains largely unexplored. While previous attempts have targeted deep policy networks, DP used diffusion models as the policy network, making it ineffective to be attacked using previous methods because of its chained structure and randomness injected. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive examination of DP safety concerns by introducing adversarial scenarios, encompassing offline and online attacks, global and patch-based attacks. We propose DP-Attacker, a suite of algorithms that can craft effective adversarial attacks across all aforementioned scenarios. We conduct attacks on pre-trained diffusion policies across various manipulation tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DP-Attacker has the capability to significantly decrease the success rate of DP for all scenarios. Particularly in offline scenarios, we exhibit the generation of highly transferable perturbations applicable to all frames. Furthermore, we illustrate the creation of adversarial physical patches that, when applied to the environment, effectively deceive the model. Video results areput in: https://sites.google.com/view/dp-attacker-videos/.

Diffusion Priors for Variational Image Denoising
Real-world noise removal is crucial in low-level computer vision. Due to the remarkable generation capabilities of diffusion models, recent attention has shifted towards leveraging diffusion priors for image restoration tasks. However, existing diffusion priors-based methods either consider simple noise types or rely on approximate posterior estimation, limiting their effectiveness in addressing structured and signal-dependent noise commonly found in real-world images. In this paper, we build upon diffusion priors and propose adaptive likelihood estimation and MAP inference during the reverse diffusion process to tackle real-world noise. We introduce an independent, non-identically distributed likelihood combined with the noise precision (inverse variance) prior and dynamically infer the precision posterior using variational Bayes during the generation process. Meanwhile, we rectify the estimated noise variance through local Gaussian convolution. The final denoised image is obtained by propagating intermediate MAP solutions that balance the updated likelihood and diffusion prior. Additionally, we explore the local diffusion prior inherent in low-resolution diffusion models, enabling direct handling of high-resolution noisy images. Extensive experiments and analyses on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Diffusion Representation for Reinforcement Learning
Diffusion-based models have achieved notable empirical successes in reinforcement learning (RL) due to their expressiveness in modeling complex distributions. Despite existing methods being promising, the key challenge of extending them for broader real-world applications lies in the computational cost at inference time, i.e., sampling from a diffusion model is considerably slow as it often requires tens to hundreds of iterations to generate even one sample. To circumvent this issue, we propose to leverage the flexibility of diffusion models for RL from a representation learning perspective. In particular, by exploiting the connection between diffusion model and energy-based model, we develop Diff-Rep, a coherent algorithm framework that enables extracting sufficient representations for value functions in Markov decision processes (MDP) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). We further demonstrate how Diff-Rep facilitates efficient policy optimization and practical algorithms while explicitly bypassing the difficulty and inference cost of sampling from the diffusion model. Finally, we provide comprehensive empirical studies to verify the benefits of Diff-Rep in delivering robust and advantageous performance across various benchmarks with both fully and partially observable settings.

Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning
Imitation learning aims to learn a policy from observing expert demonstrations without access to reward signals from environments. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) formulates imitation learning as adversarial learning, employing a generator policy learning to imitate expert behaviors and discriminator learning to distinguish the expert demonstrations from agent trajectories. Despite its encouraging results, GAIL training is often brittle and unstable. Inspired by the recent dominance of diffusion models in generative modeling, this work proposes Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning (DRAIL), which integrates a diffusion model into GAIL, aiming to yield more precise and smoother rewards for policy learning. Specifically, we propose a diffusion discriminative classifier to construct an enhanced discriminator; then, we design diffusion rewards based on the classifier's output for policy learning. We conduct extensive experiments in navigation, manipulation, and locomotion, verifying DRAIL's effectiveness compared to prior imitation learning methods. Moreover, additional experimental results demonstrate the generalizability and data efficiency of DRAIL. Visualized learned reward functions of GAIL and DRAIL suggest that DRAIL can produce more precise and smoother rewards.

Diffusion Tuning: Transferring Diffusion Models via Chain of Forgetting
Diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of generative modeling. However, training a diffusion model is computationally expensive, creating a pressing need to adapt off-the-shelf diffusion models for downstream generation tasks. Current fine-tuning methods focus on parameter-efficient transfer learning but overlook the fundamental transfer characteristics of diffusion models.  In this paper, we investigate the transferability of diffusion models and observe a monotonous chain of forgetting trend of transferability along the reverse process. Based on this observation and novel theoretical insights, we present Diff-Tuning, a frustratingly simple transfer approach that leverages the chain of forgetting tendency. Diff-Tuning encourages the fine-tuned model to retain the pre-trained knowledge at the end of the denoising chain close to the generated data while discarding the other noise side.  We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate Diff-Tuning, including the transfer of pre-trained Diffusion Transformer models to eight downstream generations and the adaptation of Stable Diffusion to five control conditions with ControlNet.  Diff-Tuning achieves a 26% improvement over standard fine-tuning and enhances the convergence speed of ControlNet by 24%. Notably, parameter-efficient transfer learning techniques for diffusion models can also benefit from Diff-Tuning.

Diffusion Twigs with Loop Guidance for Conditional Graph Generation
We introduce a novel score-based diffusion framework named Twigs that incorporates multiple co-evolving flows for enriching conditional generation tasks. Specifically, a central or trunk diffusion process is associated with a primary variable (e.g., graph structure), and additional offshoot or stem processes are dedicated to dependent variables (e.g., graph properties or labels). A new strategy, which we call loop guidance, effectively orchestrates the flow of information between the trunk and the stem processes during sampling. This approach allows us to uncover intricate interactions and dependencies, and unlock new generative capabilities. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate strong performance gains of the proposed method over contemporary baselines in the context of conditional graph generation, underscoring the potential of Twigs in challenging generative tasks such as inverse molecular design.

Diffusion Unlearning Optimization for Robust and Safe Text-to-Image Models
Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models have greatly benefited from large-scale datasets, but they also pose significant risks due to the potential generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this issue, researchers proposed unlearning techniques that attempt to induce the model to unlearn potentially harmful prompts. However, these methods are easily bypassed by adversarial attacks, making them unreliable for ensuring the safety of generated images. In this paper, we propose Diffusion Unlearning Optimization (DUO), a novel framework for removing NSFW content from T2I models while preserving their performance on unrelated topics. DUO employs a preference optimization approach using curated paired image data, ensuring that the model learns to remove unsafe visual concepts while retain unrelated features. Furthermore, we introduce an output-preserving regularization term to maintain the model's generative capabilities on safe content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUO can robustly defend against various state-of-the-art red teaming methods without significant performance degradation on unrelated topics, as measured by FID and CLIP scores. Our work contributes to the development of safer and more reliable T2I models, paving the way for their responsible deployment in both closed-source and open-source scenarios.

DiGRAF: Diffeomorphic Graph-Adaptive Activation Function
In this paper, we propose a novel activation function tailored specifically for graph data in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Motivated by the need for graph-adaptive and flexible activation functions, we introduce DiGRAF, leveraging Continuous Piecewise-Affine Based (CPAB) transformations, which we augment with an additional GNN to learn a graph-adaptive diffeomorphic activation function in an end-to-end manner. In addition to its graph-adaptivity and flexibility, DiGRAF also possesses properties that are widely recognized as desirable for activation functions, such as differentiability, boundness within the domain and computational efficiency. We conduct an extensive set of experiments across diverse datasets and tasks, demonstrating a consistent and superior performance of DiGRAF compared to traditional and graph-specific activation functions, highlighting its effectiveness as an activation function for GNNs.

Dimension-free deterministic equivalents for random feature regression
In this work we investigate the generalization performance of random feature ridge regression (RFRR). Our main contribution is a general deterministic equivalent for the test error of RFRR. Specifically, under a certain concentration property, we show that the test error is well approximated by a closed-form expression that only depends on the feature map eigenvalues. Notably, our approximation guarantee is non-asymptotic, multiplicative, and independent of the feature map dimension---allowing for infinite-dimensional features. We expect this deterministic equivalent to hold broadly beyond our theoretical analysis, and we empirically validate its predictions on various real and synthetic datasets. As an application, we derive sharp excess error rates under standard power-law assumptions of the spectrum and target decay. In particular, we provide a tight result for the smallest number of features achieving optimal minimax error rate.

DiMSUM: Diffusion Mamba - A Scalable and Unified Spatial-Frequency Method for Image Generation
Our approach presents a novel state-space architecture for diffusion models, effectively harnessing spatial and frequency information to enhance the inductive bias towards local features in input images for image generation tasks. While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties with manually-defined scanning orders, especially in the processing of visual data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art results, achieving faster training convergence, and delivering high-quality outputs.

DINTR: Tracking via Diffusion-based Interpolation
Object tracking is a fundamental task in computer vision, requiring the localization of objects of interest across video frames. Diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities in visual generation, making them well-suited for addressing several requirements of the tracking problem. This work proposes a novel diffusion-based methodology to formulate the tracking task. Firstly, their conditional process allows for injecting indications of the target object into the generation process. Secondly, diffusion mechanics can be developed to inherently model temporal correspondences, enabling the reconstruction of actual frames in video. However, existing diffusion models rely on extensive and unnecessary mapping to a Gaussian noise domain, which can be replaced by a more efficient and stable interpolation process. Our proposed interpolation mechanism draws inspiration from classic image-processing techniques, offering a more interpretable, stable, and faster approach tailored specifically for the object tracking task. By leveraging the strengths of diffusion models while circumventing their limitations, our Diffusion-based INterpolation TrackeR (DINTR) presents a promising new paradigm and achieves a superior multiplicity on seven benchmarks across five indicator representations.

DiP-GO: A Diffusion Pruner via Few-step Gradient Optimization
Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of image generation due to their outstanding capabilities. However, these models require substantial computing resources because of the multi-step denoising process during inference. While traditional pruning methods have been employed to optimize these models, the retraining process necessitates large-scale training datasets and extensive computational costs to maintain generalization ability, making it neither convenient nor efficient. Recent studies attempt to utilize the similarity of features across adjacent denoising stages to reduce computational costs through simple and static strategies. However, these strategies cannot fully harness the potential of the similar feature patterns across adjacent timesteps. In this work, we propose a novel pruning method that derives an efficient diffusion model via a more intelligent and differentiable pruner. At the core of our approach is casting the model pruning process into a SubNet search process. Specifically, we first introduce a SuperNet based on standard diffusion via adding some backup connections built upon the similar features. We then construct a plugin pruner network and design optimization losses to identify redundant computation. Finally, our method can identify an optimal SubNet through few-step gradient optimization and a simple post-processing procedure. We conduct extensive experiments on various diffusion models including Stable Diffusion series and DiTs. Our DiP-GO approach achieves 4.4 x speedup for SD-1.5 without any loss of accuracy, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Direct3D: Scalable Image-to-3D Generation via 3D Latent Diffusion Transformer
Generating high-quality 3D assets from text and images has long been challenging, primarily due to the absence of scalable 3D representations capable of capturing intricate geometry distributions. In this work, we introduce Direct3D, a native 3D generative model scalable to in-the-wild input images, without requiring a multi-view diffusion model or SDS optimization. Our approach comprises two primary components: a Direct 3D Variational Auto-Encoder (D3D-VAE) and a Direct 3D Diffusion Transformer (D3D-DiT). D3D-VAE efficiently encodes high-resolution 3D shapes into a compact and continuous latent triplane space. Notably, our method directly supervises the decoded geometry using a semi-continuous surface sampling strategy, diverging from previous methods relying on rendered images as supervision signals. D3D-DiT models the distribution of encoded 3D latents and is specifically designed to fuse positional information from the three feature maps of the triplane latent, enabling a native 3D generative model scalable to large-scale 3D datasets. Additionally, we introduce an innovative image-to-3D generation pipeline incorporating semantic and pixel-level image conditions, allowing the model to produce 3D shapes consistent with the provided conditional image input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our large-scale pre-trained Direct3D over previous image-to-3D approaches, achieving significantly better generation quality and generalization ability, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art for 3D content creation.

Direct Consistency Optimization for Robust Customization of Text-to-Image Diffusion models
Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, when fine-tuned on a few personal images, can generate visuals with a high degree of consistency. However, such fine-tuned models are not robust; they often fail to compose with concepts of pretrained model or other fine-tuned models. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning objective, dubbed Direct Consistency Optimization, which controls the deviation between fine-tuning and pretrained models to retain the pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments on subject and style customization, we demonstrate that our method positions itself on a superior Pareto frontier between subject (or style) consistency and image-text alignment over all previous baselines; it not only outperforms regular fine-tuning objective in image-text alignment, but also shows higher fidelity to the reference images than the method that fine-tunes with additional prior dataset. More importantly, the models fine-tuned with our method can be merged without interference, allowing us to generate custom subjects in a custom style by composing separately customized subject and style models. Notably, we show that our approach achieves better prompt fidelity and subject fidelity than those post-optimized for merging regular fine-tuned models.

Directional Smoothness and Gradient Methods: Convergence and Adaptivity
We develop new sub-optimality bounds for gradient descent (GD) that depend on the conditioning of the objective along the path of optimization, rather than on global, worst-case constants.  Key to our proofs is directional smoothness, a measure of gradient variation that we use to develop upper-bounds on the objective.  Minimizing these upper-bounds requires solving implicit equations to obtain a sequence of strongly adapted step-sizes; we show that these equations are straightforward to solve for convex quadratics and lead to new guarantees for two classical step-sizes.  For general functions, we prove that the Polyak step-size and normalized GD obtain fast, path-dependent rates despite using no knowledge of the directional smoothness.  Experiments on logistic regression show our convergence guarantees are tighter than the classical theory based on $L$-smoothness.

Director3D: Real-world Camera Trajectory and 3D Scene Generation from Text
Recent advancements in 3D generation have leveraged synthetic datasets with ground truth 3D assets and predefined camera trajectories. However, the potential of adopting real-world datasets, which can produce significantly more realistic 3D scenes, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we delve into the key challenge of the complex and scene-specific camera trajectories found in real-world captures. We introduce Director3D, a robust open-world text-to-3D generation framework, designed to generate both real-world 3D scenes and adaptive camera trajectories. To achieve this, (1) we first utilize a Trajectory Diffusion Transformer, acting as the \emph{Cinematographer}, to model the distribution of camera trajectories based on textual descriptions. Next, a Gaussian-driven Multi-view Latent Diffusion Model serves as the \emph{Decorator}, modeling the image sequence distribution given the camera trajectories and texts. This model, fine-tuned from a 2D diffusion model, directly generates pixel-aligned 3D Gaussians as an immediate 3D scene representation for consistent denoising. Lastly, the 3D Gaussians are further refined by a novel SDS++ loss as the \emph{Detailer}, which incorporates the prior of the 2D diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Director3D outperforms existing methods, offering superior performance in real-world 3D generation.

DisCEdit: Model Editing by Identifying Discriminative Components
Model editing is a growing area of research that is particularly valuable in contexts where modifying key model components, like neurons or filters, can significantly impact the model’s performance. The key challenge lies in identifying important components useful to the model's predictions. We apply model editing to address two active areas of research, Structured Pruning, and Selective Class Forgetting. In this work, we adopt a distributional approach to the problem of identifying important components, leveraging the recently proposed \emph{discriminative filters hypothesis}, which states that well-trained (convolutional) models possess discriminative filters that are essential to prediction.  To do so, we define discriminative ability in terms of the Bayes error rate associated with the feature distributions, which is equivalent to computing the Total Variation (TV) distance between the distributions. However, computing the TV distance is intractable, motivating us to derive novel witness function-based lower bounds on the TV distance that require no assumptions on the underlying distributions; using this bound generalizes prior work such as TVSPrune that relied on unrealistic Gaussianity assumptions on the feature distributions. With these bounds, we are able to discover critical subnetworks responsible for classwise predictions, and derive DisCEdit-SP and DisCEdit-U, algorithms for structured pruning requiring no access to the training data and loss function, and selective forgetting respectively. We apply DisCEdit-U to selective class forgetting on models trained on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, and we show that we can reduce accuracy on a single class by over 80% with a 1.2% improvement in test accuracy on the remaining classes. Similarly, on Structured pruning problems, we obtain 40.8% sparsity on ResNet50 on Imagenet, with only a 2.6% drop in accuracy with minimal fine-tuning.

Discovering plasticity rules that organize and maintain neural circuits
Intrinsic dynamics within the brain can accelerate learning by providing a prior scaffolding for dynamics aligned with task objectives. Such intrinsic dynamics would ideally self-organize and self-sustain in the face of biological noise including synaptic turnover and cell death. An example of such dynamics is the formation of sequences, a ubiquitous motif in neural activity. The sequence-generating circuit in zebra finch HVC provides a reliable timing scaffold for motor output in song and demonstrates a remarkable capacity for unsupervised recovery following perturbation. Inspired by HVC, we seek a local plasticity rule capable of organizing and maintaining sequence-generating dynamics despite continual network perturbations. We adopt a meta-learning approach introduced by Confavreux et al, which parameterizes a learning rule using basis functions constructed from pre- and postsynaptic activity and synapse size, with tunable time constants. Candidate rules are simulated within initially random networks, and their fitness is evaluated according to a loss function that measures the fidelity with which the resulting dynamics encode time. We use this approach to introduce biological noise, forcing meta-learning to find robust solutions. We first show that, in the absence of perturbations, meta-learning identifies a temporally asymmetric generalization of Oja's rule that reliably organizes sparse sequential activity. When synaptic turnover is introduced, the learned rule incorporates a form of homeostasis, better maintaining robust sequential dynamics relative to other previously proposed rules. Additionally, inspired by recent findings demonstrating that the strength of projections from inhibitory interneurons in HVC also dynamically responds to perturbations, we explore the role of inhibitory plasticity in sequence-generating circuits. We find that learned plasticity adjusts both excitation and inhibition in response to manipulations, outperforming rules applied only to excitatory connections. We demonstrate how plasticity acting on both excitatory and inhibitory synapses can better shape excitatory cell dynamics to scaffold timing representations.

DiscoveryWorld: A Virtual Environment for Developing and Evaluating Automated Scientific Discovery Agents
Automated scientific discovery promises to accelerate progress across scientific domains, but evaluating an agent's capacity for end-to-end scientific reasoning is challenging as running real-world experiments is often prohibitively expensive or infeasible. In this work we introduce DiscoveryWorld, a virtual environment that enables benchmarking an agent's ability to perform complete cycles of novel scientific discovery in an inexpensive, simulated, multi-modal, long-horizon, and fictional setting.DiscoveryWorld consists of 24 scientific tasks across three levels of difficulty, each with parametric variations that provide new discoveries for agents to make across runs. Tasks require an agent to form hypotheses, design and run experiments, analyze results, and act on conclusions. Task difficulties are normed to range from straightforward to challenging for human scientists with advanced degrees. DiscoveryWorld further provides three automatic metrics for evaluating performance, including: (1) binary task completion, (2) fine-grained report cards detailing procedural scoring of task-relevant actions, and (3) the accuracy of discovered explanatory knowledge.While simulated environments such as DiscoveryWorld are low-fidelity compared to the real world, we find that strong baseline agents struggle on most DiscoveryWorld tasks, highlighting the utility of using simulated environments as proxy tasks for near-term development of scientific discovery competency in agents.

Discrete Flow Matching
Flow Matching and diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative paradigms for continuous variables such as images and videos. However, their application to high-dimensional discrete data, such as language, has been limited. In this work, we present Discrete Flow Matching, a novel discrete flow paradigm designed specifically for generating discrete data. Discrete Flow Matching offers several key contributions: (i) it works with a general family of probability paths interpolating between source and target distributions; (ii) it allows for a generic formula for sampling from these probability paths using learned posteriors such as the denoiser ($x$-prediction) and noise-prediction ($\epsilon$-prediction); (iii) practically, focusing on specific probability paths defined with different schedulers considerably improves generative perplexity compared to previous discrete diffusion and flow models; and (iv) scaling Discrete Flow Matching models up to 1.7B parameters, we reach 6.7\%\,Pass@1 and 13.4\%\,Pass@10 on HumanEval and 6.7\%\,Pass@1 and 20.6\%\,Pass@10 on 1-shot MBPP coding benchmarks. Our approach is capable of generating high-quality discrete data in a non-autoregressive fashion, significantly closing the gap between autoregressive models and discrete flow models.

Discrete Modeling via Boundary Conditional Diffusion Processes
We present an novel framework for efficiently and effectively extending the powerful continuous diffusion processes to discrete modeling.Previous approaches have suffered from the discrepancy between discrete data and continuous modeling.Our study reveals that the absence of guidance from discrete boundaries in learning probability contours is one of the main reasons.To address this issue, we propose a two-step forward process that first estimates the boundary as a prior distribution and then rescales the forward trajectory to construct a boundary conditional diffusion model.The reverse process is proportionally adjusted to guarantee that the learned contours yield more precise discrete data.Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves strong performance in both language modeling and discrete image generation tasks.In language modeling, our approach surpasses previous state-of-the-art continuous diffusion language models in three translation tasks and a summarization task, while also demonstrating competitive performance compared to auto-regressive transformers. Moreover, our method achieves comparable results to continuous diffusion models when using discrete ordinal pixels and establishes a new state-of-the-art for categorical image generation on the Cifar-10 dataset.

Discrete-state Continuous-time Diffusion for Graph Generation
Graph is a prevalent discrete data structure, whose generation has wide applications such as drug discovery and circuit design. Diffusion generative models, as an emerging research focus, have been applied to graph generation tasks. Overall, according to the space of states and time steps, diffusion generative models can be categorized into discrete-/continuous-state discrete-/continuous-time fashions. In this paper, we formulate the graph diffusion generation in a discrete-state continuous-time setting, which has never been studied in previous graph diffusion models. The rationale of such a formulation is to preserve the discrete nature of graph-structured data and meanwhile provide flexible sampling trade-offs between sample quality and efficiency. Analysis shows that our training objective is closely related to the generation quality and our proposed generation framework enjoys ideal invariant/equivariant properties concerning the permutation of node ordering. Our proposed model shows competitive empirical performance against other state-of-the-art graph generation solutions on various benchmarks while at the same time can flexibly trade off the generation quality and efficiency in the sampling phase.

DisenGCD: A Meta Multigraph-assisted Disentangled Graph Learning Framework for Cognitive Diagnosis
Existing graph learning-based cognitive diagnosis (CD) methods have made relatively good results, but their student, exercise, and concept representations are learned and exchanged in an implicit unified graph, which makes the interaction-agnostic exercise and concept representations be learned poorly, failing to provide high robustness against noise in students' interactions. Besides,  lower-order exercise latent representations obtained in shallow layers are not well explored when learning the student representation. To tackle the issues, this paper suggests a meta multigraph-assisted disentangled graph learning framework for CD (DisenGCD), which learns three types of representations on three disentangled graphs: student-exercise-concept interaction,  exercise-concept relation, and concept dependency graphs, respectively. Specifically,  the latter two graphs are first disentangled from the interaction graph. Then, the student representation is learned from the interaction graph by a devised meta multigraph learning module; multiple learnable propagation paths in this module  enable current student latent representation to access  lower-order exercise latent representations,which can lead to  more effective nad robust student representations learned; the exercise and concept representations are learned on the relation and dependency graphs by graph attention modules. Finally, a novel diagnostic function is devised to handle three disentangled representations for prediction.  Experiments show better performance and robustness of DisenGCD than state-of-the-art CD methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of the disentangled learning framework and meta multigraph module.

Disentangling and mitigating the impact of task similarity for continual learning
Continual learning of partially similar tasks poses a challenge for artificial neural networks, as task similarity presents both an opportunity for knowledge transfer and a risk of interference and catastrophic forgetting.However, it remains unclear how task similarity in input features and readout patterns influences knowledge transfer and forgetting, as well as how they interact with common algorithms for continual learning.Here, we develop a linear teacher-student model with latent structure and show analytically that high input feature similarity coupled with low readout similarity is catastrophic for both knowledge transfer and retention. Conversely, the opposite scenario is relatively benign. Our analysis further reveals that task-dependent activity gating improves knowledge retention at the expense of transfer, while task-dependent plasticity gating does not affect either retention or transfer performance at the over-parameterized limit. In contrast, weight regularization based on the Fisher information metric significantly improves retention, regardless of task similarity, without compromising transfer performance. Nevertheless, its diagonal approximation and regularization in the Euclidean space are much less robust against task similarity. We demonstrate consistent results in a permuted MNIST task with latent variables. Overall, this work provides insights into when continual learning is difficult and how to mitigate it.

Disentangling Interpretable Factors of Variations with Supervised Independent Subspace Principal Component Analysis
Representing high-dimensional data in a meaningful way that aligns with existing knowledge is a central challenge in machine learning, particularly when the goal is to separate distinct subspaces. Traditional linear approaches often fall short in handling multiple subspaces, while deep generative models that capture nonlinear latent spaces typically trade off interpretability for increased complexity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce Supervised Independent Subspace Principal Component Analysis (sisPCA), an innovative extension of PCA to multiple subspaces that disentangles independent signatures in data using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). We elucidate the mathematical connections of sisPCA with self-supervised learning and regularized linear regression. Through comprehensive experiments involving DNA methylation and single-cell RNA sequencing data, we demonstrate sisPCA’s ability to discern and segregate complex latent structures. Our findings also underscore the efficacy of sisPCA in enhancing the interpretability of high-dimensional data analysis.

Disentangling Linear Quadratic Control with Untrusted ML Predictions
Uncertain perturbations in dynamical systems often arise from diverse resources, represented by latent components. The predictions for these components, typically generated by "black-box" machine learning tools, are prone to inaccuracies. To tackle this challenge, we introduce DISC, a novel policy that learns a confidence parameter online to harness the potential of accurate predictions while also mitigating the impact of potential erroneous forecasts.  When predictions are precise, DISC leverages this information to achieve near-optimal performance. Conversely, in the case of significant prediction errors, it still has a worst-case guarantee on its competitive ratio.  We provide competitive ratio bounds for DISC in both a linear mixing framework of latent variables and a broader class of mixing functions. Our results highlight a first-of-its-kind "best-of-both-worlds" integration of machine-learned predictions, thus lead to a near-optimal consistency and robustness tradeoff, which provably improves what can be obtained without learning the confidence parameter. We validate the applicability of DISC across a spectrum of practical scenarios.

Dispelling the Mirage of Progress in Offline MARL through Standardised Baselines and Evaluation
Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is an emerging field with great promise for real-world applications. Unfortunately, the current state of research in offline MARL is plagued by inconsistencies in baselines and evaluation protocols, which ultimately makes it difficult to accurately assess progress, trust newly proposed innovations, and allow researchers to easily build upon prior work. In this paper, we firstly identify significant shortcomings in existing methodologies for measuring the performance of novel algorithms through a representative study of published offline MARL work. Secondly, by directly comparing to this prior work, we demonstrate that simple, well-implemented baselines can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across a wide range of tasks. Specifically, we show that on 35 out of 47 datasets used in prior work (almost 75% of cases), we match or surpass the performance of the current purported SOTA. Strikingly, our baselines often substantially outperform these more sophisticated algorithms.  Finally, we correct for the shortcomings highlighted from this prior work by introducing a straightforward standardised methodology for evaluation and by providing our baseline implementations with statistically robust results across several scenarios, useful for comparisons in future work. Our proposal includes simple and sensible steps that are easy to adopt, which in combination with solid baselines and comparative results, could substantially improve the overall rigour of empirical science in offline MARL moving forward.

Dissect Black Box: Interpreting for Rule-Based Explanations in Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
In high-stakes sectors such as network security, IoT security, accurately distinguishing between normal and anomalous data is critical due to the significant implications for operational success and safety in decision-making. The complexity is exacerbated by the presence of unlabeled data and the opaque nature of black-box anomaly detection models, which obscure the rationale behind their predictions. In this paper, we present a novel method to interpret the decision-making processes of these models, which are essential for detecting malicious activities without labeled attack data. We put forward the Segmentation Clustering Decision Tree (SCD-Tree), designed to dissect and understand the structure of normal data distributions. The SCD-Tree integrates predictions from the anomaly detection model into its splitting criteria, enhancing the clustering process with the model's insights into anomalies. To further refine these segments,  the Gaussian Boundary Delineation (GBD) algorithm is employed to define boundaries within each segmented distribution, effectively delineating normal from anomalous data points. At this point, this approach addresses the curse of dimensionality by segmenting high-dimensional data and ensures resilience to data drift and perturbations through flexible boundary fitting. We transform the intricate operations of anomaly detection into an interpretable rule's format, constructing a comprehensive set of rules for understanding.  Our method's evaluation on diverse datasets and models demonstrates superior explanation accuracy, fidelity, and robustness over existing method, proving its efficacy in environments where interpretability is paramount.

Dissecting the Failure of Invariant Learning on Graphs
Enhancing node-level Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs remains a crucial area. In this paper, we develop a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to theoretically dissect the performance of two prominent invariant learning methods--Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and Variance-Risk Extrapolation (VREx)--in node-level OOD settings. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these methods may struggle to identify invariant features due to the complexities introduced by the message-passing mechanism, which can obscure causal features within a range of neighboring samples. To address this, we propose Cross-environment Intra-class Alignment (CIA), which explicitly eliminates spurious features by aligning representations within the same class, bypassing the need for explicit knowledge of underlying causal patterns. To adapt CIA to node-level OOD scenarios where environment labels are hard to obtain, we further propose CIA-LRA (Localized Reweighting Alignment) that leverages the distribution of neighboring labels to selectively align node representations, effectively distinguishing and preserving invariant features while removing spurious ones, all without relying on environment labels. We theoretically prove CIA-LRA's effectiveness by deriving an OOD generalization error bound based on PAC-Bayesian analysis. Experiments on graph OOD benchmarks validate the superiority of CIA and CIA-LRA, marking a significant advancement in node-level OOD generalization.

Dissecting the Interplay of Attention Paths in a Statistical Mechanics Theory of Transformers
Despite the remarkable empirical performance of Transformers, their theoretical understanding remains elusive. Here, we consider a deep multi-head self-attention network, that is closely related to Transformers yet analytically tractable. We develop a statistical mechanics theory of Bayesian learning in this model, deriving exact equations for the network's predictor statistics under the finite-width thermodynamic limit, i.e., $N,P\rightarrow\infty$, $P/N=\mathcal{O}(1)$, where $N$ is the network width and $P$ is the number of training examples. Our theory shows that the predictor statistics are expressed as a sum of independent kernels, each one pairing different "attention paths", defined as information pathways through different attention heads across layers. The kernels are weighted according to a "task-relevant kernel combination" mechanism that aligns the total kernel with the task labels. As a consequence, this interplay between attention paths enhances generalization performance. Experiments confirm our findings on both synthetic and real-world sequence classification tasks. Finally, our theory explicitly relates the kernel combination mechanism to properties of the learned weights, allowing for a qualitative transfer of its insights to models trained via gradient descent. As an illustration, we demonstrate an efficient size reduction of the network, by pruning those attention heads that are deemed less relevant by our theory.

Distilling Costly Set Functions to Parametric Families
Submodular functions, crucial for various applications, often lack  practical learning methods for their acquisition.  Seemingly unrelated,  learning a scaling from oracles offering graded pairwise preferences (GPC) is  underexplored, despite a rich history in psychometrics. In this paper, we introduce  deep submodular peripteral networks (DSPNs), a novel parametric  family of submodular functions, and methods for their training using a  GPC-ready strategy to connect and then tackle both of the above challenges.  We introduce newly devised GPC-style ``peripteral'' loss which  leverages numerically graded relationships between pairs of objects  (sets in our case). Unlike contrastive learning, our  method utilizes graded comparisons, extracting more nuanced  information than just binary-outcome comparisons, and contrasts sets of any size (not just two). We also  define a novel suite of automatic sampling strategies for training,  including active-learning inspired submodular feedback.  We  demonstrate DSPNs' efficacy in learning submodularity from a costly  target submodular function showing superiority both for experimental design and online streaming applications.

Distributed Least Squares in Small Space via Sketching and Bias Reduction
Matrix sketching is a powerful tool for reducing the size of large data matrices. Yet there are fundamental limitations to this size reduction when we want to recover an accurate estimator for a task such as least square regression. We show that these limitations can be circumvented in the distributed setting by designing sketching methods that minimize the bias of the estimator, rather than its error. In particular, we give a sparse sketching method running in optimal space and current matrix multiplication time, which recovers a nearly-unbiased least squares estimator using two passes over the data. This leads to new communication-efficient distributed averaging algorithms for least squares and related tasks, which directly improve on several prior approaches. Our key novelty is a new bias analysis for sketched least squares, giving a sharp characterization of its dependence on the sketch sparsity. The techniques include new higher moment restricted Bai-Silverstein inequalities, which are of independent interest to the non-asymptotic analysis of deterministic equivalents for random matrices that arise from sketching.

Distributed-Order Fractional Graph Operating Network
We introduce the Distributed-order fRActional Graph Operating Network (DRAGON), a novel continuous Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that incorporates distributed-order fractional calculus. Unlike traditional continuous GNNs that utilize integer-order or single fractional-order differential equations, DRAGON uses a learnable probability distribution over a range of real numbers for the derivative orders. This method allows for a flexible superposition of multiple derivative orders, capturing complex graph feature updating dynamics beyond the reach of conventional models.We provide a comprehensive interpretation of our flexible framework through the lens of a non-Markovian graph random walk, demonstrating its capability to capture intricate dynamics, especially when node feature dynamics are driven by a diffusion process. Furthermore, to highlight the versatility of the DRAGON framework, we conduct empirical evaluations across a range of graph learning tasks. The results consistently demonstrate superior performance when compared to traditional continuous GNN models.

Distributionally Robust Performative Prediction
Performative prediction aims to model scenarios where predictive outcomes subsequently influence the very systems they target. The pursuit of a performative optimum (PO)—minimizing performative risk—is generally reliant on modeling of the distribution map, which characterizes how a deployed ML model alters the data distribution. Unfortunately, inevitable misspecification of the distribution map can lead to a poor approximation of the true PO. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework of distributionally robust performative prediction and study a new solution concept termed as distributionally robust performative optimum (DRPO). We show provable guarantees for DRPO as a robust approximation to the true PO when the nominal distribution map is different from the actual one. Moreover, distributionally robust performative prediction can be reformulated as an augmented performative prediction problem, enabling efficient optimization. The experimental results demonstrate that DRPO offers potential advantages over traditional PO approach when the distribution map is misspecified at either micro- or macro-level.

Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning with Interactive Data Collection: Fundamental Hardness and Near-Optimal Algorithm
The sim-to-real gap, which represents the disparity between training and testing environments, poses a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). A promising approach to addressing this challenge is distributionally robust RL, often framed as a robust Markov decision process (RMDP). In this framework, the objective is to find a robust policy that achieves good performance under the worst-case scenario among all environments within a pre-specified uncertainty set centered around the training environment. Unlike previous work, which relies on a generative model or a pre-collected offline dataset enjoying good coverage of the deployment environment, we tackle robust RL via interactive data collection, where the learner interacts with the training environment only and refines the policy through trial and error. In this robust RL paradigm, two main challenges emerge: managing distributional robustness while striking a balance between exploration and exploitation during data collection. Initially, we establish that sample-efficient learning without additional assumptions is unattainable owing to the curse of support shift; i.e., the potential disjointedness of the distributional supports between the training and testing environments. To circumvent such a hardness result, we introduce the vanishing minimal value assumption to RMDPs with a total-variation (TV) distance robust set, postulating that the minimal value of the optimal robust value function is zero. We prove that such an assumption effectively eliminates the support shift issue for RMDPs with a TV distance robust set, and present an algorithm with a provable sample complexity guarantee. Our work makes the initial step to uncovering the inherent difficulty of robust RL via interactive data collection and sufficient conditions for designing a sample-efficient algorithm accompanied by sharp sample complexity analysis.

Distributional regression: CRPS-error bounds for model fitting, model selection and convex aggregation
Distributional regression aims at estimating the conditional distribution of a target variable given explanatory co-variates. It is a crucial tool for forecasting when a precise uncertainty quantification is required. A popular methodology consists in fitting a parametric model via empirical risk minimization where the risk is measured by the Continuous Rank Probability Score (CRPS). For independent and identically distributed observations, we provide a concentration result for the estimation error and an upper bound for its expectation. Furthermore, we consider model selection performed by minimization of the validation error and provide a concentration bound for the regret. A similar result is proved for convex aggregation of models. Finally, we show that our results may be applied to various models such as EMOS, distributional regression networks, distributional nearest neighbours or distributional random forests and we illustrate our findings on two data sets (QSAR aquatic toxicity and Airfoil self-noise).

Distribution-Aware Data Expansion with Diffusion Models
The scale and quality of a dataset significantly impact the performance of deep models. However, acquiring large-scale annotated datasets is both a costly and time-consuming endeavor. To address this challenge, dataset expansion technologies aim to automatically augment datasets, unlocking the full potential of deep models. Current data expansion techniques include image transformation and image synthesis methods. Transformation-based methods introduce only local variations, leading to limited diversity. In contrast, synthesis-based methods generate entirely new content, greatly enhancing informativeness. However, existing synthesis methods carry the risk of distribution deviations, potentially degrading model performance with out-of-distribution samples. In this paper, we propose DistDiff, a training-free data expansion framework based on the distribution-aware diffusion model. DistDiff constructs hierarchical prototypes to approximate the real data distribution, optimizing latent data points within diffusion models with hierarchical energy guidance. We demonstrate its capability to generate distribution-consistent samples, significantly improving data expansion tasks. DistDiff consistently enhances accuracy across a diverse range of datasets compared to models trained solely on original data. Furthermore, our approach consistently outperforms existing synthesis-based techniques and demonstrates compatibility with widely adopted transformation-based augmentation methods. Additionally, the expanded dataset exhibits robustness across various architectural frameworks.

Distribution Learning with Valid Outputs Beyond the Worst-Case
Generative models at times produce "invalid" outputs, such as images with generation artifacts and unnatural sounds. Validity-constrained distribution learning attempts to address this problem by requiring that the learned distribution have a provably small fraction of its mass in invalid parts of space -- something which standard loss minimization does not always ensure. To this end, a learner in this model can guide the learning via "validity queries", which allow it to ascertain the validity of individual examples. Prior work on this problem takes a worst-case stance, showing that proper learning requires an exponential number of validity queries, and demonstrating an improper algorithm which -- while generating guarantees in a wide-range of settings -- makes a relatively large polynomial number of validity queries. In this work, we take a first step towards characterizing regimes where guaranteeing validity is easier than in the worst-case. We show that when the data distribution lies in the model class and the log-loss is minimized, the number samples required to ensure validity has a weak dependence on the validity requirement. Additionally, we show that when the validity region belongs to a VC-class, a limited number of validity queries are often sufficient.

DiTFastAtten: Accelerate Diffusion Transformers Through Efficient Attention Computation
Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful tool for image and video generation tasks. However, their quadratic computational complexity due to the self-attention mechanism poses a significant challenge, particularly for high-resolution and long video tasks. This paper mitigate the computational bottleneck in DiT models by introducing a novel post-training model compression method. We identify three key redundancies in the attention computation during DiT inference: 1. spatial redundancy, where many attention heads focus on local information; 2. temporal redundancy, with high similarity between neighboring steps' attention outputs; 3. conditional redundancy, where conditional and unconditional inferences exhibit significant similarity. To tackle these redundancies, we propose three techniques: 1. Window Attention with Residual Caching to reduce spatial redundancy; 2. Temporal Similarity Reduction to exploit the similarity between steps; 3. Conditional Redundancy Elimination to skip redundant computations during conditional generation. Our method compresses the model FLOPs to 35\% of the original model. This work offers a practical solution for deploying DiT models in resource-constrained environments.

Diversify, Contextualize, and Adapt: Efficient Entropy Modeling for Neural Image Codec
Designing a fast and effective entropy model is challenging but essential for practical application of neural codecs. Beyond spatial autoregressive entropy models, more efficient backward adaptation-based entropy models have been recently developed. They not only reduce decoding time by using smaller number of modeling steps but also maintain or even improve rate--distortion performance by leveraging more diverse contexts for backward adaptation. Despite their significant progress, we argue that their performance has been limited by the simple adoption of the design convention for forward adaptation: using only a single type of hyper latent representation, which does not provide sufficient contextual information, especially in the first modeling step. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective entropy modeling framework that leverages sufficient contexts for forward adaptation without compromising on bit-rate. Specifically, we introduce a strategy of diversifying hyper latent representations for forward adaptation, i.e., using two additional types of contexts along with the existing single type of context. In addition, we present a method to effectively use the diverse contexts for contextualizing the current elements to be encoded/decoded. By addressing the limitation of the previous approach, our proposed framework leads to significant performance improvements. Experimental results on popular datasets show that our proposed framework consistently improves rate-distortion performance across various bit-rate regions, e.g., 3.73\% BD-rate gain over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Kodak dataset.

Diversity-Driven Synthesis: Enhancing Dataset Distillation through Directed Weight Adjustment
The sharp increase in data-related expenses has motivated research into condensing datasets while retaining the most informative features. Dataset distillation has thus recently come to the fore. This paradigm generates synthetic dataset that are representative enough to replace the original dataset in training a neural network. To avoid redundancy in these synthetic datasets, it is crucial that each element contains unique features and remains diverse from others during the synthesis stage. In this paper, we provide a thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of diversity within synthesized datasets. We argue that enhancing diversity can improve the parallelizable yet isolated synthesizing approach. Specifically, we introduce a novel method that employs dynamic and directed weight adjustment techniques to modulate the synthesis process, thereby maximizing the representativeness and diversity of each synthetic instance. Our method ensures that each batch of synthetic data mirrors the characteristics of a large, varying subset of the original dataset. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, including CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in producing diverse and representative synthetic datasets with minimal computational expense.

Diversity Is Not All You Need: Training A Robust Cooperative Agent Needs Specialist Partners
Partner diversity is known to be crucial for training a robust generalist cooperative agent. In this paper, we show that partner specialization, in addition to diversity, is crucial for the robustness of a downstream generalist agent. We propose a principled method for quantifying both the diversity and specialization of a partner population based on the concept of mutual information. Then, we observe that the recently proposed cross-play minimization (XP-min) technique produces diverse and specialized partners. However, the generated partners are overfit, reducing their usefulness as training partners. To address this, we propose simple methods, based on reinforcement learning and supervised learning, for extracting the diverse and specialized behaviors of XP-min generated partners but not their overfitness. We demonstrate empirically that the proposed method effectively removes overfitness, and extracted populations produce more robust generalist agents compared to the source XP-min populations.

Divide-and-Conquer Posterior Sampling for Denoising Diffusion priors
Recent advancements in solving Bayesian inverse problems have spotlighted denoising diffusion models (DDMs) as effective priors.Although these have great potential, DDM priors yield complex posterior distributions that are challenging to sample from.Existing approaches to posterior sampling in this context address this problem either by retraining model-specific components, leading to stiff and cumbersome methods, or by introducing approximations with uncontrolled errors that affect the accuracy of the produced samples.We present an innovative framework, divide-and-conquer posterior sampling, which leverages the inherent structure of DDMs to construct a sequence of intermediate posteriors that guide the produced samples to the target posterior.Our method significantly reduces the approximation error associated with current techniques without the need for retraining.We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our approach for a wide range of Bayesian inverse problems.

DMPlug: A Plug-in Method for Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models
Pretrained diffusion models (DMs) have recently been popularly used in solving inverse problems (IPs). The existing methods mostly interleave iterative steps in the reverse diffusion process and iterative steps to bring the iterates closer to satisfying the measurement constraint. However, such interleaving methods struggle to produce final results that look like natural objects of interest (i.e., manifold feasibility) and fit the measurement (i.e., measurement feasibility), especially for nonlinear IPs. Moreover, their capabilities to deal with noisy IPs with unknown types and levels of measurement noise are unknown. In this paper, we advocate viewing the reverse process in DMs as a function and propose a novel plug-in method for solving IPs using pretrained DMs, dubbed DMPlug. DMPlug addresses the issues of manifold feasibility and measurement feasibility in a principled manner, and also shows great potential for being robust to unknown types and levels of noise. Through extensive experiments across various IP tasks, including two linear and three nonlinear IPs, we demonstrate that DMPlug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, often by large margins especially for nonlinear IPs.

Do causal predictors generalize better to new domains?
We study how well machine learning models trained on causal features generalize across domains. We consider 16 prediction tasks on tabular datasets covering applications in health, employment, education, social benefits, and politics. Each dataset comes with multiple domains, allowing us to test how well a model trained in one domain performs in another. For each prediction task, we select features that have a causal influence on the target of prediction. Our goal is to test the hypothesis that models trained on causal features generalize better across domains. Without exception, we find that predictors using all available features, regardless of causality, have better in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy than predictors using causal features. Moreover, even the absolute drop in accuracy from one domain to the other is no better for causal predictors than for models that use all features.  In addition, we show that recent causal machine learning methods for domain generalization do not perform better in our evaluation than standard predictors trained on the set of causal features. Likewise, causal discovery algorithms either fail to run or select causal variables that perform no better than our selection. Extensive robustness checks confirm that our findings are stable under variable misclassification.

Do CLIP Models Always Generalize Better than ImageNet Models?
Large vision language models, such as CLIP, are typically considered to exhibit enhanced generalizability under distribution shifts over single-modal models supervised on ImageNet. However, previous evaluation datasets in comparing between CLIP and ImageNet models are variants primarily crafted for models pre-trained on ImageNet, which may not correctly reflect the extent to which CLIP models, e.g., pre-trained on LAION, are robust to spurious correlations. To bridge the gap, we curate a new evaluation dataset named CounterAnimal,  encompassing realistic spurious features commonly found in animal photos. The CounterAnimal dataset consists of a) the common group: comprising animals in common backgrounds, and b) the counter group: including animals in plausible yet unusual backgrounds. The performance drops from the common to counter groups quantify the reliance on spurious background features for animal predictions. Our evaluations reveal that CLIP models, pre-trained on either LAION or OpenAI datasets, exhibit notable performance drops when tested on the counter group. We also observe that ImageNet models can be more robust than CLIP models on CounterAnimal, suggesting that CLIP models do not rely less on spurious features than supervised models. To further solidify our findings, we provide theoretical insights that the CLIP objective cannot offer additional robustness. While our findings suggest that the distribution shifts remain an open problem for CLIP, CounterAnimal also reveals that strategies such as scaling up parameters and high-quality pre-trained data help mitigate the spurious features, laying the foundation for future developments.

Do Counterfactually Fair Image Classifiers Satisfy Group Fairness? -- A Theoretical and Empirical Study
The notion of algorithmic fairness has been actively explored from various aspects of fairness, such as counterfactual fairness (CF) and group fairness (GF). The relationship between CF and GF remains an undiscovered problem, especially in image classification tasks; we often cannot collect counterfactual samples from the existing images (e.g., a photo of the same person but with a different gender). In this paper, we construct new image datasets for evaluating CF using a high-quality image editing method and carefully labeling by human annotators. Our datasets, CelebA-CF and LFW-CF, build upon the popular image GF benchmarks; hence, we can evaluate CF and GF simultaneously. We empirically observe that CF does not imply GF in image classification, whereas studies on tabular datasets observed the opposite. We theoretically show that it can happen when a latent attribute $G$ correlated with, but not caused by, the sensitive attribute (e.g., males usually have shorter hair than females), exists. From this observation, we propose a simple baseline Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CKD) to mitigate the problem. Extensive experimental results on CelebA-CF and LFW-CF demonstrate that CF-achieving models satisfy GF if we successfully reduce the reliance to $G$ (e.g., using CKD). Code and datasets will be publically available upon acceptance.

Does Video-Text Pretraining Help Open-Vocabulary Online Action Detection?
Video understanding relies on accurate action detection for temporal analysis. However, existing mainstream methods have limitations in real-world applications due to their offline and closed-set evaluation approaches, as well as their dependence on manual annotations. To address these challenges and enable real-time action understanding in open-world scenarios, we propose OV-OAD, a zero-shot online action detector that leverages vision-language models and learns solely from text supervision. By introducing an object-centered decoder unit into a Transformer-based model, we aggregate frames with similar semantics using video-text correspondence. Extensive experiments on two action detection benchmarks, THUMOS'14 and TVSeries, demonstrate that OV-OAD outperforms other advanced zero-shot methods, achieving 37.5\% mean average precision and 73.8\% calibrated average precision, respectively. Our work establishes a robust baseline for zero-shot transfer in online action detection, enabling scalable solutions for open-world temporal understanding.

Do Finetti: On Causal Effects for Exchangeable Data
We study causal effect estimation in a setting where the data are not i.i.d.$\ $(independent and identically distributed). We focus on exchangeable data satisfying an assumption of independent causal mechanisms. Traditional causal effect estimation frameworks, e.g., relying on structural causal models and do-calculus, are typically limited to i.i.d. data and do not extend to more general exchangeable generative processes, which naturally arise in multi-environment data. To address this gap, we develop a generalized framework for exchangeable data and introduce a truncated factorization formula that facilitates both the identification and estimation of causal effects in our setting. To illustrate potential applications, we introduce a causal Pólya urn model and demonstrate how intervention propagates effects in exchangeable data settings. Finally, we develop an algorithm that performs simultaneous causal discovery and effect estimation given multi-environment data.

DRACO: A Denoising-Reconstruction Autoencoder for Cryo-EM
Foundation models in computer vision have demonstrated exceptional performance in zero-shot and few-shot tasks by extracting multi-purpose features from large-scale datasets through self-supervised pre-training methods. However, these models often overlook the severe corruption in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images by high-level noises. We introduce DRACO, a Denoising-Reconstruction Autoencoder for CryO-EM, inspired by the Noise2Noise (N2N) approach. By processing cryo-EM movies into odd and even images and treating them as independent noisy observations, we apply a denoising-reconstruction hybrid training scheme. We mask both images to create denoising and reconstruction tasks. For DRACO's pre-training, the quality of the dataset is essential, we hence build a high-quality, diverse dataset from an uncurated public database, including over 270,000 movies or micrographs. After pre-training, DRACO naturally serves as a generalizable cryo-EM image denoiser and a foundation model for various cryo-EM downstream tasks. DRACO demonstrates the best performance in denoising, micrograph curation, and particle picking tasks compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release the code, pre-trained models, and the curated dataset to stimulate further research.

Drago: Primal-Dual Coupled Variance Reduction for Faster Distributionally Robust Optimization
We consider the penalized distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem with a closed, convex uncertainty set, a setting that encompasses learning using $f$-DRO and spectral/$L$-risk minimization. We present Drago, a stochastic primal-dual algorithm which combines cyclic and randomized components with a carefully regularized primal update to achieve dual variance reduction. Owing to its design, Drago enjoys a state-of-the-art linear convergence rate on strongly convex-strongly concave DRO problems witha fine-grained dependency on primal and dual condition numbers. The theoretical results are supported with numerical benchmarks on regression and classification tasks.

DreamClear: High-Capacity Real-World Image Restoration with Privacy-Safe Dataset Curation
Image restoration (IR) in real-world  scenarios presents significant challenges due to the lack of high-capacity models and comprehensive  datasets. To tackle these issues, we present a dual strategy: GenIR, an innovative data curation pipeline, and DreamClear, a cutting-edge Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image restoration model.**GenIR**, our pioneering contribution, is a dual-prompt learning pipeline that overcomes the limitations of existing datasets, which typically comprise only a few thousand images and thus offer limited generalizability for larger models. GenIR streamlines the process into three stages: image-text pair construction, dual-prompt based fine-tuning, and data generation \& filtering. This approach circumvents the laborious data crawling process, ensuring copyright compliance and providing a cost-effective, privacy-safe solution for IR dataset construction. The result is a large-scale dataset of one million high-quality 2K images.Our second contribution, **DreamClear**, is a DiT-based image restoration model. It utilizes the generative priors of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and the robust perceptual capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve photorealistic restorations. To boost the model's adaptability to diverse real-world degradations, we introduce Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM). It employs token-wise degradation priors to dynamically integrate various restoration experts, thereby expanding the range of degradations the model can address.Our exhaustive experiments confirm DreamClear's superior performance, underlining the efficacy of our dual strategy for real-world image restoration.

DreamMesh4D: Video-to-4D Generation with Sparse-Controlled Gaussian-Mesh Hybrid Representation
Recent advancements in 2D/3D generative techniques have facilitated the generation of dynamic 3D objects from monocular videos. Previous methods mainly rely on the implicit neural radiance fields (NeRF) or explicit Gaussian Splatting as the underlying representation, and struggle to achieve satisfactory spatial-temporal consistency and high-quality surface texture. Drawing inspiration from modern 3D animation pipelines, we introduce $\textbf{DreamMesh4D}$, a novel framework that combines mesh representation with sparse-controlled deformation technique to generate high-quality 4D object from a monocular video. To overcome the limitation of classical texture representation, we bind Gaussian splats to the surface of the triangular mesh for differentiable optimization of both the texture and mesh vertices. In particular, DreamMesh4D begins with a coarse mesh provided by a single image based 3D generation method. Sparse points are then uniformly sampled across the surface of the mesh, and are used to build a deformation graph to drive the motion of the 3D object for the sake of computational efficiency and providing additional constraint. For each step, transformations of sparse control points are predicted using a deformation network, and the mesh vertices as well as the bound surface Gaussians are deformed via a geometric skinning algorithm. The skinning algorithm is a hybrid approach combining LBS (linear blending skinning) and DQS (dual-quaternion skinning), mitigating drawbacks associated with both approaches. The static surface Gaussians and mesh vertices as well as the dynamic deformation network are learned via reference view photometric loss, score distillation loss as well as other regularization losses in a two-stage manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prior video-to-4D generation methods in terms of rendering quality and spatial-temporal consistency. Furthermore, our mesh-based representation is compatible with modern geometric pipelines, showcasing its potential in the 3D gaming and film industry.

DreamScene: Layout-Guided 3D Scene Generation
The creation of complex 3D scenes tailored to user specifications has been a tedious and challenging task with traditional 3D modeling tools. Although some pioneering works have achieved automatic text-to-3D generation, they are generally limited to small-scale scenes with restricted control over the shape and texture. We introduce DreamScene, a novel method to generate detailed indoor scenes that adhere to the spatial layout preferences and textual descriptions provided by users. Central to our approach is a projection-based approach to convert 3D semantic layout into multi-view 2D proxy maps. Furthermore, we design a semantic and depth conditioned diffusion model to generate multi-view images, which are used to learn a neural radiance field (NeRF) as the final scene representation. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in complex indoor scene generation with diverse textures and consistent and realistic geometry. We will open-source our code and processed dataset.

DreamSteerer: Enhancing Source Image Conditioned Editability using Personalized Diffusion Models
Recent text-to-image (T2I) personalization methods have shown great premise in teaching a diffusion model user-specified concepts given a few images for reusing the acquired concepts in a novel context. With massive efforts being dedicated to personalized generation, a promising extension is personalized editing, namely to edit an image using personalized concepts, which can provide more precise guidance signal than traditional textual guidance. To address this, one straightforward solution is to incorporate a personalized diffusion model with a text-driven editing framework. However, such solution often shows unsatisfactory editability on the source image. To address this, we propose DreamSteerer, a plug-in method for augmenting existing T2I personalization methods. Specifically, we enhance the source image conditioned editability of a personalized diffusion model via a novel Editability Driven Score Distillation (EDSD) objective. Moreover, we identify a mode trapping issue with EDSD, and propose a mode shifting regularization with spatial feature guided sampling to avoid such issue. We further employ two key modifications on the Delta Denoising Score framework that enable high-fidelity local editing with personalized concepts. Extensive experiments validate that DreamSteerer can significantly improve the editability of several T2I personalization baselines while being computationally efficient.

Drift-Resilient TabPFN: In-Context Learning Distribution Shifts on Tabular Data
While most ML models expect independent and identically distributed data, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios due to distribution shifts, resulting in the degradation of machine learning model performance. Until now, no method has significantly outperformed classical supervised learning, which ignores these shifts, with even smaller gains for tabular data.To address this, we present Drift-Resilient TabPFN, a fresh approach based on In-Context Learning with a Prior-Data Fitted Network that learns the learning algorithm itself: it accepts the entire training dataset as input and makes predictions on the test set in a single forward pass. Specifically, it learns to approximate Bayesian inference on synthetic datasets drawn from a prior that specifies the model's inductive bias. This prior is based on structural causal models (SCM), which gradually shift over time. To model shifts of these causal models, we use a secondary SCM, that specifies changes in the primary model parameters.The resulting Drift-Resilient TabPFN can be applied to unseen datasets, runs in seconds, and needs no hyperparameter tuning.Comprehensive evaluations across 18 synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate large performance improvements over a wide range of baselines, such as XGB, CatBoost, and TabPFN. Compared to the strongest baselines, it improves accuracy from 0.687 to 0.743 and ROC AUC from 0.785 to 0.832 while maintaining stronger calibration. This approach could serve as significant groundwork for further research on out-of-distribution prediction.

DRIP: Unleashing Diffusion Priors for Joint Foreground and Alpha Prediction in Image Matting
Recovering the foreground color and opacity/alpha matte from a single image (i.e., image matting) is a challenging and ill-posed problem where data priors play a critical role in achieving precise results. Traditional methods generally predict the alpha matte and then extract the foreground through post-processing, often failing to produce high-fidelity foreground color. This failure stems from the models' difficulty in learning robust color predictions from limited matting datasets. To address this, we explore the potential of leveraging vision priors embedded in pre-trained latent diffusion models (LDM) for estimating foreground RGBA values in challenging scenarios and rare objects. We introduce Drip, a novel approach for image matting that harnesses the rich prior knowledge of LDM models. Our method incorporates a switcher and a cross-domain attention mechanism to extend the original LDM for joint prediction of the foreground color and opacity. This setup facilitates mutual information exchange and ensures high consistency across both modalities. To mitigate the inherent reconstruction errors of the LDM's VAE decoder, we propose a latent transparency decoder to align the RGBA prediction with the input image, thereby reducing discrepancies. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in foreground and alpha predictions and shows remarkable generalizability across various benchmarks. The code will be made publicly available.

DropEdge not Foolproof: Effective Augmentation Method for Signed Graph Neural Networks
Signed graphs can model friendly or antagonistic relations where edges are annotated with a positive or negative sign. The main downstream task in signed graph analysis is $\textit{link sign prediction}$. Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have been widely used for signed graph representation learning. While significant progress has been made in SGNNs research, two issues (i.e., graph sparsity and unbalanced triangles) persist in the current SGNN models. We aim to alleviate these issues through data augmentation ($\textit{DA}$) techniques which have demonstrated effectiveness in improving the performance of graph neural networks. However, most graph augmentation methods are primarily aimed at graph-level and node-level tasks (e.g., graph classification and node classification) and cannot be directly applied to signed graphs due to the lack of side information (e.g., node features and label information) in available real-world signed graph datasets. Random $\textit{DropEdge} $is one of the few $\textit{DA}$ methods that can be directly used for signed graph data augmentation, but its effectiveness is still unknown. In this paper, we first provide the generalization bound for the SGNN model and demonstrate from both experimental and theoretical perspectives that the random $\textit{DropEdge}$ cannot improve the performance of link sign prediction. Therefore, we propose a novel signed graph augmentation method, $\underline{S}$igned $\underline{G}$raph $\underline{A}$ugmentation framework (SGA). Specifically, SGA first integrates a structure augmentation module to detect candidate edges solely based on network information. Furthermore, SGA incorporates a novel strategy to select beneficial candidates. Finally, SGA introduces a novel data augmentation perspective to enhance the training process of SGNNs. Experiment results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SGA effectively boosts the performance of diverse SGNN models, achieving improvements of up to 32.3\% in F1-micro for SGCN on the Slashdot dataset in the link sign prediction task.

Dual-Diffusion for Binocular 3D Human Pose Estimation
Binocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE), reconstructing a 3D pose from 2D poses of two views, offers practical advantages by combining multiview geometry with the convenience of a monocular setup. However, compared to a multiview setup, the reduction in the number of cameras increases uncertainty in 3D reconstruction. To address this issue, we leverage the diffusion model, which has shown success in monocular 3D HPE by recovering 3D poses from noisy data with high uncertainty. Yet, the uncertainty distribution of initial 3D poses remains unknown. Considering that 3D errors stem from 2D errors within geometric constraints, we recognize that the uncertainties of 3D and 2D are integrated in a binocular configuration, with the initial 2D uncertainty being well-defined. Based on this insight, we propose Dual-Diffusion specifically for Binocular 3D HPE, simultaneously denoising the uncertainties in 2D and 3D, and recovering plausible and accurate results. Additionally, we introduce Z-embedding as an additional condition for denoising and implement baseline-width-related pose normalization to enhance the model flexibility for various baseline settings. This is crucial as 3D error influence factors encompass depth and baseline width. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our Dual-Diffusion in 2D refinement and 3D estimation.

Dual Lagrangian Learning for Conic Optimization
This paper presents Dual Lagrangian Learning (DLL), a principled learning methodology for dual conic optimization proxies.DLL leverages conic duality and the representation power of ML models to provide high-duality, dual-feasible solutions, and therefore valid Lagrangian dual bounds, for linear and nonlinear conic optimization problems.The paper introduces a systematic dual completion procedure, differentiable conic projection layers, and a self-supervised learning framework based on Lagrangian duality.It also provides closed-form dual completion formulae for broad classes of conic problems, which eliminate the need for costly implicit layers.The effectiveness of DLL is demonstrated on linear and nonlinear conic optimization problems.The proposed methodology significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art learning-based method, and achieves 1000x speedups over commercial interior-point solvers with optimality gaps under 0.5\% on average.

Dual-Perspective Activation: Efficient Channel Denoising via Joint Forward-Backward Criterion for Artificial Neural Networks
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have gained widespread applications across various areas in recent years. The ANN design is inspired by the working patterns of the human brain. Connections in biological neural networks are sparse, as they only exist between few neurons. Meanwhile, the sparse representation in ANNs has been shown to possess significant advantages. Activation responses of ANNs are typically expected to promote sparse representations, where key signals get activated while irrelevant/redundant signals are suppressed. It can be observed that samples of each category are only correlated with sparse and specific channels in ANNs. However, existing activation mechanisms often struggle to suppress signals from other irrelevant channels entirely, and these signals have been verified to be detrimental to the network's final decision. To address the issue of channel noise interference in ANNs, a novel end-to-end trainable Dual-Perspective Activation (DPA) mechanism is proposed. DPA efficiently identifies irrelevant channels and applies channel denoising under the guidance of a joint criterion established online from both forward and backward propagation perspectives while preserving activation responses from relevant channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPA successfully denoises channels and facilitates sparser neural representations. Moreover, DPA is parameterless, fast, applicable to various mainstream ANN architectures, and achieves remarkable performance compared to other existing activation counterparts across multiple tasks and domains.

Du-IN: Discrete units-guided mask modeling for decoding speech from Intracranial Neural signals
Invasive brain-computer interfaces have garnered significant attention due to their high performance. The current intracranial stereoElectroEncephaloGraphy (sEEG) foundation models typically build univariate representations based on a single channel. Some of them further use Transformer to model the relationship among channels. However, due to the locality and specificity of brain computation, their performance on more difficult tasks, e.g., speech decoding, which demands intricate processing in specific brain regions, is yet to be fully investigated. We hypothesize that building multi-variate representations within certain brain regions can better capture the specific neural processing. To explore this hypothesis, we collect a well-annotated Chinese word-reading sEEG dataset, targeting language-related brain networks, over 12 subjects. Leveraging this benchmark dataset, we developed the Du-IN model that can extract contextual embeddings from specific brain regions through discrete codebook-guided mask modeling. Our model achieves SOTA performance on the downstream 61-word classification task, surpassing all baseline models. Model comparison and ablation analysis reveal that our design choices, including (i) multi-variate representation by fusing channels in vSMC and STG regions and (ii) self-supervision by discrete codebook-guided mask modeling, significantly contribute to these performances. Collectively, our approach, inspired by neuroscience findings, capitalizing on multi-variate neural representation from specific brain regions, is suitable for invasive brain modeling. It marks a promising neuro-inspired AI approach in BCI.

Dynamic Neural Regeneration: Enhancing Deep Learning Generalization on Small Datasets
The efficacy of deep learning techniques is contingent upon access to large volumes of data (labeled or unlabeled). However, in practical domains such as medical applications, data availability is often limited. This presents a significant challenge: How can we effectively train deep neural networks on relatively small datasets while improving generalization? Recent works have explored evolutionary or iterative training paradigms, which reinitialize a subset of parameters to enhance generalization performance for small datasets. However, these methods typically rely on randomly selected parameter subsets and maintain fixed masks throughout training, potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes. Inspired by neurogenesis in the brain, we propose a novel iterative training framework, Dynamic Neural Regeneration (DNR), that employs a data-aware dynamic masking scheme to eliminate redundant connections by estimating their significance. This approach increases the model's capacity for further learning through random weight reinitialization. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness, highlighting its potential for real-world applications where data collection is challenging.

Dynamic Service Fee Pricing under Strategic Behavior: Actions as Instruments and Phase Transition
We study a dynamic pricing problem for third-party platform service fees under strategic, far-sighted customers. In each time period, the platform sets a service fee based on historical data, observes the resulting transaction quantities, and collects revenue. The platform also monitors equilibrium prices influenced by both demand and supply. The objective is to maximize total revenue over a time horizon $T$. Our problem incorporates three practical challenges: (a) initially, the platform lacks knowledge of the demand side beforehand, necessitating a balance between exploring (learning the demand curve) and exploiting (maximizing revenue) simultaneously; (b) since only equilibrium prices and quantities are observable, traditional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimators would be biased and inconsistent; (c) buyers are rational and strategic, seeking to maximize their consumer surplus and potentially misrepresenting their preferences. To address these challenges, we propose novel algorithmic solutions. Our approach involves: (i) a carefully designed active randomness injection to balance exploration and exploitation effectively; (ii) using non-i.i.d. actions as instrumental variables (IV) to consistently estimate demand; (iii) a low-switching cost design that promotes nearly truthful buyer behavior. We show an expected regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (\sqrt{T}\wedge\sigma_S^{-2})$ and demonstrate its optimality, up to logarithmic factors, with respect to both the time horizon $T$ and the randomness in supply $\sigma_S$. Despite its simplicity, our model offers valuable insights into the use of actions as estimation instruments, the benefits of low-switching pricing policies in mitigating strategic buyer behavior, and the role of supply randomness in facilitating exploration which leads to a phase transition of policy performance.

DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control
Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex visuo-motor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or trained directly through the behavior cloning objective.  In this work, we present DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions. Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of five simulated and real environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly improves downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP, and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best viewed at https://dynamo-anon.github.io.

EAGLE: Efficient Adaptive Geometry-based Learning in Cross-view Understanding
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation has been an efficient approach to transferring the semantic segmentation model across data distributions. Meanwhile, the recent Open-vocabulary Semantic Scene understanding based on large-scale vision language models is effective in open-set settings because it can learn diverse concepts and categories. However, these prior methods fail to generalize across different camera views due to the lack of cross-view geometric modeling. At present, there are limited studies analyzing cross-view learning. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Cross-view Adaptation Learning approach to modeling the geometric structural change across views in Semantic Scene Understanding. First, we introduce a novel Cross-view Geometric Constraint on Unpaired Data to model structural changes in images and segmentation masks across cameras. Second, we present a new Geodesic Flow-based Correlation Metric to efficiently measure the geometric structural changes across camera views. Third, we introduce a novel view-condition prompting mechanism to enhance the view-information modeling of the open-vocabulary segmentation network in cross-view adaptation learning. The experiments on different cross-view adaptation benchmarks have shown the effectiveness of our approach in cross-view modeling, demonstrating that we achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance compared to prior unsupervised domain adaptation and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods.

e-COP : Episodic Constrained Optimization of Policies
In this paper, we present the e-COP algorithm, the first policy optimization algorithm for constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) in episodic (finite horizon) settings. Such formulations are applicable when there are separate sets of optimization criteria and constraints on a system's behavior. We approach this problem by first establishing a policy difference lemma for the episodic setting, which provides the theoretical foundation for the algorithm. Then, we propose to combine a set of established and novel solution ideas to yield the e-COP  algorithm that is easy to implement and numerically stable, and provide a theoretical guarantee on optimality under certain scaling assumptions. Through extensive empirical analysis using benchmarks in the Safety Gym suite, we show that our algorithm has similar or better performance than SoTA (non-episodic) algorithms adapted for the episodic setting. The scalability of the algorithm  opens the door to its application in safety-constrained Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language or Diffusion Models.

Edit Distance Robust Watermarks via Indexing Pseudorandom Codes
Motivated by the problem of detecting AI-generated text, we consider the problem of watermarking the output of language models with provable guarantees. We aim for watermarks which satisfy: (a) undetectability, a cryptographic notion introduced by Christ, Gunn, & Zamir (2023) which stipulates that it is computationally hard to distinguish watermarked language model outputs from the model's actual output distribution; and (b) robustness to channels which introduce a constant fraction of adversarial insertions, substitutions, and deletions to the watermarked text. Earlier schemes could only handle stochastic substitutions and deletions, and thus we are aiming for a more natural and appealing robustness guarantee that holds with respect to edit distance.  Our main result is a watermarking scheme which achieves both (a) and (b) when the alphabet size for the language model is allowed to grow as a polynomial in the security parameter. To derive such a scheme, we follow an approach introduced by Christ & Gunn (2024), which proceeds via first constructing pseudorandom codes satisfying undetectability and robustness properties analogous to those above; our codes have the additional benefit of relying on weaker computational assumptions than used in previous work.   Then we show that there is a generic transformation from such codes over large alphabets to watermarking schemes for arbitrary language models.

EDT: An Efficient Diffusion Transformer Framework Inspired by Human-like Sketching
Transformer-based Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have shown more potential than CNN-based DPMs, yet their extensive computational requirements hinder widespread practical applications.%To reduce the computation budget of transformer-based DPMs, this work proposes the \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{T}ransformer (EDT) framework.%This framework includes a lightweight-design diffusion model architecture, and a training-free Attention Modulation Matrix and its alternation arrangement in EDT inspired by human-like sketching. % Additionally, we propose a token relation-enhanced masking training strategy tailored explicitly for EDT to augment its token relation learning capability. %Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of EDT. %The EDT framework reduces training and inference costs and surpasses existing transformer-based diffusion models in image synthesis performance, thereby achieving a significant overall enhancement.%For instance, our EDT-S has achieved a FID score of 34.27, which is lower than 39.5 in MDTv2-S. And EDT-S has 3.93 $\times$ faster training speed and 2.29 $\times$ faster inference speed compared to MDTv2-S.

EEGPT: Pretrained Transformer for Universal and Reliable Representation of EEG Signals
Electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for recording brain activity,   with applications in medicine, neuroscience, and brain-computer interfaces (BCI).   However, challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), high inter-subject variability, and channel mismatch complicate the extraction of robust,   universal EEG representations.   We propose EEGPT, a novel 10-million-parameter pretrained transformer model designed for universal EEG feature extraction.   In EEGPT, a mask-based dual self-supervised learning method for efficient feature extraction is designed.   Compared to other mask-based self-supervised learning methods,   EEGPT introduces spatio-temporal representation alignment.   This involves constructing a self-supervised task based on   EEG representations that possess high SNR and rich semantic information,   rather than on raw signals.   Consequently, this approach mitigates the issue of poor feature quality typically   extracted from low SNR signals.  Additionally, EEGPT's hierarchical structure processes spatial and temporal information separately,   reducing computational complexity while increasing flexibility and adaptability for BCI applications.   By training on a large mixed multi-task EEG dataset, we fully exploit EEGPT's capabilities.  The experiment validates the efficacy and scalability of EEGPT,   achieving state-of-the-art performance on a range of downstream tasks with linear-probing.  Our research advances EEG representation learning, offering innovative solutions for bio-signal processing and AI applications.  Our code will be available.

Effective Sharpness Aware Minimization Requires Layerwise Perturbation Scaling
Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) enhances performance across various neural architectures and datasets. As models are continually scaled up to improve performance, a rigorous understanding of SAM's scaling behavior is paramount. To this end, we study the infinite-width limit of neural networks trained with SAM, using the Tensor Programs framework. Our findings reveal that the dynamics of standard SAM effectively reduce to applying SAM solely in the last layer in wide neural networks, even with optimal hyperparameters. In contrast, we identify a unique parameterization with layerwise perturbation scaling, which we call maximal update and perturbation parameterization ($\mu$P$^2$), that ensures all layers are both feature learning and effectively perturbed in the limit. Through experiments with MLPs, ResNets and Vision Transformers, we empirically demonstrate that $\mu$P$^2$ is the only parameterization to achieve hyperparameter transfer of the joint optimum of learning rate and perturbation radius across model scales. Moreover, we provide an intuitive condition to derive $\mu$P$^2$ for other perturbation rules like Adaptive SAM and SAM-ON, also ensuring balanced perturbation effects across all layers.

Efficiency for Free: Ideal Data Are Transportable Representations
Data, the seminal opportunity and challenge in modern machine learning, currently constrains the scalability of representation learning and impedes the pace of model evolution.Existing paradigms tackle the issue of learning efficiency over massive datasets from the perspective of self-supervised learning and dataset distillation independently, while neglecting the untapped potential of accelerating representation learning from an intermediate standpoint.In this work, we delve into defining the ideal data properties from both optimization and generalization perspectives, where model-generated representations can be effectively transported to others through ideal data.The theoretical/empirical insights therein inspire us to propose a Representation Learning Accelerator (ReLA), which leverages a task- and architecture-agnostic, yet publicly available, free model to form a dynamic data subset and thus accelerate (self-)supervised learning.For instance, employing a CLIP ViT B/16 as a prior model for dynamic data generation, ReLA-aided BYOL can train a ResNet-50 from scratch with 50% of ImageNet-1K, yielding performance surpassing that of training on the full dataset.Additionally, employing a ResNet-18 pre-trained on CIFAR-10 can enhance ResNet-50 training on 10% of ImageNet-1K, resulting in a 7.7% increase in accuracy.

Efficient $\Phi$-Regret Minimization with Low-Degree Swap Deviations in Extensive-Form Games
Recent breakthrough results by Dagan, Daskalakis, Fishelson and Golowich [2023] and Peng and Rubinstein [2023] established an efficient algorithm attaining at most $\epsilon$ swap regret over extensive-form strategy spaces of dimension $N$ in $N^{\tilde O(1/\epsilon)}$ rounds. On the other extreme, Farina and Pipis [2023] developed an efficient algorithm for minimizing the weaker notion of linear-swap regret in $\mathsf{poly}(N)/\epsilon^2$ rounds. In this paper, we take a step toward bridging the gap between those two results. We introduce the set of $k$-mediator deviations, which generalize the untimed communication deviations recently introduced by Zhang, Farina and Sandholm [2024] to the case of having multiple mediators, and we develop parameterized algorithms for minimizing the regret with respect to this set of deviations in $N^{O(k)}/\epsilon^2$ rounds. Moreover, by relating $k$-mediator deviations to low-degree polynomials, we show that regret minimization against degree-$k$ polynomial swap deviations is achievable in $N^{O(kd)^3}/\epsilon^2$ rounds, where $d$ is the depth of the game, assuming a constant branching factor. For a fixed degree $k$, this is polynomial for Bayesian games and quasipolynomial more broadly when $d = \mathsf{polylog} N$---the usual balancedness assumption on the game tree. The first key ingredient in our approach is a relaxation of the usual notion of a fixed point required in the framework of Gordon, Greenwald and Marks [2008]. Namely, for a given deviation $\phi$, we show that it suffices to compute what we refer to as a \emph{fixed point in expectation}; that is, a distribution $\pi$ such that $\mathbb{E}_{x \sim \pi} [\phi(x) - x] \approx 0$. Unlike the problem of computing an actual (approximate) fixed point $x \approx \phi(x)$, which we show is PPAD-hard, there is a simple and efficient algorithm for finding a solution that satisfies our relaxed notion. As a byproduct, we provide, to our knowledge, the fastest algorithm for computing $\epsilon$-correlated equilibria in normal-form games in the medium-precision regime, obviating the need to solve a linear system in every round. Our second main contribution is a characterization of the set of low-degree deviations, made possible through a connection to low-depth decisions trees from Boolean analysis.

Efficient Algorithm and Improved Regret for RL with Multinomial Logit Function Approximation
We study a new class of MDPs that employs multinomial logit (MNL) function approximation (FA) to ensure valid probability distributions over the state space. Despite its benefits, introducing non-linear FA raises significant challenges in both *computational* and *statistical* efficiency. The best-known method has achieved an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa^{-1}dH^2\sqrt{K})$ regret, where $\kappa$ is a problem-dependent quantity, $d$ is the feature space dimension, $H$ is the episode length, and $K$ is the number of episodes. While this result attains the same rate in $K$ as the linear cases, the method requires storing all historical data and suffers from an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ computation cost per episode. Moreover, the quantity $\kappa$ can be exponentially small, leading to a significant gap for the regret compared to the linear cases. In this work, we first address the computational concerns by proposing an online algorithm that achieves the same regret with only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ computation cost. Then, we design two algorithms that leverage local information to enhance statistical efficiency. They not only maintain an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ computation cost per episode but achieve improved regrets of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa^{-1/2}dH^2\sqrt{K})$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(dH^2\sqrt{K} + d^2H^2\kappa^{-1})$ respectively. Finally, we establish a lower bound, justifying the optimality of our results in $d$ and $K$. To our knowledge, this is the **first** work that achieves almost the **same** *computational* and *statistical* efficiency as linear FA while employing non-linear FA for MDPs.

Efficient and Private Marginal Reconstruction with Local Non-Negativity
Differential privacy is the dominant standard for formal and quantifiable privacy and has been used in major deployments that impact millions of people. Many differentially private algorithms for query release and synthetic data contain steps that reconstruct answers to queries from answers to other queries measured by the mechanism.  Reconstruction is an important subproblem for such mechanisms to economize the privacy budget, minimize error on reconstructed answers, and allow for scalability to high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we introduce a principled and efficient postprocessing method ReM (Residuals-to-Marginals) for reconstructing answers to marginal queries under Gaussian noise. Our method builds on recent work on efficient mechanisms for marginal query release, based on making measurements using a residual query basis that admits efficient pseudoinversion, which is an important primitive used in reconstruction. An extension ReM-LNN (Residuals-to-Marginals with Local Non-negativity) reconstructs marginals satisfying non-negativity and consistency which often reduces error on reconstructed answers.  We demonstrate the utility of ReM and ReM-LNN by applying them to improve existing private query answering mechanisms: ResidualPlanner and MWEM.

Efficient and Sharp Off-Policy Evaluation in Robust Markov Decision Processes
We study evaluating a policy under best- and worst-case perturbations to a Markov decision process (MDP), given transition observations from the original MDP, whether under the same or different policy.  This is an important problem when there is the possibility of a shift between historical and future environments, due to \emph{e.g.} unmeasured confounding, distributional shift, or an adversarial environment.  We propose a perturbation model that can modify transition kernel densities up to a given multiplicative factor or its reciprocal, which extends the classic marginal sensitivity model (MSM) for single time step decision making to infinite-horizon RL.  We characterize the sharp bounds on policy value under this model, that is, the tightest possible bounds given by the transition observations from the original MDP, and we study the estimation of these bounds from such transition observations. We develop an estimator with several appealing guarantees: it is semiparametrically efficient, and remains so even when certain necessary nuisance functions such as worst-case Q-functions are estimated at slow nonparametric rates. It is also asymptotically normal, enabling easy statistical inference using Wald confidence intervals. In addition, when certain nuisances are estimated inconsistently we still estimate valid, albeit possibly not sharp bounds on the policy value. We validate these properties in numerical simulations. The combination of accounting for environment shifts from train to test (robustness), being insensitive to nuisance-function estimation (orthogonality), and accounting for having only finite samples to learn from (inference) together leads to credible and reliable policy evaluation.

Efficient Availability Attacks against Supervised and Contrastive Learning Simultaneously
Availability attacks provide a tool to prevent the unauthorized use of private data and commercial datasets by generating imperceptible noise and crafting unlearnable examples before release. Ideally, the obtained unlearnability can prevent algorithms from training usable models. When supervised learning (SL) algorithms have failed, a malicious data collector possibly resorts to contrastive learning (CL) algorithms to bypass the protection.Through evaluation, we have found that most existing methods are unable to achieve both supervised and contrastive unlearnability, which poses risks to data protection by availability attacks.Different from recent methods based on contrastive learning, we employ contrastive-like data augmentations in supervised learning frameworks to obtain attacks effective for both SL and CL.Our proposed AUE and AAP attacks achieve state-of-the-art worst-case unlearnability across SL and CL algorithms with less computation consumption, showcasing prospects in real-world applications.

EfficientCAPER: An End-to-End Framework for Fast and Robust Category-Level Articulated Object Pose Estimation
Human life is populated with articulated objects. Pose estimation for category-level articulated objects is a significant challenge due to their inherent complexity and diverse kinematic structures. Current methods for this task usually meet the problems of insufficient consideration of kinematic constraints, self-occlusion, and optimization requirements. In this paper, we propose EfficientCAPER, an end-to-end Category-level Articulated object Pose EstimatoR, eliminating the need for optimization functions as post-processing and utilizing the kinematic structure for joint-centric pose modeling, thus enhancing the efficiency and applicability. Given a partial point cloud as input, the EfficientCAPER firstly estimates the pose for the free part of an articulated object using decoupled rotation representation. Next, we canonicalize the input point cloud to estimate constrained parts' poses by predicting the joint parameters and states as replacements. Evaluations on three diverse datasets, ArtImage, ReArtMix, and RobotArm, show EfficientCAPER's effectiveness and generalization ability to real-world scenarios. The framework exhibits excellent static pose estimation performance for articulated objects, contributing to the advancement of category-level pose estimation. Codes will be made publicly available.

Efficient Centroid-Linkage Clustering
We give an efficient algorithm for Centroid-Linkage Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), which computes a $c$-approximate clustering in roughly $n^{1+O(1/c^2)}$ time. We obtain our result by combining a new centroid-linkage HAC algorithm with a novel fully dynamic data structure for nearest neighbor search which works under adaptive updates.We also evaluate our algorithm empirically. By leveraging a state-of-the-art nearest-neighbor search library, we obtain a fast and accurate centroid-linkage HAC algorithm. Compared to an existing state-of-the-art exact baseline, our implementation maintains the clustering quality while delivering up to a $36\times$ speedup due to performing fewer distance comparisons.

Efficient Combinatorial Optimization via Heat Diffusion
Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature. The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal. To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver's search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems.  The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization.

Efficient Discrepancy Testing for Learning with Distribution Shift
A fundamental notion of distance between train and test distributions from the field of domain adaptation is discrepancy distance. While in general hard to compute, here we provide the first set of provably efficient algorithms for testing *localized* discrepancy distance, where discrepancy is computed with respect to a fixed output classifier.  These results imply a broad set of new, efficient learning algorithms in the recently introduced model of Testable Learning with Distribution Shift (TDS learning) due to Klivans et al. (2023).Our approach generalizes and improves all prior work on TDS learning: (1) we obtain *universal* learners that succeed simultaneously for large classes of test distributions, (2) achieve near-optimal error rates, and (3) give exponential improvements for constant depth circuits. Our methods further extend to semi-parametric settings and imply the first positive results for low-dimensional convex sets. Additionally, we separate learning and testing phases and obtain algorithms that run in fully polynomial time at test time.

Efficient Graph Matching for Correlated Stochastic Block Models
We study learning problems on correlated stochastic block models with two balanced communities. Our main result gives the first efficient algorithm for graph matching in this setting. In the most interesting regime where the average degree is logarithmic in the number of vertices, this algorithm correctly matches all but a vanishing fraction of vertices with high probability, whenever the edge correlation parameter $s$ satisfies $s^2 > \alpha \approx 0.338$, where $\alpha$ is Otter's tree-counting constant. Moreover, we extend this to an efficient algorithm for exact graph matching whenever this is information-theoretically possible, positively resolving an open problem of Rácz and Sridhar (NeurIPS 2021). Our algorithm generalizes the recent breakthrough work of Mao, Wu, Xu, and Yu (STOC 2023), which is based on centered subgraph counts of a large family of trees termed chandeliers. A major technical challenge that we overcome is dealing with the additional estimation errors that are necessarily present due to the fact that, in relevant parameter regimes, the latent community partition cannot be exactly recovered from a single graph. As an application of our results, we give an efficient algorithm for exact community recovery using multiple correlated graphs in parameter regimes where it is information-theoretically impossible to do so using just a single graph.

Efficient Lifelong Model Evaluation in an Era of Rapid Progress
Standardized benchmarks drive progress in machine learning. However, with repeated testing, the risk of overfitting grows as algorithms over-exploit benchmark idiosyncrasies. In our work, we seek to mitigate this challenge by compiling \textit{ever-expanding} large-scale benchmarks called \textit{Lifelong Benchmarks}. As exemplars of our approach, we create \textit{Lifelong-CIFAR10} and \textit{Lifelong-ImageNet}, containing (for now) 1.69M and 1.98M test samples, respectively. While reducing overfitting, lifelong benchmarks introduce a key challenge: the high cost of evaluating a growing number of models across an ever-expanding sample set. To address this challenge, we also introduce an efficient evaluation framework: \textit{Sort \& Search (S\&S)}, which reuses previously evaluated models by leveraging dynamic programming algorithms to selectively rank and sub-select test samples, enabling cost-effective lifelong benchmarking. Extensive empirical evaluations across $\sim$31,000 models demonstrate that \textit{S\&S} achieves highly-efficient approximate accuracy measurement, reducing compute cost from 180 GPU days to 5 GPU hours ($\sim$1000x reduction) on a single A100 GPU, with low approximation error. As such, lifelong benchmarks offer a robust, practical solution to the ``benchmark exhaustion'' problem.

Efficiently Learning Significant Fourier Feature Pairs for Statistical Independence Testing
We propose a novel method to efficiently learn significant Fourier feature pairs for maximizing the power of Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion~(HSIC) based independence tests. We first reinterpret HSIC in the frequency domain, which reveals its limited discriminative power due to the inability to adapt to specific frequency-domain features under the current inflexible configuration. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce a module of learnable Fourier features, thereby developing a new criterion. We then derive a finite sample estimate of the test power by modeling the behavior of the criterion, thus formulating an optimization objective for significant Fourier feature pairs learning. We show that this optimization objective can be computed in linear time (with respect to the sample size $n$), which ensures fast independence tests. We also prove the convergence property of the optimization objective and establish the consistency of the independence tests. Extensive empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets validates our method's superiority in effectiveness and efficiency, particularly in handling high-dimensional data and dealing with large-scale scenarios.

Efficient Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding using Low-Rank Matrix Completion Algorithms
Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding is a powerful decoding strategy widely used for text generation tasks but its quadratic computational complexity limits its practical application. This paper presents a novel approach for approximating MBR decoding using matrix completion techniques, focusing on a machine translation task. We formulate MBR decoding as a matrix completion problem, where the utility metric scores between candidate hypotheses and reference translations form a low-rank matrix. First we empirically show that the scores matrices indeed have a low-rank structure. Then we exploit this by only computing a random subset of the scores and efficiently recover the missing entries in the matrix by applying the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm, thereby enabling fast approximation of the MBR decoding process. Our experimental results on machine translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed method requires 1/16 utility metric computations compared to the vanilla MBR decoding while achieving equal translation quality measured by COMET on the WMT22 dataset (en<>de, en<>ru). We also benchmark our method against other approximation methods and we show significant gains in quality.

Efficient multi-prompt evaluation of LLMs
Most popular benchmarks for comparing LLMs rely on a limited set of prompt templates, which may not fully capture the LLMs’ abilities and can affect the reproducibility of results on leaderboards. Many recent works empirically verify prompt sensitivity and advocate for changes in LLM evaluation. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the performance distribution across many prompt variants instead of finding a single prompt to evaluate with. We introduce PromptEval, a method for estimating performance across a large set of prompts borrowing strength across prompts and examples to produce accurate estimates under practical evaluation budgets. The resulting distribution can be used to obtain performance quantiles to construct various robust performance metrics (e.g., top 95% quantile or median). We prove that PromptEval consistently estimates the performance distribution and demonstrate its efficacy empirically on three prominent LLM benchmarks: MMLU, BIG-bench Hard, and LMentry. For example, PromptEval can accurately estimate performance quantiles across 100 prompt templates on MMLU with a budget equivalent to two single-prompt evaluations.

Efficient Policy Evaluation Across Multiple Different Experimental Datasets
Artificial intelligence systems are trained combining various observational and experimental datasets from different source sites, and are increasingly used to reason about the effectiveness of candidate policies. One common assumption in this context is that the data in source and target sites (where the candidate policy is due to be deployed) come from the same distribution. This assumption is often violated in practice, causing challenges for generalization, transportability, or external validity. Despite recent advances for determining the identifiability of the effectiveness of policies in a target domain, there are still challenges for the accurate estimation of effects from finite samples. In this paper, we develop novel graphical criteria and estimators for evaluating the effectiveness of policies (e.g., conditional, stochastic) by combining data from multiple experimental studies. Asymptotic error analysis of our estimators provides fast convergence guarantee. We empirically verified the robustness of estimators through simulations.

Efficient Recurrent Off-Policy RL Requires a Context-Encoder-Specific Learning Rate
Real-world decision-making tasks are usually partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), where the state is not fully observable. Recent progress has demonstrated that recurrent reinforcement learning (RL), which consists of a context encoder based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for unobservable state prediction and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy for decision making, can mitigate partial observability and serve as a robust baseline for POMDP tasks. However, previous recurrent RL methods face training stability issues due to the gradient instability of RNNs. In this paper, we propose **R**ecurrent Off-policy RL with Context-**E**ncoder-**S**p**e**cific **L**earning Rate (RESeL) to tackle this issue. Specifically, RESeL uses a lower learning rate for context encoder than other MLP layers to ensure the stability of the former while maintaining the training efficiency of the latter. We integrate this technique into existing off-policy RL methods, resulting in the RESeL algorithm. We evaluated RESeL in 18 POMDP tasks, including classic, meta-RL, and credit assignment scenarios, as well as five MDP locomotion tasks. The experiments demonstrate significant improvements in training stability with RESeL. Comparative results show that RESeL achieves notable performance improvements over previous recurrent RL baselines in POMDP tasks, and is competitive with or even surpasses state-of-the-art methods in MDP tasks. Further ablation studies highlight the necessity of applying a distinct learning rate for the context encoder.

Efficient Streaming Algorithms for Graphlet Sampling
Given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, the Graphlet Sampling problem asks to sample a connected induced $k$-vertex subgraph of $G$ uniformly at random. A recent work has shown that the problem admits an algorithm that preprocesses $G$ in time $O(nk^2 \log k + m)$, and draws one sample in expected time $k^{O(k)} \log n$, where $n=|V(G)|$ and $m=|E(G)|$. Such an algorithm relies on the assumption that the input graph fits into main memory and it does not seem to be straightforward to adapt it to very large graphs. We consider Graphlet Sampling in the semi-streaming setting, where we have a memory of $M = \Omega(n \log n)$ words, and $G$ can be only read through sequential passes over the edge list. We develop a semi-streaming algorithm that preprocesses $G$ in $p={O}(\log n)$ passes and samples $\Theta(M k^{-O(k)})$ independent uniform $k$-graphlets in $O(k)$ passes. For constant $k$, both phases run in time $O((n+m)\log n)$. We also show that the tradeoff between memory and number of passes of our algorithms is near-optimal. Our extensive evaluation on very large graphs shows the effectiveness of our algorithms.

EGODE: An Event-attended Graph ODE Framework for Modeling Rigid Dynamics
This paper studies the problem of rigid dynamics modeling, which has a wide range of applications in robotics, graphics, and mechanical design. The problem is partly solved by graph neural network (GNN) simulators. However, these approaches cannot effectively handle the relationship between intrinsic continuity and instantaneous changes in rigid dynamics. Moreover, they usually neglect hierarchical structures across mesh nodes and objects in systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Event-attend Graph ODE(EGODE) for effective rigid dynamics modeling. In particular, we describe the rigid system using both mesh node representations and object representations. To model continuous dynamics across hierarchical structures, we use a coupled graph ODE framework for the evolution of both types of representations over a long period. In addition, to capture instantaneous changes during the collision, we introduce an event module, which can effectively estimate the occurrence of the collision and update the states of both mesh node and object representations during evolution. Extensive experiments on a range of benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed EGODE compared to various state-of-the-art baselines. The source code can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EGODE-12E3.

EGonc : Energy-based Open-Set Node Classification with substitute Unknowns
Open-set Classification (OSC) is a critical requirement for safely deploying machine learning models in the open world, which aims to classify samples from known classes and reject samples from out-of-distribution (OOD). Existing methods exploit the feature space of trained network and attempt at estimating the uncertainty in the predictions.However, softmax-based neural networks are found to be overly confident in their predictions even on data they have never seen before andthe immense diversity of the OOD examples also makes such methods fragile.To this end, we follow the idea of estimating the underlying density of the training data to decide whether a given input is close to the in-distribution (IND) data and adopt Energy-based models (EBMs) as density estimators. A novel energy-based generative open-set node classification method, \textit{EGonc}, is proposed to achieve open-set graph learning. Specifically, we generate substitute unknowns to mimic the distribution of real open-set samples firstly, based on the information of graph structures. Then, an additional energy logit representing the virtual OOD class is learned from the residual of the feature against the principal space, and matched with the original logits by a constant scaling. This virtual logit serves as the indicator of OOD-ness. EGonc has nice theoretical properties that guarantee an overall distinguishable margin between the detection scores for IND and OOD samples. Comprehensive experimental evaluations of EGonc also demonstrate its superiority.

EGSST: Event-based Graph Spatiotemporal Sensitive Transformer for Object Detection
Event cameras provide exceptionally high temporal resolution in dynamic vision systems due to their unique event-driven mechanism. However, the sparse and asynchronous nature of event camera data makes frame-based visual processing methods inappropriate. This study proposes a novel framework, Event-based Graph Spatiotemporal Sensitive Transformer (EGSST), for the exploitation of spatial and temporal properties of event data. Firstly, a well-designed graph structure is employed to model event data, which not only preserves the original temporal data but also captures spatial details. Furthermore, inspired by the phenomenon that human eyes pay more attention to objects that produce significant dynamic changes, we design a Spatiotemporal Sensitivity Module (SSM) and an adaptive Temporal Activation Controller (TAC). Through these two modules, our framework can mimic the response of the human eyes in dynamic environments by selectively activating the temporal attention mechanism based on the relative dynamics of event data, thereby effectively conserving computational resources. In addition, the integration of a lightweight, multi-scale Linear Vision Transformer (LViT) markedly enhances processing efficiency. Our research proposes a fully event-driven approach, effectively exploiting the temporal precision of event data and optimising the allocation of computational resources by intelligently distinguishing the dynamics within the event data. The framework provides a lightweight, fast, accurate, and fully event-based solution for object detection tasks in complex dynamic environments, demonstrating significant practicality and potential for application.

EigenVI: score-based variational inference with orthogonal function expansions
We develop EigenVI, a new approach for black-box variational inference (BBVI). EigenVI fits a novel class variational approximations based on orthogonal function expansions. For distributions over $\mathbb{R}^D$, the lowest order term in these expansions provides a Gaussian variational approximation, while higher-order terms provide a systematic way to model non-Gaussianity. These variational approximations are flexible enough to model complex distributions (multimodal, asymmetric), but they are simple enough that one can calculate their low-order moments and draw samples from them. Further, by choosing different families of orthogonal functions, EigenVI can model different types of random variables (e.g., real-valued, nonnegative, bounded). To fit the approximation, EigenVI matches score functions by minimizing a Fisher divergence. Notably, this optimization reduces to solving a minimum eigenvalue problem, so that EigenVI effectively sidesteps the iterative gradient-based optimizations that are required for many other BBVI algorithms.  (Gradient-based methods can be sensitive to learning rates, termination criteria, and other tunable hyperparameters.) We study EigenVI on a variety of target distributions, including a benchmark suite of Bayesian models from posteriordb. Compared to existing methods for BBVI, EigenVI is more accurate.

einspace: Searching for Neural Architectures from Fundamental Operations
Neural architecture search (NAS) finds high performing networks for a given task. Yet the results of NAS are fairly prosaic; they did not e.g. create a shift from convolutional structures to transformers. This is not least because the search spaces in NAS often aren't diverse enough to include such transformations _a priori_. Instead, for NAS to provide greater potential for fundamental design shifts, we need a novel expressive search space design which is built from more fundamental operations. To this end, we introduce einspace, a search space based on a parameterised probabilistic context-free grammar (CFG). Our space is versatile, supporting architectures of various sizes and complexities, while also containing diverse network operations which allow it to model convolutions, attention components and more. It contains many existing competitive architectures, and provides flexibility for discovering new ones. Using this search space, we perform experiments to find novel architectures as well as improvements on existing ones on the diverse Unseen NAS datasets. We show that competitive architectures can be obtained by searching from scratch, and we consistently find large improvements when initialising the search with strong baselines. We believe that this work is an important advancement towards a transformative NAS paradigm where search space expressivity and strategic search initialisation play key roles.

Einsum Benchmark: Enabling the Development of Next-Generation Tensor Execution Engines
Modern artificial intelligence and machine learning workflows rely on efficient tensor libraries. However, tuning tensor libraries without considering the actual problems they are meant to execute can lead to a mismatch between expected performance and the actual performance. Einsum libraries are tuned to efficiently execute tensor expressions with only a few, relatively large, dense, floating-point tensors. But, practical applications of einsum cover a much broader range of tensor expressions than those that can currently be executed efficiently. For this reason, we have created a benchmark dataset that encompasses this broad range of tensor expressions, allowing future implementations of einsum to build upon and be evaluated against. In addition, we also provide generators for einsum expression and converters to einsum expressions in our repository, so that additional data can be generated as needed. The benchmark dataset, the generators and converters are released openly and are publicly available at https://benchmark.einsum.org.

ElasTST: Towards Robust Varied-Horizon Forecasting with Elastic Time-Series Transformer
Numerous industrial sectors necessitate models capable of providing robust forecasts across various horizons. Despite the recent strides in crafting specific architectures for time-series forecasting and developing pre-trained universal models, a comprehensive examination of their capability in accommodating varied-horizon forecasting during inference is still lacking. This paper bridges this gap through the design and evaluation of the Elastic Time-Series Transformer (ElasTST). The ElasTST model incorporates a non-autoregressive design with placeholders and structured self-attention masks, warranting future outputs that are invariant to adjustments in inference horizons. A tunable version of rotary position embedding is also integrated into ElasTST to capture time-series-specific periods and enhance adaptability to different horizons. Additionally, ElasTST employs a multi-scale patch design, effectively integrating both fine-grained and coarse-grained information. Through comprehensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art time-series architectures and contemporary foundation models, we demonstrate the efficacy of ElasTST's unique design elements. Our findings position ElasTST as a robust solution for the practical necessity of varied-horizon forecasting.

Elliptical Attention
Pairwise dot-product self-attention is key to the success of transformers that achieve state-of-the-art performance across a variety of applications in language and vision. This dot-product self-attention computes attention weights among the input tokens using Euclidean distance, which makes the model prone to representation collapse and vulnerable to contaminated samples. In this paper, we propose using a Mahalanobis distance metric for computing the attention weights to stretch the underlying feature space in directions of high contextual relevance. In particular, we define a hyper-ellipsoidal neighborhood around each query to increase the attention weights of the tokens lying in the contextually important directions. We term this novel class of attention Elliptical Attention. Our Elliptical Attention provides two benefits: 1) reducing representation collapse and 2) enhancing the model's robustness as the Elliptical Attention pays more attention to contextually relevant information, rather than focusing on some small subset of informative features. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of Elliptical Attention over the baseline dot-product attention and state-of-the-art attention methods on various practical tasks, including object classification, imagesegmentation, and language modeling across different data modalities.

ELSA: Exploiting Layer-wise N:M Sparsity for Vision Transformer Acceleration
$N{:}M$ sparsity is an emerging model compression method supported by more and more accelerators to speed up sparse matrix multiplication in deep neural networks. Most existing $N{:}M$ sparsity methods compress neural networks with a uniform setting for all layers in a network or heuristically determine the layer-wise configuration by considering the number of parameters in each layer. However, very few methods have been designed for obtaining a layer-wise customized $N{:}M$ sparse configuration for vision transformers (ViTs), which usually consist of transformer blocks involving the same number of parameters. In this work, to address the challenge of selecting suitable sparse configuration for ViTs on $N{:}M$ sparsity-supporting accelerators, we propose ELSA, Exploiting Layer-wise $N{:}M$ Sparsity for ViTs. Considering not only all $N{:}M$ sparsity levels supported by a given accelerator but also the expected throughput improvement, our methodology can reap the benefits of accelerators supporting mixed sparsity by trading off negligible accuracy loss with both memory usage and inference time reduction for ViT models.For instance, our approach achieves a noteworthy 2.9$\times$ reduction in FLOPs for both Swin-B and DeiT-B with only a marginal degradation of accuracy on ImageNet. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Elucidating the Design Space of Dataset Condensation
Dataset condensation, a concept within data-centric learning, efficiently transfers critical attributes from an original dataset to a synthetic version, maintaining both diversity and realism. This approach significantly improves model training efficiency and is adaptable across multiple application areas. Previous methods in dataset condensation have faced challenges: some incur high computational costs which limit scalability to larger datasets (e.g., MTT, DREAM, and TESLA), while others are restricted to less optimal design spaces, which could hinder potential improvements, especially in smaller datasets (e.g., SRe$^2$L, G-VBSM, and RDED). To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive design framework that includes specific, effective strategies like implementing soft category-aware matching and adjusting the learning rate schedule. These strategies are grounded in empirical evidence and theoretical backing. Our resulting approach, Elucidate Dataset Condensation (EDC), establishes a benchmark for both small and large-scale dataset condensation. In our testing, EDC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reaching 48.6% on ImageNet-1k with a ResNet-18 model at an IPC of 10, which corresponds to a compression ratio of 0.78%. This performance exceeds those of SRe$^2$L, G-VBSM, and RDED by margins of 27.3%, 17.2%, and 6.6%, respectively.

Embedding Dimension of Contrastive Learning and $k$-Nearest Neighbors
We study the embedding dimension of distance comparison data in two settings: contrastive learning and $k$-nearest neighbors ($k$-NN). In both cases, the goal is to find the smallest dimension $d$ of an $\ell_p$-space in which a given dataset can be represented. We show that the arboricity of the associated graphs plays a key role in designing embeddings. Using this approach, for the most frequently used $\ell_2$-distance, we get matching upper and lower bounds in both settings.    In contrastive learning, we are given $m$ labeled samples of the form $(x_i, y_i^+, z_i^-)$ representing the fact that the positive example $y_i$ is closer to the anchor $x_i$ than the negative example $z_i$. We show that for representing such dataset in:- $\ell_2$: $d = \Theta(\sqrt{m})$ is necessary and sufficient.- $\ell_p$ for $p \ge 1$: $d = O(m)$ is sufficient and $d = \tilde \Omega(\sqrt{m})$ is necessary.- $\ell_\infty$: $d = O(m^{2/3})$ is sufficient and $d = \tilde \Omega(\sqrt{m})$ is necessary.We also give results for the more general scenario when $t$ negatives are allowed.In $k$-NN, for each of the $n$ data points we are given an ordered set of the closest $k$ points. We show that for preserving the ordering of the $k$-NN for every point in:- $\ell_2$: $d = \Theta(k)$ is necessary and sufficient.- $\ell_p$ for $p \ge 1$: $d = \tilde O(k^2)$ is sufficient and $d=\tilde \Omega(k)$ is necessary.- $\ell_\infty$ : $d = \tilde \Omega(k)$ is necessary.Furthermore, if the goal is to not just preserve the ordering of the $k$-NN but also keep them as the nearest neighbors then $d = \tilde O (\mathrm{poly}(k))$ suffices in $\ell_p$ for $p \ge 1$.

EM Distillation for One-step Diffusion Models
While diffusion models  can learn complex distributions, sampling requires a computationally expensive iterative process.  Existing distillation methods enable efficient sampling, but have notable limitations, such as performance degradation with very few sampling steps, reliance on training data access, or mode-seeking optimization that may fail to capture the full distribution. We propose EM Distillation (EMD), a maximum likelihood-based approach that distills a diffusion model to a one-step generator model with minimal loss of perceptual quality. Our approach is derived through the lens of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the generator parameters are updated using samples from the joint distribution of the diffusion teacher prior and inferred generator latents. We develop a reparametrized sampling scheme and a noise cancellation technique that together stabilizes the distillation process. We further reveal an interesting connection of our method with existing methods that minimize mode-seeking KL. EMD outperforms existing one-step generative methods in terms of FID scores on ImageNet-64 and ImageNet-128, and compares favorably with prior work on distilling text-to-image diffusion models.

Emergence of heavy tails in homogenized stochastic gradient descent
It has repeatedly been observed that loss minimization by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) leads to heavy-tailed distributions of neural network parameters. Here, we analyze a continuous diffusion approximation of SGD, called homogenized stochastic gradient descent, and show in a regularized regression framework that it leads to an asymptotically heavy-tailed parameter distribution, even though local gradient noise is Gaussian. We give explicit upper and lower bounds on the tail-index of the resulting parameter distribution and validate these bounds in numerical experiments. Moreover, the explicit form of these bounds enables us to quantify the interplay between optimization hyperparameters and the tail-index. Doing so, we contribute to the ongoing discussion on links between heavy tails and the generalization performance of neural networks as well as the ability of SGD to avoid suboptimal local minima.

emg2qwerty: A Large Dataset with Baselines for Touch Typing using Surface Electromyography
Surface electromyography (sEMG) non-invasively measures signals generated by muscle activity with sufficient sensitivity to detect individual spinal neurons and richness to identify dozens of gestures and their nuances. Wearable wrist-based sEMG sensors have the potential to offer low friction, subtle, information rich, always available human-computer inputs. To this end, we introduce emg2qwerty, a large-scale dataset of non-invasive electromyographic signals recorded at the wrists while touch typing on a QWERTY keyboard, together with ground-truth annotations and reproducible baselines. With 1,135 sessions spanning 108 users and 346 hours of recording, this is the largest such public dataset to date. These data demonstrate non-trivial, but well defined hierarchical relationships both in terms of the generative process, from neurons to muscles and muscle combinations, as well as in terms of domain shift across users and user sessions. Applying standard modeling techniques from the closely related field of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), we show strong baseline performance on predicting key-presses using sEMG signals alone. We believe the richness of this task and dataset will facilitate progress in several problems of interest to both the machine learning and neuroscientific communities.

End-to-end Learnable Clustering for Intent Learning in Recommendation
Intent learning, which aims to learn users' intents for user understanding and item recommendation, has become a hot research spot in recent years. However, the existing methods suffer from complex and cumbersome alternating optimization, limiting the performance and scalability. To this end, we propose a novel intent learning method termed ELCRec, by unifying behavior representation learning into an End-to-end Learnable Clustering framework, for effective and efficient Recommendation. Concretely, we encode users' behavior sequences and initialize the cluster centers (latent intents) as learnable neurons. Then, we design a novel learnable clustering module to separate different cluster centers, thus decoupling users' complex intents. Meanwhile, it guides the network to learn intents from behaviors by forcing behavior embeddings close to cluster centers. This allows simultaneous optimization of recommendation and clustering via mini-batch data. Moreover, we propose intent-assisted contrastive learning by using cluster centers as self-supervision signals, further enhancing mutual promotion. Both experimental results and theoretical analyses demonstrate the superiority of ELCRec from six perspectives. Compared to the runner-up, ELCRec improves NDCG@5 by 8.9% and reduces computational costs by 22.5% on Beauty dataset. Furthermore, due to the scalability and universal applicability, we deploy this method on the industrial recommendation system with 130 million page views and achieve promising results. The codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ICML2024-2486-ELCRec.

Energy-based Epistemic Uncertainty for Graph Neural Networks
In domains with interdependent data, such as graphs, quantifying the epistemic uncertainty of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is challenging as uncertainty can arise at different structural scales. Existing techniques neglect this issue or only distinguish between structure-aware and structure-agnostic uncertainty without combining them into a single measure. We propose GEBM, an energy-based model (EBM) that provides high-quality uncertainty estimates by aggregating energy at different structural levels that naturally arise from graph diffusion. In contrast to logit-based EBMs, we provably induce an integrable density in the data space by regularizing the energy function. We introduce an evidential interpretation of our EBM that significantly improves the predictive robustness of the GNN. Our framework is a simple and effective post hoc method applicable to any pre-trained GNN that is sensitive to various distribution shifts. It consistently achieves the best separation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution data on 6 out of 7 anomaly types while having the best average rank over shifts on *all* datasets.

Energy-Based Modelling for Discrete and Mixed Data via Heat Equations on Structured Spaces
Energy-based models (EBMs) offer a flexible framework for probabilistic modelling across various data domains. However, training EBMs on data in discrete or mixed state spaces poses significant challenges due to the lack of robust and fast sampling methods. In this work, we propose to train discrete EBMs with Energy Discrepancy, a loss function which only requires the evaluation of the energy function at data points and their perturbed counterparts, thus eliminating the need for Markov chain Monte Carlo. We introduce perturbations of the data distribution by simulating a diffusion process on the discrete state space endowed with a graph structure. This allows us to inform the choice of perturbation from the structure of the modelled discrete variable, while the continuous time parameter enables fine-grained control of the perturbation. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches in a wide range of applications, including the estimation of discrete densities with non-binary vocabulary and binary image modelling. We also introduce the first application of EBMs to tabular data sets with applications in synthetic data generation and calibrated classification.

Energy-Guided Continuous Entropic Barycenter Estimation for General Costs
Optimal transport (OT) barycenters are a mathematically grounded way of averaging probability distributions while capturing their geometric properties. In short, the barycenter task is to take the average of a collection of probability distributions w.r.t. given OT discrepancies. We propose a novel algorithm for approximating the continuous Entropic OT (EOT) barycenter for arbitrary OT cost functions. Our approach is built upon the dual reformulation of the EOT problem based on weak OT, which has recently gained the attention of the ML community. Beyond its novelty, our method enjoys several advantageous properties: (i) we establish quality bounds for the recovered solution; (ii) this approach seamlessly interconnects with the Energy-Based Models (EBMs) learning procedure enabling the use of well-tuned algorithms for the problem of interest; (iii) it provides an intuitive optimization scheme avoiding min-max, reinforce and other intricate technical tricks. For validation, we consider several low-dimensional scenarios and image-space setups, including non-Euclidean cost functions. Furthermore, we investigate the practical task of learning the barycenter on an image manifold generated by a pretrained generative model, opening up new directions for real-world applications.

Enhancing Consistency-Based Image Generation via Adversarialy-Trained Classification and Energy-Based Discrimination
The recently introduced Consistency models pose an efficient alternative to diffusion algorithms, enabling rapid and good quality image synthesis. These methods overcome the slowness of diffusion models by directly mapping noise to data, while maintaining a (relatively) simpler training. Consistency models enable a fast one- or few-step generation, but they typically fall somewhat short in sample quality when compared to their diffusion origins. In this work we propose a novel and highly effective technique for post-processing Consistency-based generated images, enhancing their perceptual quality. Our approach utilizes a joint classifier-discriminator model, in which both portions are trained adversarially. While the classifier aims to grade an image based on its assignment to a designated class, the discriminator portion of the very same network leverages the softmax values to assess the proximity of the input image to the targeted data manifold, thereby serving as an Energy-based Model. By employing example-specific projected gradient iterations under the guidance of this joint machine, we refine synthesized images and achieve an improved FID scores on the ImageNet 64x64 dataset for both Consistency-Training and Consistency-Distillation techniques.

Enhancing Graph Transformers with Hierarchical Distance Structural Encoding
Graph transformers need strong inductive biases to derive meaningful attention scores. Yet, current methods often fall short in capturing longer ranges, hierarchical structures, or community structures, which are common in various graphs such as molecules, social networks, and citation networks. This paper presents a Hierarchical Distance Structural Encoding (HDSE) method to model node distances in a graph, focusing on its multi-level, hierarchical nature. We introduce a novel framework to seamlessly integrate HDSE into the attention mechanism of existing graph transformers, allowing for simultaneous application with other positional encodings. To apply graph transformers with HDSE to large-scale graphs, we further propose a high-level HDSE that effectively biases the linear transformers towards graph hierarchies. We theoretically prove the superiority of HDSE over shortest path distances in terms of expressivity and generalization. Empirically, we demonstrate that graph transformers with HDSE excel in graph classification, regression on 7 graph-level datasets, and node classification on 11 large-scale graphs, including those with up to a billion nodes. We provide our code in the supplementary and will make it publicly available upon acceptance.

Enhancing Protein Mutation Effect Prediction through a Retrieval-Augmented Framework
Predicting the effects of protein mutations is crucial for analyzing protein functions and understanding genetic diseases. However, existing models struggle to effectively extract mutation-related local structure motifs from protein databases, which hinders their predictive accuracy and robustness. To tackle this problem, we design a novel retrieval-augmented framework for incorporating similar structure information in known protein structures. We create a vector database consisting of local structure motif embeddings from a pre-trained protein structure encoder, which allows for efficient retrieval of similar local structure motifs during mutation effect prediction. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging this method results in the SOTA performance across multiple protein mutation prediction datasets, and offers a scalable solution for studying mutation effects.

Enhancing Robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Lyapunov Exponent Approach
Deep Reinforcement Learning agents achieve state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of simulated control tasks. However, successful applications to real-world problems remain limited. One essential limitation of deep RL is the lack of stability and robustness to noise and adversarial attacks of the learnt policies. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of deep RL policies to a single small state perturbation in deterministic continuous control tasks. We demonstrate that RL policies can be deterministically chaotic as small perturbations to the system state have a large impact on subsequent state and reward trajectories. This unstable non-linear behaviour has two consequences: First, inaccuracies in sensor readings, or adversarial attacks, can cause significant performance degradation; Second, even policies that show robust performance in terms of rewards, may have unpredictable behaviour in practice. These two facets of chaos in RL policies drastically restrict the application of deep RL to real-world problems. To address this issue, we propose an improvement on the successful Dreamer V3 architecture, implementing a Maximal Lyapunov Exponent regularisation. This new approach reduces the chaotic state dynamics, rendering the learnt policies more resilient to sensor noise and adversarial attacks and thereby improving their suitability for real-world applications.

Enhancing Robustness of Graph Neural Networks on Social Media with Explainable Inverse Reinforcement Learning
Adversarial attacks against graph neural networks (GNNs) through perturbations of the graph structure are increasingly common in social network tasks like rumor detection. Social media platforms capture diverse attack sequence samples through both machine and manual screening processes. Investigating effective ways to leverage these adversarial samples to bolster robustness is imperative. We enhance a maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning method with a mixture-of-experts approach to address multi-source graph adversarial attacks. This method reconstructs the attack policy, integrating various attack models and offering feature-level explanations, subsequently generating additional adversarial samples to fortify the robustness of detection models. We devise precise sample guidance and a bidirectional update mechanism to mitigate the deviation resulting from imprecise feature representation and negative sampling within the expansive action space of social graphs, while also expediting policy learning. We take rumor detector as an example targeted GNNs model on real-world rumor datasets. By utilizing a small subset of samples generated by various graph adversarial attack methods, we reconstruct the attack policy, closely approximating the performance of the original attack method. We validate that samples generated by the learned policy enhance model robustness through adversarial training and data augmentation.

Enhancing Robustness of Last Layer Two-Stage Fair Model Corrections
Last-layer retraining methods have emerged as an efficient framework for correcting existing base models. Within this framework, several methods have been proposed to deal with correcting models for subgroup fairness with and without group membership information. Importantly, prior work has demonstrated that many methods are susceptible to noisy labels. To this end, we propose a drop-in correction for label noise in last-layer retraining, and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art worst-group accuracy for a broad range of symmetric label noise and across a wide variety of datasets exhibiting spurious correlations. Our proposed approach uses label spreading on a latent nearest neighbors graph and has minimal computational overhead compared to existing methods.

Enhancing Semi-Supervised Learning via Representative and Diverse Sample Selection
Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a preferred paradigm in many deep learning tasks, which reduces the need for human labor. Previous studies primarily focus on effectively utilising the labelled and unlabeled data to improve performance. However, we observe that how to select samples for labelling also significantly impacts performance, particularly under extremely low-budget settings. The sample selection task in SSL has been under-explored for a long time. To fill in this gap, we propose a Representative and Diverse Sample Selection approach (RDSS). By adopting a modified Frank-Wolfe algorithm to minimise a novel criterion $\alpha$-Maximum Mean Discrepancy ($\alpha$-MMD), RDSS samples a representative and diverse subset for annotation from the unlabeled data. We demonstrate that minimizing $\alpha$-MMD enhances the generalization ability of low-budget learning. Experimental results show that RDSS consistently improves the performance of several popular SSL frameworks and outperforms the state-of-the-art sample selection approaches used in Active Learning (AL) and Semi-Supervised Active Learning (SSAL), even with constrained annotation budgets.

EnOF: Training Accurate Spiking Neural Networks via Enhancing the Output Feature Representation
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained more and more interest as one of the energy-efficient alternatives of conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). They exchange 0/1 spikes for processing information, thus most of the multiplications in networks can be replaced by additions. However, binary spike feature maps will limit the expressiveness of the SNN and result in unsatisfactory performance compared with ANNs. It is shown that a rich output feature representation, i.e., the feature vector before classifier) is beneficial to training an accurate model in ANNs for classification. We wonder if it also does for SNNs and how to improve the feature representation of the SNN.To this end, we materialize this idea in two special designed methods for SNNs.First, inspired by some ANN-SNN methods that directly copy-paste the weight parameters from trained ANN with light modification to homogeneous SNN can obtain a well-performed SNN, we use rich information of the weight parameters from the trained ANN counterpart to guide the feature representation learning of the SNN. In particular, we present the SNN's and ANN's feature representation from the same input to ANN's classifier to product SNN's and ANN's outputs respectively and then align the feature with the KL-divergence loss as in knowledge distillation methods, called L_ AF loss.It can be seen as a novel and effective knowledge distillation method specially designed for the SNN that comes from both the knowledge distillation and ANN-SNN methods. Various ablation study shows that the L_AF loss is more powerful than the vanilla knowledge distillation method.Second, we replace the last Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) activation layer as the ReLU activation layer to generate the output feature, thus a more powerful SNN with full-precision feature representation can be achieved but with only a little extra computation.Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms on both popular non-spiking static and neuromorphic datasets. We provide an extremely simple but effective way to train high-accuracy spiking neural networks.

Enriching Disentanglement: From Logical Definitions to Quantitative Metrics
Disentangling the explanatory factors in complex data is a promising approach for generalizable and data-efficient representation learning. While a variety of quantitative metrics for learning and evaluating disentangled representations have been proposed, it remains unclear what properties these metrics truly quantify. In this work, we establish a theoretical connection between logical definitions of disentanglement and quantitative metrics using topos theory and enriched category theory. We introduce a systematic approach for converting a first-order predicate into a real-valued quantity by replacing (i) equality with a strict premetric, (ii) the Heyting algebra of binary truth values with a quantale of continuous values, and (iii) quantifiers with aggregators. The metrics induced by logical definitions have strong theoretical guarantees, and some of them are easily differentiable and can be used as learning objectives directly. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metrics by isolating different aspects of disentangled representations.

EnsIR: An Ensemble Algorithm for Image Restoration via Gaussian Mixture Models
Image restoration has experienced significant advancements due to the development of deep learning. Nevertheless, it encounters challenges related to ill-posed problems, resulting in deviations between single model predictions and ground-truths. Ensemble learning, as a powerful machine learning technique, aims to address these deviations by combining the predictions of multiple base models. Most existing works adopt ensemble learning during the design of restoration models, while only limited research focuses on the inference-stage ensemble of pre-trained restoration models. Regression-based methods fail to enable efficient inference, leading researchers in academia and industry to prefer averaging as their choice for post-training ensemble. To address this, we reformulate the ensemble problem of image restoration into Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and employ an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm to estimate ensemble weights for aggregating prediction candidates. We estimate the range-wise ensemble weights on a reference set and store them in a lookup table (LUT) for efficient ensemble inference on the test set. Our algorithm is model-agnostic and training-free, allowing seamless integration and enhancement of various pre-trained image restoration models. It consistently outperforms regression-based methods and averaging ensemble approaches on 14 benchmarks across 3 image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring and deraining. The codes and all estimated weights will be released.

Entropy testing and its application to testing Bayesian networks
This paper studies the problem of \emph{entropy identity testing}: given sample access to a distribution $p$ and a fully described distribution $q$, and the promise that either $p = q$ or $ | H(p) - H(q) | \geqslant \varepsilon$, where $H(\cdot)$ denotes the Shannon entropy, a tester needs to distinguish between the two cases with high probability. We establish a near-optimal sample complexity bound of $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{k}/\varepsilon + {1}/{\varepsilon^2}$) for this problem, and show how to apply it to the problem of identity testing for in-degree-$d$ $n$-dimensional Bayesian networks, obtaining an upper bound of $\tilde{O}\left( {2^{d / 2} n}/{\varepsilon^2} + {n^2}/{\varepsilon^4} \right)$. This improves on the sample complexity bound of $\tilde{O}(2^{d/2}n^2/\varepsilon^4)$ from Canonne, Diakonikolas, Kane, and Stewart (2020), which required an additional assumption on the structure of the (unknown) Bayesian network.

Entrywise error bounds for low-rank approximations of kernel matrices
In this paper, we derive *entrywise* error bounds for low-rank approximations of kernel matrices obtained using the truncated eigen-decomposition (or singular value decomposition). While this approximation is well-known to be optimal with respect to the spectral and Frobenius norm error, little is known about the statistical behaviour of individual entries. Our error bounds fill this gap. A key technical innovation is a delocalisation result for the eigenvectors of the kernel matrix corresponding to small eigenvalues, which takes inspiration from the field of Random Matrix Theory. Finally, we validate our theory with an empirical study of a collection of synthetic and real-world datasets.

Equivariant Blurring Diffusion for Hierarchical Molecular Conformer Generation
How can diffusion models process 3D geometries in a coarse-to-fine manner, akin to our multiscale view of the world?In this paper, we address the question by focusing on a fundamental biochemical problem of generating 3D molecular conformers conditioned on molecular graphs in a multiscale manner. Our approach consists of two hierarchical stages: i) generation of coarse-grained fragment-level 3D structure from the molecular graph, and ii) generation of fine atomic details from the coarse-grained approximated structure while allowing the latter to be adjusted simultaneously.For the challenging second stage, which demands preserving coarse-grained information while ensuring SE(3) equivariance, we introduce a novel generative model termed Equivariant Blurring Diffusion (EBD), which defines a forward process that moves towards the fragment-level coarse-grained structure by blurring the fine atomic details of conformers, and a reverse process that performs the opposite operation using equivariant networks.We demonstrate the effectiveness of EBD by geometric and chemical comparison to state-of-the-art denoising diffusion models on a benchmark of drug-like molecules.Ablation studies draw insights on the design of EBD by thoroughly analyzing its architecture, which includes the design of the loss function and the data corruption process.

Equivariant Flow-Matching for Molecular Conformer Generation
Predicting low-energy molecular conformations given a molecular graph is an important but challenging task in computational drug discovery. Existing state-of-the-art approaches either resort to large scale transformer-based models that diffuse over conformer fields, or use computationally expensive methods to generate initial structures and diffuse over torsion angles. In this work, we introduce Equivariant Transformer Flow (ET-Flow). We showcase that a well-designed flow matching approach with equivariance and harmonic prior alleviates the need for complex internal geometry calculations and large architectures, contrary to the prevailing methods in the field. Our approach results in a straightforward and scalable method that directly operates on all-atom coordinates with minimal assumptions. ET-Flow outperforms or matches the previous state-of-the-art in molecular conformer generation benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters, no dependence on internal geometry, and fast inference.

Equivariant Machine Learning on Graphs with Nonlinear Spectral Filters
Equivariant machine learning is an approach for designing deep learning models that respect the symmetries of the problem, with the aim of reducing model complexity and improving generalization. In this paper, we focus on an extension of shift equivariance, which is the basis of convolution networks on images, to general graphs. Unlike images, graphs do not have a natural notion of domain translation. Therefore, we consider the graph functional shifts as the symmetry group: the unitary operators that commute with the graph shift operator. Notably, such symmetries operate in the signal space rather than directly in the spatial space.We remark that each linear filter layer of a standard spectral graph neural network (GNN) commutes with graph functional shifts, but the activation function breaks this symmetry. Instead, we propose nonlinear spectral filters (NLSFs) that are fully equivariant to graph functional shifts and show that they have universal approximation properties. The proposed NLSFs are based on a new form of spectral domain that is transferable between graphs. We demonstrate the superior performance of NLSFs over existing spectral GNNs in node and graph classification benchmarks.

Era3D: High-Resolution Multiview Diffusion using Efficient Row-wise Attention
In this paper, we introduce Era3D, a novel multiview diffusion method that generates high-resolution multiview images from a single image. Despite significant advancements in multiview generation, existing methods still suffer from camera prior mismatch, inefficacy, and low resolution resulting in poor-quality multiview images. Specifically, these methods assume that the input images should comply with a predefined camera type, e.g., a perspective camera with a fixed focal length, leading to distorted shapes when the assumption fails. Moreover, the full-image or dense multiview attention they employ leads to an exponential explosion of computational complexity as image resolution increases, resulting in prohibitively expensive training costs. To bridge the gap between assumption and reality, Era3D first proposes a diffusion-based camera prediction module to estimate the focal length and elevation degree of the input image, which allows our method to produce feasible images without shape distortions. Furthermore, a simple but efficient attention layer, named row-wise attention, is used to enforce epipolar priors in the multiview diffusion, facilitating efficient cross-view information fusion. Consequently, compared with state-of-the-art methods, Era3D generates high-quality multiview images with up to a 512×512 resolution while reducing computation complexity by 12x times. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Era3D can reconstruct high-quality and detailed 3D meshes from diverse single-view input images, significantly outperforming baseline multiview diffusion methods.

Erasing Undesirable Concepts in Diffusion Models with Adversarial Preservation
Diffusion models excel at generating visually striking content from text but can inadvertently produce undesirable or harmful content when trained on unfiltered internet data. A practical solution is to selectively removing target concepts from the model, but this may impact the remaining concepts. Prior approaches have tried to balance this by introducing a loss term to preserve neutral content or a regularization term to minimize changes in the model parameters, yet resolving this trade-off remains challenging. In this work, we propose to identify and preserving concepts most affected by parameter changes, termed as *adversarial concepts*. This approach ensures stable erasure with minimal impact on the other concepts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using the Stable Diffusion model, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods in eliminating unwanted content while maintaining the integrity of other unrelated elements.

Error Analysis of Spherically Constrained Least Squares Reformulation in Solving the Stackelberg Prediction Game
The Stackelberg prediction game (SPG) is a popular model for characterizing strategic interactions between a learner and an adversarial data provider. Although optimization problems in SPGs are often NP-hard, a notable special case involving the least squares loss (SPG-LS) has gained significant research attention recently, (Bishop et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2022). The latest state-of-the-art method for solving the SPG-LS problem is the spherically constrained least squares reformulation (SCLS) method proposed in the work of Wang et al. (2022). However, the lack of theoretical analysis on the error of the SCLS method limits its large-scale applications. In this paper, we investigate the estimation error between the learner obtained by the SCLS method and the actual learner. Specifically, we reframe the estimation error of the SCLS method as a Primary Optimization ($\textbf{PO}$) problem and utilize the Convex Gaussian min-max theorem (CGMT) to transform the $\textbf{PO}$ problem into an Auxiliary Optimization ($\textbf{AO}$) problem. Subsequently, we provide a theoretical error analysis for the SCLS method based on this simplified $\textbf{AO}$ problem. This analysis not only strengthens the theoretical framework of the SCLS method but also confirms the reliability of the learner produced by it. We further conduct experiments to validate our theorems, and the results are in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions.

Error Correction Output Codes for Robust Neural Networks against Weight-errors: A Neural Tangent Kernel Point of View
Error correcting output code (ECOC) is a classic method that encodes binary classifiers to tackle the multi-class classification problem in decision trees and neural networks.Among ECOCs, the one-hot code has become the default choice in modern deep neural networks (DNNs) due to its simplicity in decision making. However, it suffers from a significant limitation in its ability to achieve high robust accuracy, particularly in the presence of weight errors. While recent studies have experimentally demonstrated that the non-one-hot ECOCs with multi-bits error correction ability, could be a better solution, there is a notable absence of theoretical foundations that can elucidate the relationship between codeword design, weight-error magnitude, and network characteristics, so as to provide robustness guarantees. This work is positioned to bridge this gap through the lens of neural tangent kernel (NTK). We have two important theoretical findings: 1) In clean models (without weight errors), utilizing one-hot code and non-one-hot ECOC is akin to altering decoding metrics from $l_2$ distance to Mahalanobis distance. 2) In non-clean models (with weight errors), if the normalized distance exceeds a threshold, then non-clean DNNs can reach the clean model's accuracy as long as the code length approaches infinity. This threshold is determined by DNN architecture (e.g. layer number, activation), weight error magnitude, and the distance between the output and the nearest codeword. Based on these findings, we further demonstrate how to practically use them to identify optimal ECOCs for simple tasks (short-code ECOCs) and complex tasks (long-code ECOCs), by balancing the code orthogonality (as per finding 1) and code distance (as per finding 2). Extensive experimental results across four datasets and four DNN models validate the superior performance of constructed codes, guided by our findings, compared to existing ECOCs. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that provides theoretical explanations for the effectiveness of ECOCS and offers associated design guidance for optimal ECOCs specifically tailored to DNNs.

Estimating Ego-Body Pose from Doubly Sparse Egocentric Video Data
We study the problem of estimating the body movements of a camera wearer from egocentric videos. Current methods for ego-body pose estimation rely on temporally dense sensor data, such as IMU measurements from spatially sparse body parts like the head and hands. However, we propose that even temporally sparse observations, such as hand poses captured intermittently from egocentric videos during natural or periodic hand movements, can effectively constrain overall body motion. Naively applying diffusion models to generate full-body pose from head pose and sparse hand pose leads to suboptimal results. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage approach that decomposes the problem into temporal completion and spatial completion. First, our method employs masked autoencoders to impute hand trajectories by leveraging the spatiotemporal correlations between the head pose sequence and intermittent hand poses, providing uncertainty estimates. Subsequently, we employ conditional diffusion models to generate plausible full-body motions based on these temporally dense trajectories of the head and hands, guided by the uncertainty estimates from the imputation. The effectiveness of our methods was rigorously tested and validated through comprehensive experiments conducted on various HMD setup with AMASS and Ego-Exo4D datasets.

Estimating Fréchet bounds for validating programmatic weak supervision
We develop methods for estimating Fréchet bounds on (possibly high-dimensional) distribution classes in which some variables are continuous-valued. We establish the statistical correctness of the computed bounds under uncertainty in the marginal constraints and demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithms by evaluating the performance of machine learning (ML) models trained with programmatic weak supervision (PWS). PWS is a framework for principled learning from weak supervision inputs (e.g. crowdsourced labels, knowledge bases, pre-trained models on related tasks, etc.), and it has achieved remarkable success in many areas of science and engineering. Unfortunately, it is generally difficult to validate the performance of ML models trained with PWS due to the absence of labeled data. Our algorithms address this issue by estimating sharp lower and upper bounds for performance metrics such as accuracy/recall/precision/F1 score.

ETO:Efficient Transformer-based Local Feature Matching by Organizing Multiple Homography Hypotheses
We tackle the efficiency problem of learning local feature matching.Recent advancements have given rise to purely CNN-based and transformer-based approaches, each augmented with deep learning techniques. While CNN-based methods often excel in matching speed, transformer-based methods tend to provide more accurate matches. We propose an efficient transformer-based network architecture for local feature matching.This technique is built on constructing multiple homography hypotheses to approximate the continuous correspondence in the real world and uni-directional cross-attention to accelerate the refinement. On the YFCC100M dataset, our matching accuracy is competitive with LoFTR, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture, while the inference speed is boosted to 4 times, even outperforming the CNN-based methods.Comprehensive evaluations on other open datasets such as Megadepth, ScanNet, and HPatches demonstrate our method's efficacy, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance a wide array of downstream applications.

Evaluate then Cooperate: Shapley-based View Cooperation Enhancement for Multi-view Clustering
The fundamental goal of deep multi-view clustering is to achieve preferable task performance through inter-view cooperation. Although numerous DMVC approaches have been proposed, the collaboration role of individual views have not been well investigated in existing literature. Moreover, how to further enhance view cooperation for better fusion still needs to be explored. In this paper, we firstly consider DMVC as an unsupervised cooperative game where each view can be regarded as a participant. Then, we introduce the Shapley value and propose a novel MVC framework termed Shapley-based Cooperation Enhancing Multi-view Clustering (SCE-MVC), which evaluates view cooperation with game theory. Specially,  we employ the optimal transport distance between fused cluster distributions and single view component as the utility function for computing shapley values. Afterwards, we apply shapley values to assess the contribution of each view and utilize these contributions to promote view cooperation. Comprehensive experimental results well support the effectiveness of our framework adopting to existing DMVC frameworks, demonstrating the importance and necessity of enhancing the cooperation among views.

Evaluating alignment between humans and neural network representations in image-based learning tasks
Humans represent scenes and objects in rich feature spaces, carrying information that allows us to generalise about category memberships and abstract functions with few examples. What determines whether a neural network model generalises like a human? We tested how well the representations of 77 pretrained neural network models mapped to human learning trajectories across two tasks where humans had to learn continuous relationships and categories of natural images. In these tasks, both human participants and neural networks successfully identified the relevant stimulus features within a few trials, demonstrating effective generalisation. We found that while training dataset size was a core determinant of alignment with human choices, contrastive training with multi-modal data (text and imagery) was a common feature of models that predicted human generalisation. Factors such as model size and intrinsic dimensionality had different effects on alignment for different model types. Lastly, we tested three sets of human-aligned representations and found that only one alignment method improved predictive accuracy in our tasks compared to the baselines. In conclusion, pretrained neural networks can serve to extract representations for cognitive models, as they appear to capture some fundamental aspects of cognition that are transferable across tasks. Both our paradigms and modelling approach offer a novel way to quantify alignment between neural networks and humans and extend cognitive science into more naturalistic domains.

Evaluating the design space of diffusion-based generative models
Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al., 2022]. It also provides some perspectives on why the time and variance schedule used in [Karras et al., 2022] could be better tuned than the pioneering version in [Song et al., 2021].

Even Sparser Graph Transformers
Graph Transformers excel in long-range dependency modeling, but generally require quadratic memory complexity in the number of nodes in an input graph, and hence have trouble scaling to large graphs. Sparse attention variants such as Exphormer can help, but may require high-degree augmentations to the input graph for good performance, and do not attempt to sparsify an already-dense input graph. As the learned attention mechanisms tend to use few of these edges, however, such high-degree connections may be unnecessary. We show (empirically and with theoretical backing) that attention scores on graphs are usually quite consistent across network widths, and use this observation to propose a two-stage procedure, which we call Spexphormer: first, train a narrow network on the full augmented graph. Next, use only the active connections to train a wider network on a much sparser graph. We establish theoretical conditions when a narrow network's attention scores can match those of a wide network, and show that Spexphormer achieves good performance with drastically reduced memory requirements on various graph datasets.

Event-3DGS: Event-based 3D Reconstruction Using 3D Gaussian Splatting
Event cameras, offering high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing 3D reconstruction challenges in fast-motion and low-light scenarios. Most methods use the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for event-based photorealistic 3D reconstruction. However, these NeRF methods suffer from time-consuming training and inference, as well as limited scene-editing capabilities of implicit representations. To address these problems, we propose Event-3DGS, the first event-based reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) for synthesizing novel views freely from event streams. Technically, we first propose an event-based 3DGS framework that directly processes event data and reconstructs 3D scenes by simultaneously optimizing scenario and sensor parameters. Then, we present a high-pass filter-based photovoltage estimation module, which effectively reduces noise in event data to improve the robustness of our Event-3DGS in real-world scenarios. Finally, we design an event-based 3D reconstruction loss to optimize the parameters of our Event-3DGS for better reconstruction quality. The results show that our Event-3DGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality on both simulated and real-world datasets. We also verify that our Event-3DGS can perform robust 3D reconstruction even in real-world scenarios with extreme noise, fast motion, and low-light conditions. Our code can be available in the supplementary material.

Everyday Object Meets Vision-and-Language Navigation Agent via Backdoor
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore environments following natural language.The VLN agent, closely integrated into daily lives, poses a substantial threat to the security of privacy and property upon the occurrence of malicious behavior.However, this serious issue has long been overlooked.In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of an object-aware backdoored VLN, achieved by implanting object-aware backdoors during the training phase. Tailored to the unique VLN nature of cross-modality and continuous decision-making, we propose a novel backdoored VLN paradigm: IPR Backdoor. This enables the agent to act in abnormal behavior once encountering the object triggers during language-guided navigation in unseen environments, thereby executing an attack on the target scene.Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both physical and digital spaces across different VLN agents, as well as its robustness to various visual and textual variations. Additionally, our method also well ensures navigation performance in normal scenarios with remarkable stealthiness.

Evidential Mixture Machines: Deciphering Multi-Label Correlations for Active Learning Sensitivity
Multi-label active learning is an essential and challenging aspect of contemporary machine learning, often hindered by the complexities of managing expansive and sparse label spaces. This challenge is intensified in active learning scenarios where labeling resources are limited. Drawing inspiration from existing mixture of Bernoulli models, which effectively compress the label space into a more manageable weight coefficient space through the learning of correlated Bernoulli components, we introduce a novel evidential mixture machines (EMM) model. This model leverages mixture components obtained through label-space unsupervised learning while enhancing prediction accuracy by learning to predict coefficients evidentially and aggregating component offset predictions as proxy pseudo counts. The evidential learning of coefficients provides an uncertainty-aware connection from input features to the predicted coefficients and components. Furthermore, our approach employs the evidential uncertainty combined with predicted label embedding covariances for active sample selection, leading to a multi-source uncertainty metric that is richer than simple uncertainty scores. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of evidential uncertainty prediction and capturing the label correlation using predicted components and experiments on real-world datasets show improved performance over existing multi-label active learning methods.

Exact Gradients for Stochastic Spiking Neural Networks Driven by Rough Signals
We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework based on rough path theory to model stochastic spiking neural networks (SSNNs) as stochastic differential equations with event discontinuities (Event SDEs) and driven by càdlàg rough paths. Our formalism is general enough to allow for potential jumps to be present both in the solution trajectories as well as in the driving noise. We then identify a set of sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of pathwise gradients of solution trajectories and event times with respect to the network's parameters and show how these gradients satisfy a recursive relation. Furthermore, we introduce a general-purpose loss function defined by means of a new class of signature kernels indexed on càdlàg rough paths and use it to train SSNNs as generative models. We provide an end-to-end autodifferentiable solver for Event SDEs  and make its implementation available as part of the $\texttt{diffrax}$ library. Our framework is, to our knowledge, the first enabling gradient-based training of SSNNs with noise affecting both the spike timing and the network's dynamics.

Exact, Tractable Gauss-Newton Optimization in Deep Reversible Architectures Reveal Poor Generalization
Second-order optimization has been shown to accelerate the training of deep neural networks in many applications, often yielding faster progress per iteration on the training loss compared to first-order optimizers. However, the generalization properties of second-order methods are still being debated. Theoretical investigations have proved difficult to carry out outside the tractable settings of heavily simplified model classes - thus, the relevance of existing theories to practical deep learning applications remains unclear. Similarly, empirical studies in large-scale models and real datasets are significantly confounded by the necessity to approximate second-order updates in practice. It is often unclear whether the observed generalization behaviour arises specifically from the second-order nature of the parameter updates, or instead reflects the specific structured (e.g. Kronecker) approximations used or any damping-based interpolation towards first-order updates. Here, we show for the first time that exact Gauss-Newton (GN) updates take on a tractable form in a class of deep reversible architectures that are sufficiently expressive to be meaningfully applied to common benchmark datasets. We exploit this novel setting to study the training and generalization properties of the GN optimizer. We find that exact GN generalizes poorly. In the mini-batch training setting, this manifests as rapidly saturating progress even on the training loss, with parameter updates found to overfit each mini-batch without producing the features that would support generalization to other mini-batches. In contrast to previous work, we show that our experiments run in the feature learning regime, in which the neural tangent kernel (NTK) changes during the course of training. However, changes in the NTK are not associated with any significant change in neural representations, explaining the lack of generalization.

Exogenous Matching: Learning Good Proposals for Tractable Counterfactual Estimation
We propose an importance sampling method for tractable and efficient estimation of counterfactual expressions in general settings, named Exogenous Matching. By minimizing a common upper bound of counterfactual estimators, we transform the variance minimization problem into a conditional distribution learning problem, enabling its integration with existing conditional distribution modeling approaches. We validate the theoretical results through experiments under various types and settings of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and demonstrate the outperformance on counterfactual estimation tasks compared to other existing importance sampling methods. We also explore the impact of injecting structural prior knowledge (Markov boundaries) on the results. Finally, we apply this method to identifiable proxy SCMs and demonstrate the unbiasedness of the estimates, empirically illustrating the applicability of the method to practical scenarios.

Expected Probabilistic Hierarchies
Hierarchical clustering has usually been addressed by discrete optimization using heuristics or continuous optimization of relaxed scores for hierarchies. In this work, we propose to optimize expected scores under a probabilistic model over hierarchies. (1) We show theoretically that the global optimal values of the expected Dasgupta cost and Tree-Sampling divergence (TSD), two unsupervised metrics for hierarchical clustering, are equal to the optimal values of their discrete counterparts contrary to some relaxed scores. (2) We propose Expected Probabilistic Hierarchies (EPH), a probabilistic model to learn hierarchies in data by optimizing expected scores. EPH uses differentiable hierarchy sampling enabling end-to-end gradient descent based optimization, and an unbiased subgraph sampling approach to scale to large datasets. (3) We evaluate EPH on synthetic and real-world datasets including vector and graph datasets. EPH outperforms all other approaches on quantitative results and provides meaningful hierarchies in qualitative evaluations.

Expectile Regularization for Fast and Accurate Training of Neural Optimal Transport
We present a new approach for Neural Optimal Transport (NOT) training procedure, capable of accurately and efficiently estimating optimal transportation plan via specific regularization on dual Kantorovich potentials. The main bottleneck of existing NOT solvers is associated with the procedure of finding a near-exact approximation of the conjugate operator (i.e., the c-transform), which is done either by optimizing over non-convex max-min objectives or by the computationally intensive fine-tuning of the initial approximated prediction. We resolve both issues by proposing a new, theoretically justified loss in the form of expectile regularisation which enforces binding conditions on the learning process of dual potentials. Such a regularization provides the upper bound estimation over the distribution of possible conjugate potentials and makes the learning stable, completely eliminating the need for additional extensive fine-tuning. Proposed method, called Expectile-Regularised Neural Optimal Transport (ENOT), outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on the established Wasserstein-2 benchmark tasks by a large margin (up to a 3-fold improvement in quality and up to a 10-fold improvement in runtime). Moreover, we showcase performance of ENOT for varying cost functions on different tasks, showing robustness of algorithm.

Exploitation of a Latent Mechanism in Graph Contrastive Learning: Representation Scattering
Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted significant attention as it can reduce the heavy dependence of manual labels in training graph neural networks. Most existing GCL methods adopt one of the following frameworks: the InfoNCE-based framework, the DGI framework, or the BGRL framework. Unlike visual contrastive learning, the implementation of these three frameworks in GCL, particularly for node-level tasks, differs significantly. InfoNCE-based methods aim to achieve global uniformity by reducing the similarity between each pair of nodes. In contrast, DGI-like methods treat all nodes in the graph as a single class to distinguish them from their augmented counterparts. Despite their independent approaches, these frameworks achieve similar performances. Hence, we are motivated to investigate whether a common factor underlies the success of these seemingly disparate frameworks. We revisit these methods and discover that they collectively harness a key mechanism, representation scattering, that plays a crucial role in their success. However, existing GCL methods have not fully exploited this mechanism, ignoring its importance. We give a detailed proof in this paper. Based on this discovery, we propose a new contrastive learning method named SGRL. Specifically, SGRL introduces a representation scattering mechanism that explicitly and effectively scatters representations and guides model training. Furthermore, considering the linked nature of nodes, SGRL includes a topology-based constraint mechanism that adaptively integrates representation scattering with topological information. Extensive results from various downstream tasks on datasets of different scales have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of SGRL.

Exploration by Learning Diverse Skills through Successor State Measures
The ability to perform different skills can encourage agents to explore. In this work, we aim to construct a set of diverse skills which uniformly cover the state space. We propose a formalization of this search for diverse skills, building on a previous definition based on the mutual information between states and skills. We consider the distribution of states reached by a policy conditioned on each skill and leverage the successor state measure to maximize the difference between these skill distributions. We call this approach LEADS: Learning Diverse Skills through Successor States. We demonstrate our approach on a set of maze navigation and robotic control tasks which show that our method is capable of constructing a diverse set of skills which exhaustively cover the state space without relying on reward or exploration bonuses. Our findings demonstrate that this new formalization promotes more robust and efficient exploration by combining mutual information maximization and exploration bonuses.

Exploring Adversarial Robustness of Deep State Space Models
Deep State Space Models (SSMs) have proven effective in numerous task scenarios but face significant security challenges due to Adversarial Perturbations (APs) in real-world deployments. Adversarial Training (AT) is a mainstream approach to enhancing Adversarial Robustness (AR) and has been validated on various traditional DNN architectures. However, its effectiveness in improving the AR of SSMs remains unclear.While many enhancements in SSM components, such as integrating Attention mechanisms and expanding to data-dependent SSM parameterizations, have brought significant gains in Standard Training (ST) settings, their potential benefits in AT remain unexplored. To investigate this, we evaluate existing structural variants of SSMs with AT to assess their AR performance. We observe that pure SSM structures struggle to benefit from AT, whereas incorporating Attention yields a markedly better trade-off between robustness and generalization for SSMs in AT compared to other components. Nonetheless, the integration of Attention also leads to Robust Overfitting (RO) issues.To understand these phenomena, we empirically and theoretically  analyze the output error of SSMs under AP. We find that fixed-parameterized SSMs have output error bounds strictly related to their parameters, limiting their AT benefits, while input-dependent SSMs may face the problem of error explosion. Furthermore, we show that the Attention component effectively scales the output error of SSMs during training, enabling them to benefit more from AT, but at the cost of introducing RO due to its high model complexity.Inspired by this, we propose a simple and effective Adaptive Scaling (AdS) mechanism that brings AT performance close to Attention-integrated SSMs without introducing the issue of RO.

Exploring and Exploiting the Asymmetric Valley of Deep Neural Networks
Exploring the loss landscape offers insights into the inherent principles of deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent work suggests an additional asymmetry of the valley beyond the flat and sharp ones, yet without thoroughly examining its causes or implications. Our study methodically explores the factors affecting the symmetry of DNN valleys, encompassing (1) the dataset, network architecture, initialization, and hyperparameters that influence the convergence point; and (2) the magnitude and direction of the noise for 1D visualization. Our major observation shows that the {\it degree of sign consistency} between the noise and the convergence point is a critical indicator of valley symmetry. Theoretical insights from the aspects of ReLU activation and softmax function could explain the interesting phenomenon. Our discovery propels novel understanding and applications in the scenario of Model Fusion: (1) the efficacy of interpolating separate models significantly correlates with their sign consistency ratio, and (2) imposing sign alignment during federated learning emerges as an innovative approach for model parameter alignment.

Exploring Behavior-Relevant and Disentangled Neural Dynamics with Generative Diffusion Models
Understanding the neural basis of behavior is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Current research in large-scale neuro-behavioral data analysis often relies on decoding models, which quantify behavioral information in neural data but lack details on behavior encoding. This raises an intriguing scientific question: "how can we enable in-depth exploration of neural representations in behavioral tasks, revealing interpretable neural dynamics associated with behaviors". However, addressing this issue is challenging due to the varied behavioral encoding across different brain regions and mixed selectivity at the population level. To tackle this limitation, our approach, named ("BeNeDiff"), first identifies a fine-grained and disentangled neural subspace using a behavior-informed latent variable model. It then employs state-of-the-art generative diffusion models to synthesize behavior videos that interpret the neural dynamics of each latent factor. We validate the method on multi-session datasets containing widefield calcium imaging recordings across the dorsal cortex. Through guiding the diffusion model to activate individual latent factors, we verify that the neural dynamics of latent factors in the disentangled neural subspace provide interpretable quantifications of the behaviors of interest. At the same time, the neural subspace in BeNeDiff demonstrates high disentanglement and neural reconstruction quality. Our code is available in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Exploring Consistency in Graph Representations: from Graph Kernels to Graph Neural Networks
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant approach in graph representation learning, yet they often struggle to capture consistent similarity relationships among graphs.  To capture similarity relationships, while graph kernel methods like the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree (WL-subtree) and Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment (WLOA) perform effectively, they are heavily reliant on predefined kernels and lack sufficient non-linearities. Our work aims to bridge the gap between neural network methods and kernel approaches by enabling GNNs to consistently capture relational structures in their learned representations. Given the analogy between the message-passing process of GNNs and WL algorithms, we thoroughly compare and analyze the properties of WL-subtree and WLOA kernels. We find that the similarities captured by WLOA at different iterations are asymptotically consistent, ensuring that similar graphs remain similar in subsequent iterations, thereby leading to superior performance over the WL-subtree kernel. Inspired by these findings, we conjecture that the consistency in the similarities of graph representations across GNN layers is crucial in capturing relational structures and enhancing graph classification performance. Thus, we propose a loss to enforce the similarity of graph representations to be consistent across different layers. Our empirical analysis verifies our conjecture and shows that our proposed consistency loss can significantly enhance graph classification performance across several GNN backbones on various datasets.

Exploring DCN-like architecture for fast image generation with arbitrary resolution
Arbitrary-resolution image generation still remains a challenging task in AIGC, as it requires handling varying resolutions and aspect ratios while maintaining high visual quality. Existing transformer-based diffusion methods suffer from quadratic computation cost and limited resolution extrapolation capabilities, making them less effective for this task. In this paper, we propose FlowDCN, a purely convolution-based generative model with linear time and memory complexity, that can efficiently generate high-quality images at arbitrary resolutions. Equipped with a new design of learnable group-wise deformable convolution block, our FlowDCN yields higher flexibility and capability to handle different resolutions with a single model.FlowDCN achieves the state-of-the-art 4.30 sFID on $256\times256$ ImageNet Benchmark and comparable resolution extrapolation results, surpassing transformer-based counterparts in terms of convergence speed (only $\frac{1}{5}$ images), visual quality, parameters ($8\%$ reduction) and FLOPs ($20\%$ reduction). We believe FlowDCN offers a promising solution to scalable and flexible image synthesis.

Exploring Fixed Point in Image Editing: Theoretical Support and Convergence Optimization
In image editing, Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion has become a widely adopted method and is extensively used in various image editing approaches. The core concept of DDIM inversion stems from the deterministic sampling technique of DDIM, which allows the DDIM process to be viewed as an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) process that is reversible. This enables the prediction of corresponding noise from a reference image, ensuring that the restored image from this noise remains consistent with the reference image. Image editing exploits this property by modifying the cross-attention between text and images to edit specific objects while preserving the remaining regions. However, in the DDIM inversion, using the $t-1$ time step to approximate the noise prediction at time step $t$ introduces errors between the restored image and the reference image. Recent approaches have modeled each step of the DDIM inversion process as finding a fixed-point problem of an implicit function. This approach significantly mitigates the error in the restored image but lacks theoretical support regarding the existence of such fixed points. Therefore, this paper focuses on the study of fixed points in DDIM inversion and provides theoretical support. Based on the obtained theoretical insights, we further optimize the loss function for the convergence of fixed points in the original DDIM inversion, improving the visual quality of the edited image. Finally, we extend the fixed-point based image editing to the application of unsupervised image dehazing, introducing a novel text-based approach for unsupervised dehazing.

Exploring Jacobian Inexactness in Second-Order Methods for Variational Inequalities: Lower Bounds, Optimal Algorithms and Quasi-Newton Approximations
Variational inequalities represent a broad class of problems, including minimization and min-max problems, commonly found in machine learning. Existing second-order and high-order methods for variational inequalities require precise computation of derivatives, often resulting in prohibitively high iteration costs. In this work, we study the impact of Jacobian inaccuracy on second-order methods. For the smooth and monotone case, we establish a lower bound with explicit dependence on the level of Jacobian inaccuracy and propose an optimal algorithm for this key setting. When derivatives are exact, our method converges at the same rate as exact optimal second-order methods. To reduce the cost of solving the auxiliary problem, which arises in all high-order methods with global convergence, we introduce several Quasi-Newton approximations. Our method with Quasi-Newton updates achieves a global sublinear convergence rate. We extend our approach with a tensor generalization for inexact high-order derivatives and support the theory with experiments.

Exploring Low-Dimensional Subspace in Diffusion Models for Controllable Image Editing
Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models with impressive generative capabilities. Despite their success in generating images guided by class or text-to-image conditions, achieving precise and disentangled image generation without additional training remains a significant challenge. In this work, we take one step towards this problem by starting from an intriguing observation: among a certain range of noise levels, the learned posterior mean predictor (PMP) is locally linear, and the singular vectors of its Jacobian lie in low-dimensional semantic subspaces. Under mild data assumptions, we validate the low-rankness and linearity of the PMP, as well as the homogeneity, composability, and linearity of the identified semantic directions within the subspace. These properties are quite universal, appearing consistently across various network architectures (e.g., UNet and Transformers) and datasets. These insights motivate us to propose **LO**w-rank **CO**ntrollable image editing (LOCO Edit). Specifically, the local linearity in the Jacobian provides a single-step, training-free method for precise local editing of regions of interest, while the low-rank nature allows for the effective identification of semantic directions using subspace power methods. Our method is broadly applicable to both undirected and text-directed editing and works across various diffusion-based models. Finally, extensive empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

Exploring Structured Semantic Priors Underlying Diffusion Score for Test-time Adaptation
Capitalizing on the complementary advantages of generative and discriminative models has always been a compelling vision in machine learning, backed by a growing body of research. This work discloses the hidden semantic structure within score-based generative models, unveiling their potential as effective discriminative priors. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we propose DUSA to exploit the structured semantic priors underlying diffusion score to facilitate the test-time adaptation of image classifiers or dense predictors. Notably, DUSA extracts knowledge from a single timestep of denoising diffusion, lifting the curse of Monte Carlo-based likelihood estimation over timesteps. We demonstrate the efficacy of our DUSA in adapting a wide variety of competitive pre-trained discriminative models on diverse test-time scenarios. Additionally, a thorough ablation study is conducted to dissect the pivotal elements in DUSA. Code will be publicly available.

Exploring the Precise Dynamics of Single-Layer GAN Models: Leveraging Multi-Feature Discriminators for High-Dimensional Subspace Learning
Subspace learning is a critical endeavor in contemporary machine learning, particularly given the vast dimensions of modern datasets. In this study, we delve into the training dynamics of a single-layer GAN model from the perspective of subspace learning, framing these GANs as a novel approach to this fundamental task. Through a rigorous scaling limit analysis, we offer insights into the behavior of this model. Extending beyond prior research that primarily focused on sequential feature learning, we investigate the non-sequential scenario, emphasizing the pivotal role of inter-feature interactions in expediting training and enhancing performance, particularly with an uninformed initialization strategy. Our investigation encompasses both synthetic and real-world datasets, such as MNIST, demonstrating the robustness and applicability of our findings to practical scenarios. By bridging our analysis to the realm of subspace learning, we systematically compare the efficacy of GAN-based methods against conventional approaches, both theoretically and empirically. Notably, our results unveil that while all methodologies successfully capture the underlying subspace, GANs exhibit a remarkable capability to acquire a more informative basis, owing to their intrinsic ability to generate new data samples. This elucidates the unique advantage of GAN-based approaches in subspace learning tasks.

Exploring the Role of Large Language Models in Prompt Encoding for Diffusion Models
Large language models~(LLMs)~based on decoder-only transformers have demonstrated superior text understanding capabilities compared to CLIP and T5-series models.However, the paradigm for utilizing current advanced LLMs in text-to-image diffusion models remains to be explored.We observed an unusual phenomenon: directly using a large language model as the prompt encoder significantly degrades the prompt-following ability in image generation.We identified two main obstacles behind this issue.One is the misalignment between the next token prediction training in LLM and the requirement for discriminative prompt features in diffusion models.The other is the intrinsic positional bias introduced by the decoder-only architecture.To deal with this issue, we propose a novel framework to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs.Through the carefully designed usage guidance, we effectively enhance the text representation capability of the LLM for prompt encoding and eliminate its inherent positional bias.This allows us to flexibly integrate state-of-the-art LLMs into the text-to-image generation model.Furthermore, we also provide an effective manner to fuse multiple LLMs into our framework.Considering the excellent performance and scaling capabilities demonstrated by the transformer architecture, we further design an LLM-Infused Diffusion Transformer(LI-DIT)based on the framework.We conduct extensive experiments to validate LI-DIT across model size and data size.Benefiting from the inherent ability of the LLMs and our innovative designs, the prompt understanding performance of  LI-DIT easily surpasses state-of-the-art open-source models as well as mainstream closed-source commercial models including Stable Diffusion 3, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney V6.

Exploring the trade-off between deep-learning and explainable models for brain-machine interfaces
People with brain or spinal cord-related paralysis often need to rely on others for basic tasks, limiting their independence. A potential solution is brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), which could allow them to voluntarily control external devices (e.g., robotic arm) by decoding brain activity to movement commands. In the past decade, deep-learning decoders have achieved state-of-the-art results in most BMI applications, ranging from speech production to finger control. However, the 'black-box' nature of deep-learning decoders could lead to unexpected behaviors, resulting in major safety concerns in real-world physical control scenarios. In these applications, explainable but lower-performing decoders, such as the Kalman filter (KF), remain the norm. In this study, we designed a BMI decoder based on KalmanNet, an extension of the KF that augments its operation with recurrent neural networks to compute the Kalman gain. This results in a varying “trust” that shifts between inputs and dynamics. We used this algorithm to predict finger movements from the brain activity of two monkeys. We compared KalmanNet results offline (pre-recorded data, $n=13$ days) and online (real-time predictions, $n=5$ days) with a simple KF and two recent deep-learning algorithms with state-of-the-art results: tcFNN and LSTM. KalmanNet achieved comparable or better results than other deep learning models in offline and online modes, relying on the dynamical model for stopping while depending more on neural inputs for initiating movements. We further validated this mechanism by implementing a heteroscedastic KF that used the same strategy, and it also approached state-of-the-art performance while remaining in the explainable domain of standard KFs. However, we also see two downsides to KalmanNet. KalmanNet shares the limited generalization ability of existing deep-learning decoders, and its usage of the KF as an inductive bias limits its performance in the presence of unseen noise distributions. Despite this trade-off, our analysis successfully integrates traditional controls and modern deep-learning approaches to motivate high-performing yet still explainable BMI designs.

Extensive-Form Game Solving via Blackwell Approachability on Treeplexes
We introduce the first algorithmic framework for Blackwell approachability on the sequence-form polytope, the class of convex polytopes capturing the strategies of players in extensive-form games (EFGs).This leads to a new class of regret-minimization algorithms that are stepsize-invariant, in the same sense as the Regret Matching and Regret Matching$^+$ algorithms for the simplex.Our modular framework can be combined with any existing regret minimizer over cones to compute a Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum EFGs with perfect recall, through the self-play framework. Leveraging predictive online mirror descent, we introduce *Predictive Treeplex Blackwell$^+$* (PTB$^+$), and show a $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate to Nash equilibrium in self-play. We then show how to stabilize PTB$^+$ with a stepsize, resulting in an algorithm with a state-of-the-art $O(1/T)$ convergence rate. We provide an extensive set of experiments to compare our framework with several algorithmic benchmarks, including CFR$^+$ and its predictive variant, and we highlight interesting connections between practical performance and the stepsize-dependence or stepsize-invariance properties of classical algorithms.

Externally Valid Policy Evaluation from Randomized Trials Using Additional Observational Data
Randomized trials are widely considered as the gold standard for evaluating the effects of decision policies. Trial data is, however, drawn from a population which may differ from the intended target population and this raises a problem of external validity (aka. generalizability). In this paper we seek to use trial data to draw valid inferences about the outcome of a policy on the target population. Additional covariate data from the target population is used to model the sampling of individuals in the trial study. We develop a method that yields certifiably valid trial-based policy evaluations under any specified range of model miscalibrations. The method is nonparametric and the validity is assured even with finite samples. The certified policy evaluations are illustrated using both simulated and real data.

Ex Uno Pluria: Insights on Ensembling in Low Precision Number Systems
While ensembling deep neural networks has shown promise in improving generalization performance, scaling current ensemble methods for large models remains challenging.Given that recent progress in deep learning is largely driven by the scale, exemplified by the widespread adoption of large-scale neural network architectures, scalability emerges an increasingly critical issue for machine learning algorithms in the era of large-scale models.In this work, we first showcase the potential of low precision ensembling, where ensemble members are derived from a single model within low precision number systems in a training-free manner.Our empirical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed low precision ensembling method compared to existing ensemble approaches.

Eye-gaze Guided Multi-modal Alignment for Medical Representation Learning
In the medical multi-modal frameworks, the alignment of cross-modality features presents a significant challenge. However, existing works have learned features that are implicitly aligned from the data, without considering the explicit relationships in the medical context. This data-reliance may lead to low generalization of the learned alignment relationships. In this work, we propose the Eye-gaze Guided Multi-modal Alignment (EGMA) framework to harness eye-gaze data for better alignment of medical visual and textual features. We explore the natural auxiliary role of radiologists' eye-gaze data in aligning medical images and text, and introduce a novel approach by using eye-gaze data, collected synchronously by radiologists during diagnostic evaluations. We conduct downstream tasks of image classification and image-text retrieval on four medical datasets, where EGMA achieved state-of-the-art performance and stronger generalization across different datasets. Additionally, we explore the impact of varying amounts of eye-gaze data on model performance, highlighting the feasibility and utility of integrating this auxiliary data into multi-modal alignment framework.

Face2QR: A Unified Framework for Aesthetic, Face-Preserving, and Scannable QR Code Generation
Existing methods to generate aesthetic QR codes, such as image and style transfer techniques, tend to compromise either the visual appeal or the scannability of QR codes when they incorporate human face identity. Addressing these imperfections, we present Face2QR—a novel pipeline specifically designed for generating personalized QR codes that harmoniously blend aesthetics, face identity, and scannability. Our pipeline introduces three innovative components. First, the ID-refined QR integration (IDQR) seamlessly intertwines the background styling with face ID, utilizing a unified SD-based framework with control networks. Second, the ID-aware QR ReShuffle (IDRS) effectively rectifies the conflicts between face IDs and QR patterns, rearranging QR modules to maintain the integrity of facial features without compromising scannability. Lastly, the ID-preserved Scannability Enhancement (IDSE) markedly boosts scanning robustness through latent code optimization, striking a delicate balance between face ID, aesthetic quality and QR functionality. In comprehensive experiments, Face2QR demonstrates remarkable performance, outperforming existing approaches, particularly in preserving facial recognition features within custom QR code designs.

Facilitating Multimodal Classification via Dynamically Learning Modality Gap
Multimodal learning falls into the trap of the optimization dilemma due to the modality imbalance phenomenon, leading to unsatisfactory performance in real applications. A core reason for modality imbalance is that the models of each modality converge at different rates. Many attempts naturally focus on adjusting learning procedures adaptively. Essentially, the reason why models converge at different rates is because the difficulty of fitting category labels is inconsistent for each modality during learning. From the perspective of fitting labels, we find that appropriate positive intervention label fitting can correct this difference in learning ability. By exploiting the ability of contrastive learning to intervene in the learning of category label fitting, we propose a novel multimodal learning approach that dynamically integrates unsupervised contrastive learning and supervised multimodal learning to address the modality imbalance problem. We find that a simple yet heuristic integration strategy can significantly alleviate the modality imbalance phenomenon. Moreover, we design a learning-based integration strategy to integrate two losses dynamically, further improving the performance. Experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art~(SOTA) multimodal learning approaches. The code is available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Dynamic_Modality_Gap_Learning}.

Factorized Diffusion Architectures for Unsupervised Image Generation and Segmentation
We develop a neural network architecture which, trained in an unsupervised manner as a denoising diffusion model, simultaneously learns to both generate and segment images.  Learning is driven entirely by the denoising diffusion objective, without any annotation or prior knowledge about regions during training.  A computational bottleneck, built into the neural architecture, encourages the denoising network to partition an input into regions, denoise them in parallel, and combine the results.  Our trained model generates both synthetic images and, by simple examination of its internal predicted partitions, a semantic segmentation of those images.  Without any finetuning, we directly apply our unsupervised model to the downstream task of segmenting real images via noising and subsequently denoising them.  Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves accurate unsupervised image segmentation and high-quality synthetic image generation across multiple datasets.

Fair and Welfare-Efficient Constrained Multi-Matchings under Uncertainty
We study fair allocation of constrained resources, where a market designer optimizes overall welfare while maintaining group fairness. In many large-scale settings, utilities are not known in advance, but are instead observed after realizing the allocation. We therefore estimate agent utilities using machine learning. Optimizing over estimates requires trading-off between mean utilities and their predictive variances. We discuss these trade-offs under two paradigms for preference modeling -- in the stochastic optimization regime, the market designer has access to a probability distribution over utilities, and in the robust optimization regime they have access to an uncertainty set containing the true utilities with high probability. We discuss utilitarian and egalitarian based objectives, and we explore how to optimize for them under stochastic and robust paradigms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches on three publicly available conference reviewer assignment datasets. The approaches presented enable scalable constrained resource allocation under uncertainty for many different objectives and preference models.

Fair Bilevel Neural Network (FairBiNN): On Balancing fairness and accuracy via Stackelberg Equilibrium
The persistent challenge of bias in machine learning models necessitates robust solutions to ensure parity and equal treatment across diverse groups, particularly in classification tasks. Current methods for mitigating bias often result in information loss and an inadequate balance between accuracy and fairness. To address this, we propose a novel methodology grounded in bilevel optimization principles. Our deep learning-based approach concurrently optimizes for both accuracy and fairness objectives, and under certain assumptions, achieving proven Pareto optimal solutions while mitigating bias in the trained model. Theoretical analysis indicates that the upper bound on the loss incurred by this method is less than or equal to the loss of the Lagrangian approach, which involves adding a regularization term to the loss function. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model primarily on tabular datasets such as UCI Adult and Heritage Health. When benchmarked against state-of-the-art fairness methods, our model exhibits superior performance, advancing fairness-aware machine learning solutions and bridging the accuracy-fairness gap.

FairJob: A Real-World Dataset for Fairness in Online Systems
We introduce a fairness-aware dataset for job recommendation in advertising, designed to foster research in algorithmic fairness within real-world scenarios. It was collected and prepared to comply with privacy standards and business confidentiality. An additional challenge is the lack of access to protected user attributes such as gender, for which we propose a pragmatic solution to obtain a proxy estimate. Despite being anonymized and including a proxy for a sensitive attribute, our dataset preserves predictive power and maintains a realistic and challenging benchmark. This dataset addresses a significant gap in the availability of fairness-focused resources for high-impact domains like advertising -- the actual impact being having access or not to precious employment opportunities, where balancing fairness and utility is a common industrial challenge. We also explore various stages in the advertising process where unfairness can occur and introduce a method to compute a fair utility metric for the job recommendations in online systems case from a biased dataset. Experimental evaluations of bias mitigation techniques on the released dataset demonstrate potential improvements in fairness and the associated trade-offs with utility.

Fair Kernel K-Means: from Single Kernel towards Multiple Kernel
Kernel k-means has been widely studied in machine learning. However, existing kernel k-means methods often ignore the \textit{fairness} issue, which may cause discrimination. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Fair Kernel K-Means (FKKM) framework. In this framework, we first propose a new fairness regularization term that can lead to a fair partition of data. The carefully designed fairness regularization term has a similar form to the kernel k-means which can be seamlessly integrated into the kernel k-means framework. Then, we extend this method to the multiple kernel setting, leading to a Fair Multiple Kernel K-Means (FMKKM) method. We also provide some theoretical analysis of the generalization error bound, and based on this bound we give a strategy to set the hyper-parameter, which makes the proposed methods easy to use. At last, we conduct extensive experiments on both the single kernel and multiple kernel settings to compare the proposed methods with state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate their effectiveness.

Fairness and Efficiency in Online Class Matching
The online bipartite matching problem, extensively studied in the literature, deals with the allocation of online arriving vertices (items) to a predetermined set of offline vertices (agents). However, little attention has been given to the concept of class fairness, where agents are categorized into different classes, and the matching algorithm must ensure equitable distribution across these classes.We here focus on randomized algorithms for the fair matching of indivisible items, subject to various definitions of fairness. Our main contribution is the first (randomized) non-wasteful algorithm that simultaneously achieves a $1/2$ approximation to class envy-freeness (CEF) while simultaneously ensuring an equivalent approximation to the class proportionality (CPROP) and utilitarian social welfare (USW) objectives. We supplement this result by demonstrating that no non-wasteful algorithm can achieve an $\alpha$-CEF guarantee for $\alpha > 0.761$. In a similar vein, we provide a novel input instance for deterministic divisible matching that demonstrates a nearly tight CEF approximation.Lastly, we define the ``price of fairness," which represents the trade-off between optimal and fair matching. We demonstrate that increasing the level of fairness in the approximation of the solution leads to a decrease in the objective of maximizing USW, following an inverse proportionality relationship.

Fairness-Aware Estimation of Graphical Models
This paper examines the issue of fairness in the estimation of graphical models (GMs), particularly Gaussian, Covariance, and Ising models. These models play a vital role in understanding complex relationships in high-dimensional data. However, standard GMs can result in biased outcomes, especially when the underlying data involves sensitive characteristics or protected groups. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to reduce bias in the estimation of GMs related to protected attributes. Our approach involves the integration of the pairwise graph disparity error and a tailored loss function into a nonsmooth multi-objective optimization problem, striving to achieve fairness across different sensitive groups while maintaining the effectiveness of the GMs. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates bias without undermining GMs' performance.

Fairness-Aware Meta-Learning via Nash Bargaining
To address issues of group-level fairness in machine learning, it is natural to adjust model parameters based on specific fairness objectives over a sensitive-attributed validation set. Such an adjustment procedure can be cast within a meta-learning framework. However, naive integration of fairness goals via meta-learning can cause hypergradient conflicts for subgroups, resulting in unstable convergence and compromising model performance and fairness. To navigate this issue, we frame the resolution of hypergradient conflicts as a multi-player cooperative bargaining game. We introduce a two-stage meta-learning in which the first stage involves the use of a Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) to resolve hypergradient conflicts and steer the model toward the Pareto front, and the second stage optimizes upon specific fairness goals. Our method is substantiated by theoretical results, notably a proof of the NBS for gradient aggregation free from linear independence assumptions, a proof of Pareto improvement, and a proof of monotonic improvement in validation loss. We also show empirical effects across various fairness objectives in six key fairness datasets and two image classification tasks.

Fairness in Social Influence Maximization via Optimal Transport
We study fairness in social influence maximization, whereby one seeks to select seeds that spread a given information throughout a network, ensuring balanced outreach among different communities (e.g. demographic groups).In the literature, fairness is often quantified in terms of the expected outreach within individual communities. In this paper, we demonstrate that such fairness metrics can be misleading since they ignore the stochastic nature of information diffusion processes. When information diffusion occurs in a probabilistic manner, multiple outreach scenarios can occur. As such, outcomes such as "in 50% of the cases, no one of group 1 receives the information and everyone in group 2 receives it and in other 50%, the opposite happens", which always results in largely unfair outcomes, are classified as fair by a variety of fairness metrics in the literature. We tackle this problem by designing a new fairness metric, mutual fairness, that captures variability in outreach through optimal transport theory. We propose a new seed-selection algorithm that optimizes both outreach and mutual fairness, and we show its efficacy on several real datasets. We find that our algorithm increases fairness with only a minor decrease (and at times, even an increase) in efficiency.

Fairness without Harm: An Influence-Guided Active Sampling Approach
The pursuit of fairness in machine learning (ML), ensuring that the models do not exhibit biases toward protected demographic groups, typically results in a compromise scenario. This compromise can be explained by a Pareto frontier where given certain resources (e.g., data), reducing the fairness violations often comes at the cost of lowering the model accuracy. In this work, we aim to train models that mitigate group fairness disparity without causing harm to model accuracy.Intuitively, acquiring more data is a natural and promising approach to achieve this goal by reaching a better Pareto frontier of the fairness-accuracy tradeoff. The current data acquisition methods, such as fair active learning approaches, typically require annotating sensitive attributes. However, these sensitive attribute annotations should be protected due to privacy and safety concerns. In this paper, we propose a tractable active data sampling algorithm that does not rely on training group annotations, instead only requiring group annotations on a small validation set. Specifically, the algorithm first scores each new example by its influence on fairness and accuracy evaluated on the validation dataset, and then selects a certain number of examples for training. We theoretically analyze how acquiring more data can improve fairness without causing harm, and validate the possibility of our sampling approach in the context of risk disparity. We also provide the upper bound of generalization error and risk disparity as well as the corresponding connections.Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

Fair Online Bilateral Trade
In online bilateral trade, a platform posts prices to incoming pairs of buyers and sellers that have private valuations for a certain good. If the price is lower than the buyers' valuation and higher than the sellers' valuation, then a trade takes place. Previous work focused on the platform perspective, with the goal of setting prices maximizing the *gain from trade* (the sum of sellers' and buyers' utilities). Gain from trade is, however, potentially unfair to traders, as they may receive highly uneven shares of the total utility. In this work we enforce fairness by rewarding the platform with the _fair gain from trade_, defined as the minimum between sellers' and buyers' utilities.After showing that any no-regret learning algorithm designed to maximize the sum of the utilities may fail badly with fair gain from trade, we present our main contribution: a complete characterization of the regret regimes for fair gain from trade when, after each interaction, the platform only learns whether each trader accepted the current price. Specifically, we prove the following regret bounds: $\Theta(\ln T)$ in the deterministic setting, $\Omega(T)$ in the stochastic setting, and $\tilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$ in the stochastic setting when sellers' and buyers' valuations are independent of each other. We conclude by providing tight regret bounds when, after each interaction, the platform is allowed to observe the true traders' valuations.

Fair Secretaries with Unfair Predictions
Algorithms with predictions is a recent framework for decision-making under uncertainty that leverages the power of machine-learned predictions without making any assumption about their quality. The goal in this framework is for algorithms to achieve an improved performance when the predictions are accurate while maintaining acceptable guarantees when the predictions are erroneous. A serious concern with algorithms that use predictions is that  these predictions can be biased and, as a result, cause the algorithm to make decisions that are deemed unfair. We show that this concern manifests itself in the classical secretary problem in the learning-augmented setting---the state-of-the-art algorithm can have zero probability of accepting the best candidate, which we deem unfair, despite promising to accept a candidate whose expected value is at least $\max\{\Omega (1) , 1 - O(\varepsilon)\}$ times the optimal value, where $\varepsilon$ is the prediction error.We show how to preserve this promise while also guaranteeing to accept the best candidate with probability $\Omega(1)$.  Our algorithm and analysis are based on a new ``pegging'' idea that diverges from existing works and simplifies/unifies some of their results. Finally, we extend to the $k$-secretary problem and complement our theoretical analysis with experiments.

Fair Wasserstein Coresets
Data distillation and coresets have emerged as popular approaches to generate a smaller representative set of samples for downstream learning tasks to handle large-scale datasets. At the same time, machine learning is being increasingly applied to decision-making processes at a societal level, making it imperative for modelers to address inherent biases towards subgroups present in the data. While current approaches focus on creating fair synthetic representative samples by optimizing local properties relative to the original samples, their impact on downstream learning processes has yet to be explored.  In this work, we present fair Wasserstein coresets ($\texttt{FWC}$), a novel coreset approach which generates fair synthetic representative samples along with sample-level weights to be used in downstream learning tasks. $\texttt{FWC}$ uses an efficient majority minimization algorithm to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the original dataset and the weighted synthetic samples while enforcing demographic parity. We show that an unconstrained version of $\texttt{FWC}$ is equivalent to Lloyd's algorithm for k-medians and k-means clustering. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real datasets show that $\texttt{FWC}$:  (i) achieves a competitive fairness-performance tradeoff in downstream models compared to existing approaches, (ii) improves downstream fairness when added to the existing training data and (iii) can be used to reduce biases in predictions from large language models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4).

FairWire: Fair Graph Generation
Machine learning over graphs has recently attracted growing attention due to its ability to analyze and learn complex relations within critical interconnected systems. However, the disparate impact that is amplified by the use of biased graph structures in these algorithms has raised significant concerns for their deployment in real-world decision systems. In addition, while synthetic graph generation has become pivotal for privacy and scalability considerations, the impact of generative learning algorithms on structural bias has not yet been investigated. Motivated by this, this work focuses on the analysis and mitigation of structural bias for both real and synthetic graphs. Specifically, we first theoretically analyze the sources of structural bias that result in disparity for the predictions of dyadic relations. To alleviate the identified bias factors, we design a novel fairness regularizer that offers a versatile use. Faced with the bias amplification in graph generation models brought to light in this work, we further propose a fair graph generation framework, FairWire, by leveraging our fair regularizer design in a generative model. Experimental results on real-world networks validate that the proposed tools herein deliver effective structural bias mitigation for both real and synthetic graphs.

FasMe: Fast and Sample-efficient Meta Estimator for Precision Matrix Learning in Small Sample Settings
Precision matrix estimation is a ubiquitous task featuring numerous applications such as rare disease diagnosis and neural connectivity exploration. However, this task becomes challenging in small sample settings, where the number of samples is significantly less than the number of dimensions, leading to unreliable estimates. Previous approaches either fail to perform well in small sample settings or suffer from inefficient estimation processes, even when incorporating meta-learning techniques.To this end, we propose a novel approach FasMe for Fast and Sample-efficient Meta Precision Matrix Learning, which first extracts meta-knowledge through a multi-task learning diagram. Then, meta-knowledge constraints are applied using a maximum determinant matrix completion algorithm for the novel task. As a result, we reduce the sample size requirements to $O(\log p/K)$ per meta-training task and $O(\log\vert \mathcal{G}\vert)$ for the meta-testing task. Moreover, the hereby proposed model only needs $O(p \log\epsilon^{-1})$ time and $O(p)$ memory for converging to an $\epsilon$-accurate solution. On multiple synthetic and biomedical datasets, FasMe is at least ten times faster than the four baselines while promoting prediction accuracy in small sample settings.

FastDrag: Manipulate Anything in One Step
Drag-based image editing using generative models provides precise control over image contents, enabling users to manipulate anything in an image with a few clicks. However, prevailing methods typically adopt $n$-step iterations for latent semantic optimization to achieve drag-based image editing, which is time-consuming and limits practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel one-step drag-based image editing method, i.e., FastDrag, to accelerate the editing process. Central to our approach is a latent warpage function (LWF), which simulates the behavior of a stretched material to adjust the location of individual pixels within the latent space. This innovation achieves one-step latent semantic optimization and hence significantly promotes editing speeds. Meanwhile, null regions emerging after applying LWF are addressed by our proposed bilateral nearest neighbor interpolation (BNNI) strategy. This strategy interpolates these regions using similar features from neighboring areas, thus enhancing semantic integrity. Additionally, a consistency-preserving strategy is introduced to maintain the consistency between the edited and original images by adopting semantic information from the original image, saved as key and value pairs in self-attention module during diffusion inversion, to guide the diffusion sampling. Our FastDrag is validated on the DragBench dataset, demonstrating substantial improvements in processing time over existing methods, while achieving enhanced editing performance.

Faster Accelerated First-order Methods for Convex Optimization with Strongly Convex Function Constraints
In this paper, we introduce faster accelerated primal-dual algorithms for minimizing a convex function subject to strongly convex function constraints. Prior to our work, the best complexity bound was $\mathcal{O}(1/{\varepsilon})$, regardless of the strong convexity of the constraint function.It is unclear whether the strong convexity assumption can enable even better convergence results. To address this issue, we have developed novel techniques to progressively estimate the strong convexity of the Lagrangian function.Our approach, for the first time, effectively leverages the constraint strong convexity, obtaining an improved complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$. This rate matches the complexity lower bound for strongly-convex-concave saddle point optimization and is therefore order-optimal.We show the superior performance of our methods in sparsity-inducing constrained optimization, notably Google's personalized PageRank problem. Furthermore, we show that a restarted version of the proposed methods can effectively identify the optimal solution's sparsity pattern within a finite number of steps, a result that appears to have independent significance.

Faster Diffusion: Rethinking the Role of the Encoder for Diffusion Model Inference
One of the main drawback of diffusion models is the slow inference time for image generation.   Among the most successful approaches to addressing this problem are distillation methods.  However, these methods require considerable computational resources. In this paper, we take another approach to diffusion model acceleration.   We conduct a comprehensive study of the UNet encoder and empirically analyze the encoder features. This provides insights regarding their changes during the inference process. In particular, we find that encoder features change minimally, whereas the decoder features exhibit substantial variations across different time-steps. This insight motivates us to omit encoder computation at certain adjacent time-steps and reuse encoder features of previous time-steps as input to the decoder in multiple time-steps. Importantly, this allows us to perform decoder computation in parallel, further accelerating the denoising process.  Additionally,  we introduce a prior noise injection method to improve the texture details in the generated image. Besides the standard text-to-image task, we also validate our approach on other tasks: text-to-video, personalized generation and reference-guided generation. Without utilizing any knowledge distillation technique, our approach accelerates both the Stable Diffusion (SD) and DeepFloyd-IF model sampling by 41$\%$ and 24$\%$ respectively, and DiT model sampling by 34$\%$, while maintaining high-quality generation performance. Our code will be publicly released.

FasterDiT: Towards Faster Diffusion Transformers Training without Architecture Modification
Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have attracted significant attention in research. However, they suffer from a slow convergence rate. In this paper, we aim to accelerate DiT training without any architectural modification. We identify the following issues in the training process: firstly, certain training strategies do not consistently perform well across different data. Secondly, the effectiveness of supervision at specific timesteps is limited. In response, we propose the following contributions: (1) We introduce a new perspective for interpreting the failure of the strategies. Specifically, we slightly extend the definition of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and suggest observing the Probability Density Function (PDF) of SNR to understand the essence of the data robustness of the strategy. (2) We conduct numerous experiments and report over one hundred experimental results to empirically summarize a unified accelerating strategy from the perspective of PDF. (3) We develop a new supervision method that further accelerates the training process of DiT. Based on them, we propose FasterDiT, an exceedingly simple and practicable design strategy. With few lines of code modifications, it achieves 2.30 FID on ImageNet 256 resolution at 1000k iterations, which is comparable to DiT (2.27 FID) but 7 times faster in training.

Faster Local Solvers for Graph Diffusion Equations
Efficient computation of graph diffusion equations (GDEs), such as Personalized PageRank, Katz centrality, and the Heat kernel, is crucial for clustering, training neural networks, and many other graph-related problems. Standard iterative methods require accessing the whole graph per iteration, making them time-consuming for large-scale graphs. While existing local solvers approximate diffusion vectors through heuristic local updates, they often operate sequentially and are typically designed for specific diffusion types, limiting their applicability. Given that diffusion vectors are highly localizable, as measured by the participation ratio, this paper introduces a novel framework for approximately solving GDEs using a local diffusion process. This framework reveals the suboptimality of existing local solvers. Furthermore, our approach effectively localizes standard iterative solvers by designing simple and provably sublinear time algorithms. These new local solvers are highly parallelizable, making them well-suited for implementation on GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in quickly obtaining approximate diffusion vectors, achieving up to a hundred-fold speed improvement, and its applicability to large-scale dynamic graphs. Our framework could also facilitate more efficient local message-passing mechanisms for GNNs.

Faster Repeated Evasion Attacks in Tree Ensembles
Tree ensembles are one of the most widely used model classes. However, these models are susceptible to adversarial examples, i.e., slightly perturbed examples that elicit a misprediction. There has been significant research on designing approaches to construct such examples for tree ensembles. But this is a computationally challenging problem that often must be solved a large number of times (e.g., for all examples in a training set). This is compounded by the fact that current approaches attempt to find such examples from scratch. In contrast, we exploit the fact that multiple similar problems are being solved. Specifically, our approach exploits the insight that adversarial examples for tree ensembles tend to perturb a consistent but relatively small set of features. We show that we can quickly identify this set of features and use this knowledge to speedup constructing adversarial examples.

Fast Graph Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Enhancing and Accelerating Few-Shot Node Classification
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance in node classification. However, GNNs perform poorly in the few-shot node classification (FSNC) task that requires robust generalization to make accurate predictions for unseen classes with limited labels. To tackle the challenge, we propose the integration of sharpness-aware minimization (SAM)---a technique designed to enhance model generalization by finding a flat minimum of the loss landscape---into GNN training. The standard SAM approach, however, consists of two forward-backward steps in each training iteration, doubling the computational cost compared to the base optimizer (e.g., Adam). To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a novel algorithm, Fast Graph Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FGSAM), that integrates the rapid training of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) with the superior performance of GNNs. Specifically, we utilize GNNs for parameter perturbation while employing MLPs to minimize the perturbed loss so that we can find a flat minimum with good generalization more efficiently. Moreover, our method ingeniously reutilizes the gradient from the perturbation phase to incorporate graph topology into the minimization process at almost zero additional cost. To further enhance training efficiency, we develop FGSAM+ that executes exact perturbations periodically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the standard SAM with lower computational costs in FSNC tasks. In particular, our FGSAM+ as a SAM variant, for the first time, offers a faster optimization than the base optimizer in most cases. In addition to FSNC, our proposed methods also demonstrate competitive performance in the standard node classification task for heterophilic graphs, highlighting the broad applicability.

Fast Iterative Hard Thresholding Methods with Pruning Gradient Computations
We accelerate the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) method, which finds \(k\) important elements from a parameter vector in a linear regression model. Although the plain IHT repeatedly updates the parameter vector during the optimization, computing gradients is the main bottleneck. Our method safely prunes unnecessary gradient computations to reduce the processing time.The main idea is to efficiently construct a candidate set, which contains \(k\) important elements in the parameter vector, for each iteration. Specifically, before computing the gradients, we prune unnecessary elements in the parameter vector for the candidate set by utilizing upper bounds on absolute values of the parameters. Our method guarantees the same optimization results as the plain IHT because our pruning is safe. Experiments show that our method is up to 73 times faster than the plain IHT without degrading accuracy.

Fast Last-Iterate Convergence of Learning in Games Requires Forgetful Algorithms
Self play via online learning is one of the premier ways to solve large-scale zero-sum games, both in theory and practice. Particularly popular algorithms include optimistic multiplicative weights update (OMWU) and optimistic gradient-descent-ascent (OGDA). While both algorithms enjoy $O(1/T)$ ergodic convergence to Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games, OMWU offers several advantages, including logarithmic dependence on the size of the payoff matrix and $\tilde{O}(1/T)$ convergence to coarse correlated equilibria even in general-sum games. However, in terms of last-iterate convergence in two-player zero-sum games, an increasingly popular topic in this area, OGDA guarantees that the duality gap shrinks at a rate of $(1/\sqrt{T})$, while the best existing last-iterate convergence for OMWU depends on some game-dependent constant that could be arbitrarily large. This begs the question: is this potentially slow last-iterate convergence an inherent disadvantage of OMWU, or is the current analysis too loose? Somewhat surprisingly, we show that the former is true. More generally, we prove that a broad class of algorithms that do not forget the past quickly all suffer the same issue: for any arbitrarily small $\delta>0$, there exists a $2\times 2$ matrix game such that the algorithm admits a constant duality gap even after $1/\delta$ rounds. This class of algorithms includes OMWU and other standard optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader algorithms.

FASTopic: A Fast, Adaptive, Stable, and Transferable Topic Modeling Paradigm
Topic models have been evolving rapidly over the years, from conventional to recent neural models. However, existing topic models generally struggle with either effectiveness, efficiency, or stability, highly impeding their practical applications. In this paper, we propose FASTopic, a fast, adaptive, stable, and transferable topic model. FASTopic follows a new paradigm: Dual Semantic-relation Reconstruction (DSR). Instead of previous conventional, neural VAE-based or clustering-based methods, DSR discovers latent topics by reconstruction through modeling the semantic relations among document, topic, and word embeddings. This brings about a neat and efficient topic modeling framework. We further propose a novel Embedding Transport Plan (ETP) method. Rather than early straightforward approaches, ETP explicitly regularizes the semantic relations as optimal transport plans. This addresses the relation bias issue and thus leads to effective topic modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our FASTopic shows superior effectiveness, efficiency, adaptivity, stability, and transferability, compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various scenarios.

Fast Rates in Stochastic Online Convex Optimization by Exploiting the Curvature of Feasible Sets
In this work, we explore online convex optimization (OCO) and introduce a new condition and analysis that provides fast rates by exploiting the curvature of feasible sets. In online linear optimization, it is known that if the average gradient of loss functions exceeds a certain threshold, the curvature of feasible sets can be exploited by the follow-the-leader (FTL) algorithm to achieve a logarithmic regret. This study reveals that algorithms adaptive to the curvature of loss functions can also leverage the curvature of feasible sets. In particular, we first prove that if an optimal decision is on the boundary of a feasible set and the gradient of an underlying loss function is non-zero, then the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(\rho \log T)$ in stochastic environments. Here, $\rho > 0$ is the radius of the smallest sphere that includes the optimal decision and encloses the feasible set. Our approach, unlike existing ones, can work directly with convex loss functions, exploiting the curvature of loss functions simultaneously, and can achieve the logarithmic regret only with a local property of feasible sets. Additionally, the algorithm achieves an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret even in adversarial environments, in which FTL suffers an $\Omega(T)$ regret, and achieves an $O(\rho \log T + \sqrt{C \rho \log T})$ regret in corrupted stochastic environments with corruption level $C$. Furthermore, by extending our analysis, we establish a matching regret upper bound of $O\Big(T^{\frac{q-2}{2(q-1)}} (\log T)^{\frac{q}{2(q-1)}}\Big)$ for $q$-uniformly convex feasible sets, where uniformly convex sets include strongly convex sets and $\ell_p$-balls for $p \in [1,\infty)$. This bound bridges the gap between the $O(\log T)$ bound for strongly convex sets ($q=2$) and the $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound for non-curved sets ($q\to\infty$).

Fast samplers for Inverse Problems in Iterative Refinement models
Constructing fast samplers for unconditional diffusion and flow-matching models has received much attention recently; however, existing methods for solving inverse problems, such as super-resolution, inpainting, or deblurring, still require hundreds to thousands of iterative steps to obtain high-quality results. We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present **Conditional Conjugate Integrators**, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4x super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as **5** conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps. Our code and models will be made publicly available.

Fast Sampling via Discrete Non-Markov Diffusion Models
Discrete diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality data generation. Despite their success in discrete spaces, such as text generation tasks, the acceleration of discrete diffusion models remains under explored. In this paper, we propose a discrete non-Markov diffusion model, which admits an accelerated reverse sampling for discrete data generation. Our method significantly reduces the number of function evaluations (i.e., calls to the neural network), making the sampling process much faster. Furthermore, we study the transition from finite to infinite step sampling, offering new insights into bridging the gap between discrete and continuous-time processes for discrete diffusion models. Extensive experiments on natural language generation and machine translation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our method in terms of both generation speed and sample quality compared to existing methods for discrete diffusion models.

FastSurvival: Hidden Computational Blessings in Training Cox Proportional Hazards Models
Survival analysis is an important research topic with applications in healthcare, business, and manufacturing. One essential tool in this area is the Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model, which is widely used for its interpretability, flexibility, and predictive performance. However, for modern data science challenges such as high dimensionality (both $n$ and $p$) and high feature correlations, current algorithms to train the CPH model have drawbacks, preventing us from using the CPH model at its full potential. The root cause is that the current algorithms, based on the Newton method, have trouble converging due to vanishing second order derivatives when outside the local region of the minimizer. To circumvent this problem, we propose new optimization methods by constructing and minimizing surrogate functions that exploit hidden mathematical structures of the CPH model. Our new methods are easy to implement and ensure monotonic loss decrease and global convergence. Empirically, we verify the computational efficiency of our methods. As a direct application, we show how our optimization methods can be used to solve the cardinality-constrained CPH problem, producing very sparse high-quality models that were not previously practical to construct. We list several extensions that our breakthrough enables, including optimization opportunities, theoretical questions on CPH's mathematical structure, as well as other CPH-related applications.

Fast Tree-Field Integrators: From Low Displacement Rank to Topological Transformers
We present a new class of fast polylog-linear algorithms based on the theory of structured matrices (in particular *low displacement rank*) for integrating tensor fields defined on weighted trees. Several applications of the resulting *fast tree-field integrators* (FTFIs) are presented, including: (a) approximation of graph metrics with tree metrics, (b) graph classification, (c) modeling on meshes, and finally (d) *Topological Transformers* (TTs) (Choromanski et al., 2022)  for images. For Topological Transformers, we propose new relative position encoding (RPE) masking mechanisms with as few as **three** extra learnable parameters per Transformer layer, leading to **1.0-1.5\%+** accuracy gains. Importantly, most of FTFIs are **exact** methods, thus numerically equivalent to their brute-force counterparts. When applied to graphs with thousands of nodes, those exact algorithms provide **5.7-13x** speedups. We also provide an extensive theoretical analysis of our methods.

Fast yet Safe: Early-Exiting with Risk Control
Scaling machine learning models significantly improves their performance.  However, such gains come at the cost of inference being slow and resource-intensive.  Early-exit neural networks (EENNs) offer a promising solution: they accelerate inference by allowing intermediate layers to exit and produce a prediction early.  Yet a fundamental issue with EENNs is how to determine when to exit without severely degrading performance.  In other words, when is it 'safe' for an EENN to go 'fast'?  To address this issue, we investigate how to adapt frameworks of risk control to EENNs. Risk control offers a distribution-free, post-hoc solution that tunes the EENN's exiting mechanism so that exits only occur when the output is of sufficient quality.  We empirically validate our insights on a range of vision and language tasks, demonstrating that risk control can produce substantial computational savings, all the while preserving user-specified performance goals.

Fearless Stochasticity in Expectation Propagation
Expectation propagation (EP) is a family of algorithms for performing approximate inference in probabilistic models. The updates of EP involve the evaluation of moments—expectations of certain functions—which can be estimated from Monte Carlo (MC) samples. However, the updates are not robust to MC noise when performed naively, and various prior works have attempted to address this issue in different ways. In this work, we provide a novel perspective on the moment-matching updates of EP; namely, that they perform natural-gradient-based optimisation of a variational objective. We use this insight to motivate two new EP variants, with updates that are particularly well-suited to MC estimation; they remain stable and are most sample-efficient when estimated with just a single sample. These new variants combine the benefits of their predecessors and address key weaknesses. In particular, they are easier to tune, offer an improved speed-accuracy trade-off, and do not rely on the use of debiasing estimators. We demonstrate their efficacy on a variety of probabilistic inference tasks.

Federated Behavioural Planes: Explaining the Evolution of Client Behaviour in Federated Learning
Federated Learning (FL), a privacy-aware approach in distributed deep learning environments, enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing sensitive data, thereby reducing privacy risks. However, enabling human trust and control over FL systems requires understanding the evolving behaviour of clients, whether beneficial or detrimental for the training, which still represents a key challenge in the current literature.To address this challenge, we introduce Federated Behavioural Planes (FBPs), a novel method to analyse, visualise, and explain the dynamics of FL systems, showing how clients behave under two different lenses: predictive performance (error behavioural space) and decision-making processes (counterfactual behavioural space). Our experiments demonstrate that FBPs provide informative trajectories describing the evolving states of clients and their contributions to the global model, thereby enabling the identification of clusters of clients with similar behaviours. Leveraging the patterns identified by FBPs, we propose a robust aggregation technique, named Federated Behavioural Shields to enhance security, surpassing the efficacy of existing state-of-the-art defense mechanisms.

FedGMark: Certifiably Robust Watermarking for Federated Graph Learning
Federated graph learning (FedGL) is an emerging learning paradigm to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. However, during the development and deployment of FedGL models, they are susceptible to illegal copying and model theft. Backdoor-based watermarking is a well-known method for mitigating these attacks, as it offers ownership verification to the model owner. We take the first step to protect the ownership of FedGL models via backdoor-based watermarking. Existing techniques have challenges in achieving the goal: 1) they either cannot be directly applied or yield unsatisfactory performance; 2) they are vulnerable to watermark removal attacks; and 3) they lack of formal guarantees. To address all the challenges, we propose FedGMark, the first certified robust backdoor-based watermarking for FedGL. FedGMark leverages the unique graph structure and client information in FedGL to learn customized and diverse watermarks. It also designs a novel GL architecture that facilitates defending against both the empirical and theoretically worst-case watermark removal attacks. Extensive experiments validate the promising empirical and provable watermarking performance of FedGMark.

FedGMKD: An Efficient Prototype Federated Learning Framework through Knowledge Distillation and Differential Aggregation
In the realm of federated learning (FL), addressing the challenge of data heterogeneity across distributed clients is paramount for effective and equitable model training. We propose FedGMKD, a pioneering algorithm designed to navigate the complexities of diverse data landscapes. FedGMKD introduces 'Cluster Knowledge Fusion' (CKF), which integrates mixed Gaussian clustering with knowledge distillation to enable robust local model training without the need for public datasets and server-side generative models. Moreover, a new Differential Aggregation Technique (DAT) is introduced to tailor the aggregation process to the distinct feature distributions of each category, optimizing efficiency and performance. This strategic approach enhances convergence and significantly improves both personalized and global model performance in varied data environments. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FedGMKD marks a crucial advancement in personalized federated learning, achieving state-of-the-art results in heterogeneous data scenarios.

FedSSP: Federated Graph Learning with Spectral Knowledge and Personalized Preference
Personalized Federated Graph Learning (pFGL) facilitates the decentralized training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) without compromising privacy while accommodating personalized requirements for non-IID participants. In cross-domain scenarios, the presence of structural heterogeneity poses significant challenges for pFGL. Nevertheless, previous pFGL methods incorrectly share non-generic knowledge globally and fail to tailor personalized solutions locally under domain structural shift. We innovatively reveal that inherent domain structural shift can be well reflected by the spectral nature of graphs. Correspondingly, our method overcomes it by sharing generic spectral knowledge. Moreover, we indicate the biased message-passing schemes for graph structures and propose the personalized preference module. Combining both strategies for effective global collaboration and personalized local application, we propose our pFGL framework FedSSP and further perform extensive experiments on cross-dataset and cross-domain settings to demonstrate the superiority of FedSSP.

FEEL-SNN: Robust Spiking Neural Networks with Frequency Encoding and Evolutionary Leak Factor
Currently, researchers think that the inherent robustness of spiking neural networks (SNNs) stems from their biologically plausible spiking neurons, and are dedicated to developing more bio-inspired models to defend attacks. However, most work relies solely on experimental analysis and lacks theoretical support, and the direct-encoding method and fixed membrane potential leak factor they used in spiking neurons are simplified simulations of those in the biological nervous system, which makes it difficult to ensure generalizability across all datasets and networks. Contrarily, the biological nervous system can stay reliable even in a highly complex noise environment, one of the reasons is selective visual attention and non-fixed membrane potential leaks in biological neurons.  This biological finding has inspired us to design a highly robust SNN model that closely mimics the biological nervous system. In our study, we first present a unified theoretical framework for SNN robustness constraint, which suggests that improving the encoding method and evolution of the membrane potential leak factor in spiking neurons can improve SNN robustness. Subsequently, we propose a robust SNN (FEEL-SNN) with Frequency Encoding (FE) and Evolutionary Leak factor (EL) to defend against different noises, mimicking the selective visual attention mechanism and non-fixed leak observed in biological systems.  Experimental results confirm the efficacy of both our FE and FEEL methods, either in isolation or in conjunction with established robust enhancement algorithms, for enhancing the robustness of SNNs. Our code is available in supplementary material.

Few-Shot Diffusion Models Escape the Curse of Dimensionality
While diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance, there is a growing need for generating samples tailored to specific user-defined concepts. The customized requirements promote the development of few-shot diffusion models, which use limited $n_{ta}$ target samples to fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model trained on $n_s$ source samples. Despite the empirical success, no theoretical work specifically analyzes few-shot diffusion models. Moreover, the existing results for diffusion models without a fine-tuning phase can not explain why few-shot models generate great samples due to the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we analyze few-shot diffusion models under a linear structure distribution with a latent dimension $d$. From the approximation perspective, we prove that few-shot models have a $\widetilde{O}(n_s^{-2/d}+n_{ta}^{-1/2})$ bound to approximate the target score function, which is better than $n_{ta}^{-2/d}$ results. From the optimization perspective, we consider a latent Gaussian special case and prove that the optimization problem has a closed-form minimizer. This means few-shot models can directly obtain an approximated minimizer without a complex optimization process. Furthermore, we also provide the accuracy bound $\widetilde{O}(1/n_{ta}+1/\sqrt{n_s})$ for the empirical solution, which still has better dependence on $n_{ta}$ compared to $n_s$. The results of the real-world experiments also show that the models obtained by only fine-tuning the encoder and decoder specific to the target distribution can produce novel images with the target feature, which supports our theoretical results.

FIFO-Diffusion: Generating Infinite Videos from Text without Training
We propose a novel inference technique based on a pretrained diffusion model for text-conditional video generation. Our approach, called FIFO-Diffusion, is conceptually capable of generating infinitely long videos without additional training. This is achieved by iteratively performing diagonal denoising, which concurrently processes a series of consecutive frames with increasing noise levels in a queue; our method dequeues a fully denoised frame at the head while enqueuing a new random noise frame at the tail. However, diagonal denoising is a double-edged sword as the frames near the tail can take advantage of cleaner ones by forward reference but such a strategy induces the discrepancy between training and inference. Hence, we introduce latent partitioning to reduce the training-inference gap and lookahead denoising to leverage the benefit of forward referencing. Practically, FIFO-Diffusion consumes a constant amount of memory regardless of the target video length given a baseline model, while well-suited for parallel inference on multiple GPUs. We have demonstrated the promising results and effectiveness of the proposed methods on existing text-to-video generation baselines. Generated video samples are available on our project page.

FilterNet: Harnessing Frequency Filters for Time Series Forecasting
Given the ubiquitous presence of time series data across various domains, precise forecasting of time series holds significant importance and finds widespread real-world applications such as energy, weather, healthcare, etc. While numerous forecasters have been proposed using different network architectures, the Transformer-based models have state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting. However, forecasters based on Transformers are still suffering from vulnerability to high-frequency signals, efficiency in computation, and bottleneck in full-spectrum utilization, which essentially are the cornerstones for accurately predicting time series with thousands of points. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective of enlightening signal processing for deep time series forecasting. Inspired by the filtering process, we introduce one simple yet effective network, namely FilterNet, built upon our proposed learnable frequency filters to extract key informative temporal patterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time series signals. Concretely, we propose two kinds of learnable filters in the FilterNet: (i) Plain shaping filter, that adopts a universal frequency kernel for signal filtering and temporal modeling; (ii) Contextual shaping filter, that utilizes filtered frequencies examined in terms of its compatibility with input signals for dependency learning. Equipped with the two filters, FilterNet can approximately surrogate the linear and attention mappings widely adopted in time series literature, while enjoying superb abilities in handling high-frequency noises and utilizing the whole frequency spectrum that is beneficial for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks, and experimental results have demonstrated our superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods.

FINALLY: fast and universal speech enhancement with studio-like quality
In this paper, we address the challenge of speech enhancement in real-world recordings, which often contain various forms of distortion, such as background noise, reverberation, and microphone artifacts.We revisit the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for speech enhancement and theoretically show that GANs are naturally inclined to seek the point of maximum density within the conditional clean speech distribution, which, as we argue, is essential for speech enhancement task.We study various feature extractors for perceptual loss to facilitate the stability of adversarial training, developing a methodology for probing the structure of the feature space.This leads us to integrate WavLM-based perceptual loss into MS-STFT adversarial training pipeline, creating an effective and stable training procedure for the speech enhancement model.The resulting speech enhancement model, which we refer to as FINALLY, builds upon the HiFi++ architecture, augmented with a WavLM encoder and a novel training pipeline.Empirical results on various datasets confirm our model's ability to produce clear, high-quality speech at 48 kHz, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of speech enhancement.

Finding good policies in average-reward Markov Decision Processes without prior knowledge
We revisit the identification of an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDP). In such MDPs, two measures of complexity have appeared in the literature: the diameter, $D$, and the optimal bias span, $H$, which satisfy $H\leq D$.  Prior work have studied the complexity of $\varepsilon$-optimal policy identification only when a generative model is available. In this case, it is known that there exists an MDP with $D \simeq H$ for which the sample complexity to output an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy is $\Omega(SAD/\varepsilon^2)$ where $S$ and $A$ are the sizes of the state and action spaces. Recently, an algorithm with a sample complexity of order $SAH/\varepsilon^2$ has been proposed, but it requires the knowledge of $H$. We first show that the sample complexity required to estimate $H$ is not bounded by any function of $S,A$ and $H$, ruling out the possibility to easily make the previous algorithm agnostic to $H$. By relying instead on a diameter estimation procedure, we propose the first algorithm for $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PAC policy identification that does not need any form of prior knowledge on the MDP. Its sample complexity scales in $SAD/\varepsilon^2$ in the regime of small $\varepsilon$, which is near-optimal. In the online setting, our first contribution is a lower bound which implies that a sample complexity polynomial in $H$ cannot be achieved in this setting. Then, we propose an online algorithm with a sample complexity in $SAD^2/\varepsilon^2$, as well as a novel approach based on a data-dependent stopping rule that we believe is promising to further reduce this bound.

Finding NeMo: Localizing Neurons Responsible For Memorization in Diffusion Models
Diffusion models (DMs) produce very detailed and high-quality images. Their power results from extensive training on large amounts of data - usually scraped from the internet without proper attribution or consent from content creators. Unfortunately, this practice raises privacy and intellectual property concerns, as DMs can memorize and later reproduce their potentially sensitive or copyrighted training images at inference time. Prior efforts prevent this issue by either changing the input to the diffusion process, thereby preventing the DM from generating memorized samples during inference, or removing the memorized data from training altogether. While those are viable solutions when the DM is developed and deployed in a secure and constantly monitored environment, they hold the risk of adversaries circumventing the safeguards and are not effective when the DM itself is publicly released. To solve the problem, we introduce NeMo, the first method to localize memorization of individual data samples down to the level of neurons in DMs' cross-attention layers. Through our experiments, we make the intriguing finding that in many cases, single neurons are responsible for memorizing particular training samples. By deactivating these memorization neurons, we can avoid the replication of training data at inference time, increase the diversity in the generated outputs, and mitigate the leakage of private and copyrighted data. In this way, our NeMo contributes to a more responsible deployment of DMs.

Finding Transformer Circuits With Edge Pruning
The path to interpreting a language model often proceeds via analysis of circuits---sparse computational subgraphs of the model that capture specific aspects of its behavior. Recent work has automated the task of discovering circuits. Yet, these methods have practical limitations, as they either rely on inefficient search algorithms or inaccurate approximations. In this paper, we frame circuit discovery as an optimization problem and propose _Edge Pruning_ as an effective and scalable solution. Edge Pruning leverages gradient-based pruning techniques, but instead of removing neurons or components, prunes the _edges_ between components. Our method finds circuits in GPT-2 that use less than half the number of edges than circuits found by previous methods while being equally faithful to the full model predictions on standard circuit-finding tasks. Edge Pruning is efficient on tasks involving up to 100,000 examples, outperforming previous methods in speed and producing substantially better circuits. It also perfectly recovers the ground-truth circuits in two models compiled with Tracr. Thanks to its efficiency, we scale Edge Pruning to CodeLlama-13B, a model over 100x the size of GPT-2.We use this setting for a case study, where we compare the mechanisms behind instruction prompting and in-context learning.We find two circuits with more than 99.96% sparsity that match the performance of the full model. Further analysis reveals that the mechanisms in the two settings overlap substantially. This shows that Edge Pruning is a practical and scalable tool for interpretability, which can shed light on behaviors that only emerge in large models.

FineCLIP: Self-distilled Region-based CLIP for Better Fine-Grained Understanding
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) achieves impressive performance on tasks like image classification and image-text retrieval by learning on large-scale image-text datasets. However, CLIP struggles with dense prediction tasks due to the poor grasp of the fine-grained details. Although existing works pay attention to this issue, they achieve limited improvements and usually sacrifice the important visual-semantic consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose FineCLIP, which keeps the global contrastive learning to preserve the visual-semantic consistency and further enhances the fine-grained understanding through two innovations: 1) A real-time self-distillation scheme that facilitates the transfer of representation capability from global to local features. 2) A semantically-rich regional contrastive learning paradigm with generated region-text pairs, boosting the local representation capabilities with abundant fine-grained knowledge. Both cooperate to fully leverage diverse semantics and multi-grained complementary information.To validate the superiority of our FineCLIP and the rationality of each design, we conduct extensive experiments on challenging dense prediction and image-level tasks. All the observations demonstrate the effectiveness of FineCLIP.

Fine-grained Analysis of In-context Linear Estimation
Recent research has shown that Transformers with linear attention are capable of in-context learning (ICL) by implementing a linear estimator through gradient descent steps. However, the existing results on the optimization landscape apply under stylized settings where task and feature vectors are assumed to be IID and the attention weights are fully parameterized. In this work, we develop a stronger characterization of the optimization and generalization landscape of ICL through contributions on architectures, low-rank parameterization, and correlated designs: (1) We study the landscape of 1-layer linear attention and 1-layer H3, a state-space model. Under a suitable correlated design assumption, we prove that both implement 1-step preconditioned gradient descent. We show that thanks to its native convolution filters, H3 also has the advantage of implementing sample weighting and outperforming linear attention in suitable settings. (2) By studying correlated designs, we provide new risk bounds for retrieval augmented generation which reveal how ICL sample complexity significantly benefits from distributional alignment. (3) We derive the optimal risk for low-rank parameterized attention weights in terms of covariance spectrum. Through this, we also shed light on how LoRA can adapt to a new distribution by capturing the shift between task covariances. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings. Overall, this work explores the optimization and risk landscape of ICL in practically meaningful settings and contributes to a more thorough understanding of its mechanics.

Fine-grained Control of Generative Data Augmentation in IoT Sensing
Internet of Things (IoT) sensing models often suffer from overfitting due to data distribution shifts between training dataset and real-world scenarios. To address this, data augmentation techniques have been adopted to enhance model robustness by bolstering the diversity of synthetic samples within a defined vicinity of existing samples. This paper introduces a novel paradigm of data augmentation for IoT sensing signals by adding fine-grained control to generative models. We define a metric space with statistical metrics that capture the essential features of the short-time Fourier Transformed (STFT) spectrograms of IoT sensing signals. These metrics serve as strong conditions for a generative model, enabling us to tailor the spectrogram characteristics in the time-frequency domain according to specific application needs. Furthermore, we propose a set of data augmentation techniques within this metric space to create new data samples. Our method is evaluated across various generative models, datasets, and downstream IoT sensing models. The results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the conventional transformation-based data augmentation techniques and prior generative data augmentation models.

Fine-Grained Dynamic Framework for Bias-Variance Joint Optimization on Data Missing Not at Random
In most practical applications such as recommendation systems, display advertising, and so forth, the collected data often contains missing values and those missing values are generally missing-not-at-random, which deteriorates the prediction performance of models. Some existing estimators and regularizers attempt to achieve unbiased estimation to improve the predictive performance. However, variances and generalization bound of these methods are generally unbounded when the propensity scores tend to zero, compromising their stability and robustness. In this paper, we first theoretically reveal that limitations of regularization techniques. Besides, we further illustrate that, for more general estimators, unbiasedness will inevitably lead to unbounded variance. These general laws inspire us that the estimator designs is not merely about eliminating bias, reducing variance, or simply achieve a bias-variance trade-off. Instead, it involves a quantitative joint optimization of bias and variance. Then, we develop a systematic fine-grained dynamic learning framework to jointly optimize bias and variance, which adaptively selects an appropriate estimator for each user-item pair according to the predefined objective function. With this operation, the generalization bounds and variances of models are reduced and bounded with theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic learning framework.

Fine-grained Image-to-LiDAR Contrastive Distillation with Visual Foundation Models
Contrastive image-to-LiDAR knowledge transfer, commonly used for learning 3D representations with synchronized images and point clouds, often faces a self-conflict dilemma. This issue arises as contrastive losses unintentionally dissociate features of unmatched points and pixels that share semantic labels, compromising the integrity of learned representations. To overcome this, we harness Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which have revolutionized the acquisition of pixel-level semantics, to enhance 3D representation learning. Specifically, we utilize off-the-shelf VFMs to generate semantic labels for weakly-supervised pixel-to-point contrastive distillation. Additionally, we employ von Mises-Fisher distributions to structure the feature space, ensuring semantic embeddings within the same class remain consistent across varying inputs. Furthermore, we adapt sampling probabilities of points to address imbalances in spatial distribution and category frequency, promoting comprehensive and balanced learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach mitigates the challenges posed by traditional methods and consistently surpasses existing image-to-LiDAR contrastive distillation methods in downstream tasks. We have included the code in supplementary materials.

Fine-Tuning is Fine, if Calibrated
Fine-tuning is arguably the most straightforward way to tailor a pre-trained model (e.g., a foundation model) to downstream applications, but it also comes with the risk of losing valuable knowledge the model had learned in pre-training. For example, fine-tuning a pre-trained classifier capable of recognizing a large number of classes to master a subset of classes at hand is shown to drastically degrade the model's accuracy in the other classes it had previously learned. As such, it is hard to further use the fine-tuned model when it encounters classes beyond the fine-tuning data. In this paper, we systematically dissect the issue, aiming to answer the fundamental question, "What has been damaged in the fine-tuned model?" To our surprise, we find that the fine-tuned model neither forgets the relationship among the other classes nor degrades the features to recognize these classes. Instead, the fine-tuned model often produces more discriminative features for these other classes, even if they were missing during fine-tuning! What really hurts the accuracy is the discrepant logit scales between the fine-tuning classes and the other classes, implying that a simple post-processing calibration would bring back the pre-trained model's capability and at the same time unveil the feature improvement over all classes. We conduct an extensive empirical study to demonstrate the robustness of our findings and provide preliminary explanations underlying them, suggesting new directions for future theoretical analysis.

First-Order Minimax Bilevel Optimization
Multi-block minimax bilevel optimization has been studied recently due to its great potential in multi-task learning, robust machine learning, and few-shot learning. However, due to the complex three-level optimization structure, existing algorithms often suffer from issues such as high computing costs due to the second-order model derivatives or high memory consumption in storing all blocks' parameters. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing two novel fully first-order algorithms named FOSL and MemCS. FOSL features a fully single-loop structure by updating all three variables simultaneously, and MemCS is a memory-efficient double-loop algorithm with cold-start initialization. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis for both algorithms under full and partial block participation, and show that their sample complexities match or outperform those of the same type of methods in standard bilevel optimization. We evaluate our methods in two applications: the recently proposed multi-task deep AUC maximization and a novel rank-based robust meta-learning. Our methods consistently improve over existing methods with better performance over various datasets.

Fisher Flow Matching for Discrete Data
Generative modeling over discrete data has recently seen numerous success stories, with applications spanning language modeling, biological sequence design, and graph-structured molecular data. The predominant generative modeling paradigm for discrete data is still autoregressive, with more recent alternatives based on diffusion or flow-matching falling short of their impressive performance in continuous data settings, such as image or video generation. In this work, we introduce Fisher-Flow, a novel flow-matching model for discrete data. Fisher-Flow takes a manifestly geometric perspectiveby considering categorical distributions over discrete data as points residing on a statistical manifold equipped with its natural Riemannian metric: the \emph{Fisher-Rao metric}. As a result, we demonstrate discrete data itself can be continuously reparameterised to points on the positive orthant of the $d$-hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^d_+$, which allows us to define flows that map any source distribution to target in a principled manner by transporting mass along (closed-form) geodesics of $\mathbb{S}^d_+$. Furthermore, the learned flows in Fisher-Flow can be further bootstrapped by leveraging Riemannian optimal transport leading to improved training dynamics. We prove that the gradient flow induced by Fisher-FLow is optimal in reducing the forward KL divergence. We evaluate Fisher-Flow on an array of synthetic and diverse real-world benchmarks, including designing DNA Promoter, and DNA Enhancer sequences. Empirically, we find that Fisher-Flow improves over prior diffusion and flow-matching models on these benchmarks.

Fishers and Hessians of Continuous Relaxations
When training neural networks with custom objectives, such as ranking objectives and shortest-path objectives, a common problem is that they, per se, do not have gradients.A popular approach is to continuously relax the objectives in order to provide gradients, enabling learning.However, such continuous relaxations often suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients.In this work, we explore a technique for using the empirical Fisher matrices and Hessians of relaxations to alleviate the training bottleneck that arises from vanishing and exploding gradients in the objective function.We benchmark our approach on four relaxations of ranking and shortest-path objectives each, showing strong improvements particularly for rather `ad-hoc' relaxations that do not come with strong theoretical guarantees.

Fit for our purpose, not yours: Benchmark for a low-resource, Indigenous language
Influential and popular benchmarks in AI are largely irrelevant to developing NLP tools for low-resource, Indigenous languages. With the primary goal of measuring the performance of general-purpose AI systems, these benchmarks fail to give due consideration and care to individual language communities, especially low-resource languages. The datasets contain numerous grammatical and orthographic errors, poor pronunciation, limited vocabulary, and the content lacks cultural relevance to the language community. To overcome the issues with these benchmarks, we have created a dataset for te reo Māori (the Indigenous language of Aotearoa/New Zealand) to pursue NLP tools that are ‘fit-for-our-purpose’. This paper demonstrates how low-resourced, Indigenous languages can develop tailored, high-quality benchmarks that; i. Consider the impact of colonisation on their language; ii. Reflect the diversity of speakers in the language community; iii. Support the aspirations for the tools they are developing and their language revitalisation efforts.

FiVA: Fine-grained Visual Attribute Dataset for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
Recent advances in text-to-image generation have enabled the creation of high-quality images with diverse applications. However, accurately describing desired visual attributes can be challenging, especially for non-experts in art and photography. An intuitive solution involves adopting favorable attributes from source images. Current methods attempt to distill identity and style from source images. However, "style" is a broad concept that includes texture, color, and artistic elements, but does not cover other important attributes like lighting and dynamics. Additionally, a simplified "style" adaptation prevents combining multiple attributes from different sources into one generated image. In this work, we formulate a more effective approach to decompose the aesthetics of a picture into specific visual attributes, letting users apply characteristics like lighting, texture, and dynamics from different images. To achieve this goal, we constructed the first fine-grained visual attributes dataset (FiVA) to the best of our knowledge. This FiVA dataset features a well-organized taxonomy for visual attributes and includes 700K high-quality generated images with visual attribute annotations. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a fine-grained visual attributes adaptation framework (FiVA-Adapter) , which decouples and adapts visual attributes from one or more source images into a generated one. This approach enhances user-friendly customization, allowing users to selectively apply desired attributes to create images that meet their unique preferences and specific content requirements.

(FL)${}^2$: Overcoming Few Labels in Federated Semi-Supervised Learning
Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that trains accurate global models while preserving clients' privacy-sensitive data. However, most FL approaches assume that clients possess labeled data, which is often not the case in practice. Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (FSSL) addresses this label deficiency problem, targeting situations where only the server has a small amount of labeled data while clients do not. Nonetheless, a significant performance gap exists between Centralized Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and FSSL. This gap arises from confirmation bias, which is more pronounced in FSSL due to the multiple local training epochs and the separation of labeled and unlabeled data. We propose (FL)${}^2$, a robust training method for unlabeled clients using sharpness-aware consistency regularization. We discover that regularizing the original pseudo-labeling loss is suboptimal, hence we carefully select unlabeled samples for regularization. We further introduce client-specific adaptive thresholding and learning status-aware aggregation to adjust the training process based on the learning progress of each client. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves performance and bridges the gap with SSL, particularly in scenarios with scarce labeled data.

Flaws can be Applause: Unleashing Potential of Segmenting Ambiguous Objects in SAM
As the vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrate potent universality, they also present challenges in giving ambiguous and uncertain predictions. Significant variations in the model's output and granularity can occur with simply subtle changes in the prompt, contradicting the consensus requirement for the robustness for a model. While some established work have been dedicated to stabilize and fortify the prediction of SAM, this paper takes a unique path to explore how this flaw can be inverted into an advantage when modeling inherently ambiguous data distributions. We introduce an optimization framework based on a conditional variational autoencoder, which jointly models the prompt and the granularity of the object with a latent probability distribution. This approach enables the model adaptively perceiving and representing the real ambiguous label distribution, taming SAM to produce a series of diverse, convincing, and reasonable segmentation outputs controllably. Extensive experiments on several practical deployment scenarios involving ambiguity demonstrates the exceptional performance of our framework.

Flexible mapping of abstract domains by grid cells via self-supervised extraction and projection of generalized velocity signals
Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex create remarkable periodic maps of explored space during navigation. Recent studies show that they form similar maps of abstract cognitive spaces. Examples of such abstract environments include auditory tone sequences in which the pitch is continuously varied or images in which abstract features are continuously deformed (e.g., a cartoon bird whose legs stretch and shrink). Here we hypothesize that the brain generalizes how it maps spatial domains to mapping abstract spaces by extracting self-consistent and low-dimensional descriptions of displacements through these abstract spaces, and then leveraging the spatial velocity integration capability of grid cells to efficiently build maps of different domains. Our neural circuit for abstract velocity extraction factorizes the content of these abstract domains from displacements within the domains to generate content-independent and self-consistent low-dimensional velocity estimates. Crucially, it uses a self-supervised geometric consistency constraint that requires displacements along closed loop trajectories to sum to zero, an integration that is itself performed by the downstream grid cell circuit over learning. This process results in high fidelity estimates of velocities and allowed transitions in abstract domains, a crucial prerequisite for efficient map generation in these high-dimensional environments. We also show how our method outperforms traditional dimensionality reduction and deep-learning based motion extraction networks on the same set of tasks. This is the first neural circuit model to explain how grid cells can flexibly represent different abstract spaces and makes the novel prediction that they should do so while maintaining their population correlation and manifold structure across domains. Fundamentally, our model sheds light on the mechanistic origins of cognitive flexibility and transfer of representations across vastly different domains in brains, providing a potential self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for leveraging similar ideas in transfer learning and data-efficient generalization in machine learning and robotics.

Flex-MoE: Addressing Missing Modalities in Alzheimer’s Disease with Flexible Mixture-of-Experts
Recent advancements in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) research, propelled by machine learning innovations, have significantly pushed the frontier of the field. Critically, while multimodal approaches are essential in the AD domain, existing works primarily focus on single modalities such as imaging, genomics, or clinical data. Few recent studies attempt to integrate multiple modalities, and the lack of robust methods to handle missing modalities often limits the usability of such integrative approaches, forcing reliance on samples where the target modalities are available. Addressing this gap, we propose a novel multimodal learning framework, Flex-MoE (Flexible Mixture-of-Experts), which is flexible in incorporating diverse modalities in AD research while being resilient to missing modality scenarios through an advanced Sparse MoE design. The core idea of Flex-MoE is to handle samples with diverse modality combinations by sorting them based on the number of available modalities and passing them through modality-specific encoders. For missing embeddings, a missing modality bank with learnable embeddings is introduced. These embeddings, along with observed modality combinations, are processed through a Transformer with a Sparse MoE layer. Flex-MoE first trains experts with full modality samples to inject generalized knowledge and uses a newly designed S-Router to specialize expert knowledge for fewer modality combinations, fixing the top-1 gate as the corresponding observed modality combination expert. By evaluating Flex-MoE on the gold-standard ADNI dataset in the AD stage prediction task, we demonstrate its effectiveness in handling diverse missing modality scenarios. The source code of this study can be found here: https: //anonymous.4open.science/r/flex-mixture-of-experts-E074/.

Flipped Classroom: Aligning Teacher Attention with Student in Generalized Category Discovery
Recent advancements have shown promise in applying traditional Semi-Supervised Learning strategies to the task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). Typically, this involves a teacher-student framework in which the teacher imparts knowledge to the student to classify categories, even in the absence of explicit labels. Nevertheless, GCD presents unique challenges, particularly the absence of priors for new classes, which can lead to the teacher's misguidance and unsynchronized learning with the student, culminating in suboptimal outcomes. In our work, we delve into why traditional teacher-student designs falter in generalized category discovery as compared to their success in closed-world semi-supervised learning. We identify inconsistent pattern learning as the crux of this issue and introduce FlipClass—a method that dynamically updates the teacher to align with the student's attention, instead of maintaining a static teacher reference. Our teacher-attention-update strategy refines the teacher's focus based on student feedback, promoting consistent pattern recognition and synchronized learning across old and new classes. Extensive experiments on a spectrum of benchmarks affirm that FlipClass significantly surpasses contemporary GCD methods, establishing new standards for the field.

FlowTurbo: Towards Real-time Flow-Based Image Generation with Velocity Refiner
Building on the success of diffusion models in visual generation, flow-based models reemerge as another prominent family of generative models that have achieved competitive or better performance in terms of both visual quality and inference speed. By learning the velocity field through flow-matching, flow-based models tend to produce a straighter sampling trajectory, which is advantageous during the sampling process. However, unlike diffusion models for which fast samplers are well-developed, efficient sampling of flow-based generative models has been rarely explored. In this paper, we propose a framework called FlowTurbo to accelerate the sampling of flow-based models while still enhancing the sampling quality. Our primary observation is that the velocity predictor's outputs in the flow-based models will become stable during the sampling, enabling the estimation of velocity via a lightweight velocity refiner. Additionally, we introduce several techniques including a pseudo corrector and sample-aware compilation to further reduce inference time. Since FlowTurbo does not change the multi-step sampling paradigm, it can be effectively applied for various tasks such as image editing, inpainting, *etc*. By integrating FlowTurbo into different flow-based models, we obtain an acceleration ratio of 53.1\%$\sim$58.3\% on class-conditional generation and 29.8\%$\sim$38.5\% on text-to-image generation. Notably, FlowTurbo reaches an FID of 2.12 on ImageNet with 100 (ms / img) and FID of 3.93 with 38 (ms / img), achieving the real-time image generation and establishing the new state-of-the-art.

F-OAL: Foward-only Online Analytic Learning with Fast Training and Low Memory Footprint in Class Incremental Learning
Online Class Incremental Learning (OCIL) aims to train models incrementally, where data arrive in mini-batches, and previous data are not accessible. A major challenge in OCIL is Catastrophic Forgetting, i.e., the loss of previously learned knowledge. Among existing baselines, replay-based methods show competitive results but compromise data privacy, while exemplar-free methods safeguard privacy but often lack accuracy. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-free approach—Foward-only Online Analytic Learning (F-OAL). Unlike traditional methods, F-OAL does not rely on back-propagation and is forward-only, significantly reducing memory usage and computational time. Cooperating with a pre-trained frozen encoder with feature fusion, F-OAL only needs to update a linear classifier by recursive least square. This approach simultaneously achieves high accuracy, low resource consumption, and data privacy protection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate F-OAL's robust performance in OCIL scenarios.

Forgetting, Ignorance or Myopia: Revisiting Key Challenges in Online Continual Learning
Online continual learning (OCL) requires the models to learn from constant, endless streams of data. While significant efforts have been made in this field, most were focused on mitigating the \textit{catastrophic forgetting} issue to achieve better classification ability, at the cost of a much heavier training workload. They overlooked that in real-world scenarios, e.g., in high-speed data stream environments, data do not pause to accommodate slow models. In this paper, we emphasize that \textit{model throughput}-- defined as the maximum number of training samples that a model can process within a unit of time --  is equally important. It directly limits how much data a model can utilize and presents a challenging dilemma for current methods. With this understanding, we revisit key challenges in OCL from both empirical and theoretical perspectives, highlighting two critical issues beyond the well-documented catastrophic forgetting: (\romannumeral1) Model's ignorance: the single-pass nature of OCL challenges models to learn effective features within constrained training time and storage capacity, leading to a trade-off between effective learning and model throughput; (\romannumeral2) Model's myopia: the local learning nature of OCL on the current task leads the model to adopt overly simplified, task-specific features and \textit{excessively sparse classifier}, resulting in the gap between the optimal solution for the current task and the global objective. To tackle these issues, we propose the Non-sparse Classifier Evolution framework (NsCE) to facilitate effective global discriminative feature learning with minimal time cost. NsCE integrates non-sparse maximum separation regularization and targeted experience replay techniques with the help of pre-trained models, enabling rapid acquisition of new globally discriminative features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the substantial improvements of our framework in performance, throughput and real-world practicality.

Fourier-enhanced Implicit Neural Fusion Network for Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion
Recently, implicit neural representations (INR) have made significant strides in various vision-related domains, providing a novel solution for Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion (MHIF) tasks. However, INR is prone to losing high-frequency information and is confined to the lack of global perceptual capabilities. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Fourier-enhanced Implicit Neural Fusion Network (FeINFN) specifically designed for MHIF task, targeting the following phenomena: The Fourier amplitudes of the HR-HSI latent code and LR-HSI are remarkably similar; however, their phases exhibit different patterns. In FeINFN, we innovatively propose a spatial and frequency implicit fusion function (Spa-Fre IFF), helping INR capture high-frequency information and expanding the receptive field. Besides, a new decoder employing a complex Gabor wavelet activation function, called Spatial-Frequency Interactive Decoder (SFID), is invented to enhance the interaction of INR features. Especially, we further theoretically prove that the Gabor wavelet activation possesses a time-frequency tightness property that favors learning the optimal bandwidths in the decoder. Experiments on two benchmark MHIF datasets verify the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of the proposed method, both visually and quantitatively. Also, ablation studies demonstrate the mentioned contributions. The code will be available after possible acceptance.

FreeSplat: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting Towards Free View Synthesis of Indoor Scenes
Empowering 3D Gaussian Splatting with generalization ability is appealing. However, existing generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are largely confined to narrow-range interpolation between stereo images due to their heavy backbones, thus lacking the ability to accurately localize 3D Gaussian and support free-view synthesis across wide view range. In this paper, we present a novel framework FreeSplat that is capable of reconstructing geometrically consistent 3D scenes from long sequence input towards free-view synthesis.Specifically, we firstly introduce Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation achieved by constructing adaptive cost volumes among nearby views and aggregating features using a multi-scale structure. Subsequently, we present the Pixel-wise Triplet Fusion to eliminate redundancy of 3D Gaussians in overlapping view regions and to aggregate features observed across multiple views. Additionally, we propose a simple but effective free-view training strategy that ensures robust view synthesis across broader view range regardless of the number of views. Our empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art novel view synthesis peformances in both novel view rendered color maps quality and depth maps accuracy across different numbers of input views. We also show that FreeSplat performs inference more efficiently and can effectively reduce redundant Gaussians, offering the possibility of feed-forward large scene reconstruction without depth priors. Our code will be made open-source upon paper acceptance.

FreqMark: Invisible Image Watermarking via Frequency Based Optimization in Latent Space
Invisible watermarking is essential for safeguarding digital content, enabling copyright protection and content authentication. However, existing watermarking methods fall short in robustness against regeneration attacks.In this paper, we propose a novel method called FreqMark that involves unconstrained optimization of the image latent frequency space obtained after VAE encoding. Specifically, FreqMark embeds the watermark by optimizing the latent frequency space of the images and then extracts the watermark through a pre-trained image encoder. This optimization allows a flexible trade-off between image quality with watermark robustness and effectively resists regeneration attacks.Experimental results demonstrate that FreqMark offers significant advantages in image quality and robustness, permits flexible selection of the encoding bit number, and achieves a bit accuracy exceeding 90\% when encoding a 48-bit hidden message under various attack scenarios.

Freya PAGE: First Optimal Time Complexity for Large-Scale Nonconvex Finite-Sum Optimization with Heterogeneous Asynchronous Computations
In practical distributed systems, workers are typically not homogeneous, and due to differences in hardware configurations and network conditions, can have highly varying processing times. We consider smooth nonconvex finite-sum (empirical risk minimization) problems in this setup and introduce a new parallel method, Freya PAGE, designed to handle arbitrarily heterogeneous and asynchronous computations. By being robust to "stragglers" and adaptively ignoring slow computations, Freya PAGE offers significantly improved time complexity guarantees compared to all previous methods, including Asynchronous SGD, Rennala SGD, SPIDER, and PAGE, while requiring weaker assumptions. The algorithm relies on novel generic stochastic gradient collection strategies with theoretical guarantees that can be of interest on their own, and may be used in the design of future optimization methods. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound for smooth nonconvex finite-sum problems in the asynchronous setup, providing a fundamental time complexity limit. This lower bound is tight and demonstrates the optimality of Freya PAGE in the large-scale regime, i.e., when $\sqrt{m} \geq n,$ where $n$ is \# of workers, and $m$ is \# of data samples.

FRIEREN: Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation with Rectified Flow Matching
Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize content-matching audio from silent video, and it remains challenging to build V2A models with high generation quality, efficiency, and visual-audio temporal synchrony. We propose Frieren, a V2A model based on rectified flow matching. Frieren regresses the conditional transport vector field from noise to spectrogram latent with straight paths and conducts sampling by solving ODE, outperforming autoregressive and score-based models in terms of audio quality. By employing a non-autoregressive vector field estimator based on a feed-forward transformer and channel-level cross-modal feature fusion with strong temporal alignment, our model generates audio that is highly synchronized with the input video. Furthermore, through reflow and one-step distillation with guided vector field, our model can generate decent audio in a few, or even only one sampling step. Experiments indicate that Frieren achieves state-of-the-art performance in both generation quality and temporal alignment on VGGSound, with alignment accuracy reaching 97.22%, and 6.2% improvement in inception score over the strong diffusion-based baseline. Audio samples are available at http://frieren-v2a.github.io.

From Causal to Concept-Based Representation Learning
To build intelligent machine learning systems, modern representation learning attempts to recover latent generative factors from data, such as in causal representation learning. A key question in this growing field is to provide rigorous conditions under which latent factors can be identified and thus, potentially learned. Motivated by extensive empirical literature on linear representations and concept learning, we propose to relax causal notions with a geometric notion of concepts. We formally define a notion of concepts and show rigorously that they can be provably recovered from diverse data. Instead of imposing assumptions on the "true" generative latent space, we assume that concepts can be represented linearly in this latent space. The tradeoff is that instead of identifying the "true" generative factors, we identify a subset of desired human-interpretable concepts that are relevant for a given application. Experiments on synthetic data, multimodal CLIP models and large language models supplement our results and show the utility of our approach. In this way, we provide a foundation for moving from causal representations to interpretable, concept-based representations by bringing together ideas from these two neighboring disciplines.

From Chaos to Clarity: 3DGS in the Dark
Novel view synthesis from raw images provides superior high dynamic range (HDR) information compared to reconstructions from low dynamic range RGB images. However, the inherent noise in unprocessed raw images compromises the accuracy of 3D scene representation. Our study reveals that 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is particularly susceptible to this noise, leading to numerous elongated Gaussian shapes that overfit the noise, thereby significantly degrading reconstruction quality and reducing inference speed, especially in scenarios with limited views. To address these issues, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework designed to reconstruct HDR 3DGS from a limited number of noisy raw images. This framework enhances 3DGS by integrating a noise extractor and employing a noise-robust reconstruction loss that leverages a noise distribution prior. Experimental results show that our method outperforms LDR/HDR 3DGS and previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised and supervised pre-trained models in both reconstruction quality and inference speed on the RawNeRF dataset across a broad range of training views. We will release the code upon paper acceptance.

From Dictionary to Tensor: A Scalable Multi-View Subspace Clustering Framework with Triple Information Enhancement
While Tensor-based Multi-view Subspace Clustering (TMSC) has garnered significant attention for its capacity to effectively capture high-order correlations among multiple views, three notable limitations in current TMSC methods necessitate consideration: 1) high computational complexity and reliance on dictionary completeness resulting from using observed data as the dictionary, 2) inaccurate subspace representation stemming from the oversight of local geometric information and 3) under-penalization of noise-related singular values within tensor data caused by treating all singular values equally. To address these limitations, this paper presents a \textbf{S}calable TMSC framework with \textbf{T}riple inf\textbf{O}rmatio\textbf{N} \textbf{E}nhancement (\textbf{STONE}). Notably, an enhanced anchor dictionary learning mechanism has been utilized to recover the low-rank anchor structure, resulting in reduced computational complexity and increased resilience, especially in scenarios with inadequate dictionaries. Additionally, we introduce an anchor hypergraph Laplacian regularizer to preserve the inherent geometry of the data within the subspace representation. Simultaneously, an improved hyperbolic tangent function has been employed as a precise approximation for tensor rank, effectively capturing the significant variations in singular values. Extensive experimentation on a variety of datasets demonstrates that our approach surpasses SOTA methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.

From Trojan Horses to Castle Walls: Unveiling Bilateral Data Poisoning Effects in Diffusion Models
While state-of-the-art diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, concerns regarding their security persist. Earlier research highlighted DMs' vulnerability to data poisoning attacks, but these studies placed stricter requirements than conventional methods like 'BadNets' in image classification. This is because the art necessitates modifications to the diffusion training and sampling procedures. Unlike the prior work, we investigate whether BadNets-like data poisoning methods can directly degrade the generation by DMs. In other words, if only the training dataset is contaminated (without manipulating the diffusion process), how will this affect the performance of learned DMs? In this setting, we uncover bilateral data poisoning effects that not only serve an adversarial purpose (compromising the functionality of DMs) but also offer a defensive advantage (which can be leveraged for defense in classification tasks against poisoning attacks). We show that a BadNets-like data poisoning attack remains effective in DMs for producing incorrect images (misaligned with the intended text conditions). Meanwhile, poisoned DMs exhibit an increased ratio of triggers, a phenomenon we refer to as 'trigger amplification', among the generated images. This insight can be then used to enhance the detection of poisoned training data. In addition, even under a low poisoning ratio, studying the poisoning effects of DMs is also valuable for designing robust image classifiers against such attacks. Last but not least, we establish a meaningful linkage between data poisoning and the phenomenon of data replications by exploring DMs' inherent data memorization tendencies.

FSP-Laplace: Function-Space Priors for the Laplace Approximation in Bayesian Deep Learning
Laplace approximations are popular techniques for endowing deep networks with epistemic uncertainty estimates as they can be applied without altering the predictions of the neural network, and they scale to large models and datasets.While the choice of prior strongly affects the resulting posterior distribution, computational tractability and lack of interpretability of weight space typically limit the Laplace approximation to isotropic Gaussian priors, which are known to cause pathological behavior as depth increases.As a remedy, we directly place a prior on function space.More precisely, since Lebesgue densities do not exist on infinite-dimensional function spaces, we have to recast training as finding the so-called weak mode of the posterior measure under a Gaussian process (GP) prior restricted to the space of functions representable by the neural network.Through the GP prior, one can express structured and interpretable inductive biases, such as regularity or periodicity, directly in function space, while still exploiting the implicit inductive biases that allow deep networks to generalize.After model linearization, the training objective induces a negative log-posterior density to which we apply a Laplace approximation, leveraging highly scalable methods from matrix-free linear algebra.Our method provides improved results where prior knowledge is abundant, e.g., in many scientific inference tasks.At the same time, it stays competitive for black-box regression and classification tasks where neural networks typically excel.

FT-AED: Benchmark Dataset for Early Freeway Traffic Anomalous Event Detection
Early and accurate detection of anomalous events on the freeway, such as accidents, can improve emergency response and clearance. However, existing delays and mistakes from manual crash reporting records make it a difficult problem to solve. Current large-scale freeway traffic datasets are not designed for anomaly detection and ignore these challenges. In this paper, we introduce the first large-scale lane-level freeway traffic dataset for anomaly detection. Our dataset consists of a month of weekday radar detection sensor data collected in 4 lanes along an 18-mile stretch of Interstate 24 heading toward Nashville, TN, comprising over 3.7 million sensor measurements. We also collect official crash reports from the Nashville Traffic Management Center and manually label all other potential anomalies in the dataset. To show the potential for our dataset to be used in future machine learning and traffic research, we benchmark numerous deep learning anomaly detection models on our dataset. We find that unsupervised graph neural network autoencoders are a promising solution for this problem and that ignoring spatial relationships leads to decreased performance. We demonstrate that our methods can reduce reporting delays by over 10 minutes on average while detecting 75% of crashes. Our dataset and all preprocessing code needed to get started are publicly released at https://acoursey3.github.io/ft-aed/ to facilitate future research.

FUG: Feature-Universal Graph Contrastive Pre-training for Graphs with Diverse Node Features
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), known for their effective graph encoding, are extensively used across various fields. Graph self-supervised pre-training, which self-supervisedly trains GNN encoders to generate high-quality graph representations, has garnered widespread attention. However, due to the inherent complex characteristics in graphs, GNNs encoders pre-trained on one dataset struggle to directly adapt to others that has different node feature shapes. This typically necessitates either model rebuilding or data alignment. The former results in non-transferability as each dataset need to rebuild a new model, while the latter brings serious knowledge loss since it forces features into a uniform shape by preprocessing such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To address this challenge, we propose a new Feature-Universal Graph contrastive pre-training strategy (FUG) that naturally avoids the need for model rebuilding and data reshaping. Specifically, inspired by discussions in existing work on the relationship between Contrastive Learning (CL) and PCA, we conduct a theoretical analysis and discover that PCA's optimization objectives is a special case of that in CL. We design an encoder with CL constraints to emulate PCA's generation of basis transformation matrix, which is utilized to losslessly adapt features in different datasets. Furthermore, we introduced a global uniformity constraint to replace negative sampling, reducing the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, and by explicitly defining positive samples, FUG avoids the substantial memory requirements of data augmentation. In cross domain experiments, FUG has performances close to the re-trained new models.

Full-Atom Peptide Design with Geometric Latent Diffusion
Peptide design plays a pivotal role in therapeutics, allowing brand new possibility to leverage target binding sites that are previously undruggable. Most existing methods are either inefficient or only concerned with the target-agnostic design of 1D sequences. In this paper, we propose a generative model for full-atom Peptide design with Geometric LAtent Diffusion (PepGLAD). We first establish a benchmark consisting of both 1D sequences and 3D structures from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and literature for systematic evaluation. We then identify two major challenges of leveraging current diffusion-based models for peptide design: the full-atom geometry and the variable binding geometry. To tackle the first challenge, PepGLAD derives a variational autoencoder that first encodes full-atom residues of variable size into fixed-dimensional latent representations, and then decodes back to the residue space after conducting the diffusion process in the latent space. For the second issue, PepGLAD explores a receptor-specific affine transformation to convert the 3D coordinates into a shared standard space, enabling better generalization ability across different binding shapes. Experimental Results show that our method not only improves diversity and binding affinity significantly in the task of sequence-structure co-design, but also excels at recovering reference structures for binding conformation generation.

Fully First-Order Methods for Linearly Constrained Bilevel Optimization
Algorithms for bilevel optimization often encounter Hessian computations, which are prohibitive in high dimensions. While recent works offer first-order methods for unconstrained bilevel problems, the \textit{constrained} setting remains relatively underexplored. We present fully first-order linearly constrained optimization methods with finite-time hypergradient stationarity guarantees. For linear \textit{equality} constraints, we attain $\epsilon$-stationarity in $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ gradient oracle calls, which is nearly-optimal. For linear \textit{inequality} constraints, we attain $(\delta,\epsilon)$-Goldstein stationarity in $\widetilde{O}({\delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-4}})$ or $\widetilde{O}(d{\delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-3}})$ gradient oracle calls, where $d$ is the upper-level dimension. Along the way, we develop new nonsmooth nonconvex optimization methods with inexact oracles. Our numerical experiments verify these guarantees.

Functional Gradient Flows for Constrained Sampling
Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called *constrained functional gradient flow* (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Fundamental Convergence Analysis of Sharpness-Aware Minimization
The paper investigates the fundamental convergence properties of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), a recently proposed gradient-based optimization method (Foret et al., 2021) that significantly improves the generalization of deep neural networks. The convergence properties including the stationarity of accumulation points, the convergence of the sequence of gradients to the origin, the sequence of function values to the optimal value, and the sequence of iterates to the optimal solution are established for the method. The universality of the provided convergence analysis based on inexact gradient descent frameworks (Khanh et al., 2023b) allows its extensions to the normalized versions of SAM such as F-SAM (Li et al. 2024), VaSSO (Li & Giannakis, 2023), RSAM (Liu et al., 2022), and to the unnormalized versions of SAM such as USAM (Andriushchenko & Flammarion, 2022). Numerical experiments are conducted on classification tasks using deep learning models to confirm the practical aspects of our analysis.

FUNGI: Features From Unsupervised Gradients
This paper introduces FUNGI: Features from UNsupervised GradIents, a method to enhance the features of vision transformers by leveraging self-supervised gradients. Our method is simple: given a pretrained model, we first compute gradients from various self-supervised objectives for each input. These are projected to a lower dimension and then concatenated with the model's embedding. We evaluate our method on k-nearest neighbor classification over 11 datasets from vision and 5 datasets from NLP. Across backbones spanning various sizes and pretraining strategies, FUNGI features provide consistent performance improvements over the embeddings. We also demonstrate that our method can be used to significantly improve the retrieval-based in-context scene understanding abilities of pretrained models, e.g. for semantic segmentation using a memory bank of $1024 \times 10^2$ patches, we improve upon DINO ViT-B/16 by +17% -- without any training.

FuseAnyPart: Diffusion-Driven Facial Parts Swapping via Multiple Reference Images
Facial parts swapping aims to selectively transfer interest regions from the source image onto the target image while maintaining the rest of the target image unchanged.Most studies on face swapping designed specifically for full-face swapping, are either unable or significantly limited when it comes to swapping individual facial parts, which affects fine-grained and customized character designs.However, designing such an approach specifically for face parts swapping is challenged by a rational multiple reference feature fusion, which needs to be both efficient and effective.To overcome this challenge, FuseAnyPart is proposed to facilitate the seamless ``fuse-any-part" customization of the face.In FuseAnyPart, organ parts from different people are assembled into a complete face in the latent space within the Mask-based Fusion Module.Subsequently, the consolidated feature is dispatched to the Addition-based Injection Module forfusion within the UNet of the diffusion model to create novel characters.Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively validate the superiority and robustness of FuseAnyPart.

G2D: From Global to Dense Radiography Representation Learning via Vision-Language Pre-training
Medical imaging tasks require an understanding of subtle and localized visual features due to the inherently detailed and area-specific nature of pathological patterns, which are crucial for clinical diagnosis. Although recent advances in medical vision-language pre-training (VLP) enable models to learn clinically relevant visual features by leveraging both medical images and their associated radiology reports, current medical VLP methods primarily focus on aligning images with entire reports. This focus hinders the learning of dense (pixel-level) visual features and is suboptimal for dense prediction tasks (e.g., medical image segmentation).To address this challenge, we propose a novel medical VLP framework, named **Global to Dense level representation learning (G2D)**, which aims to learn global and dense visual features simultaneously using only image-text pairs without extra annotations. In particular, G2D designs a **Pseudo Segmentation (PS)** task, which enables the model to learn dense visual features during VLP. Notably, generating PS masks can be performed on the fly during VLP, which does not incur extra trainable parameters. With this simple yet effective idea, G2D achieves superior performance across 5 medical imaging tasks and 25 diseases. Particularly, in the segmentation task which requires dense visual features, **G2D surpasses existing models even with just 1% of the training data for finetuning, compared to 100% used by other models**. The code will be released upon acceptance.

G3: An Effective and Adaptive Framework for Worldwide Geolocalization Using Large Multi-Modality Models
Worldwide geolocalization aims to locate the precise location at the coordinate level of photos taken anywhere on the Earth. It is very challenging due to 1) the difficulty of capturing subtle location-aware visual semantics, and 2) the heterogeneous geographical distribution of image data. As a result, existing studies have clear limitations when scaled to a worldwide context. They may easily confuse distant images with similar visual contents, or cannot adapt to various locations worldwide with different amounts of relevant data. To resolve these limitations, we propose **G3**, a novel framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In particular, G3 consists of three steps, i.e., **G**eo-alignment, **G**eo-diversification, and **G**eo-verification to optimize both retrieval and generation phases of worldwide geolocalization. During Geo-alignment, our solution jointly learns expressive multi-modal representations for images, GPS and textual descriptions, which allows us to capture location-aware semantics for retrieving nearby images for a given query. During Geo-diversification, we leverage a prompt ensembling method that is robust to inconsistent retrieval performance for different image queries. Finally, we combine both retrieved and generated GPS candidates in Geo-verification for location prediction. Experiments on two well-established datasets IM2GPS3k and YFCC4k verify the superiority of G3 compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available online [https://anonymous.4open.science/r/G3-937C](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/G3-937C) for reproduction.

GACL: Exemplar-Free Generalized Analytic Continual Learning
Class incremental learning (CIL) trains a network on sequential tasks with separated categories in each task but suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models quickly lose previously learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. The generalized CIL (GCIL) aims to address the CIL problem in a more real-world scenario, where incoming data have mixed data categories and unknown sample size distribution. Existing attempts for the GCIL either have poor performance or invade data privacy by saving exemplars. In this paper, we propose a new exemplar-free GCIL technique named generalized analytic continual learning (GACL). The GACL adopts analytic learning (a gradient-free training technique), and delivers an analytical  (i.e., closed-form) solution to the GCIL scenario. This solution is derived via decomposing the incoming data into exposed and unexposed classes, thereby attaining a weight-invariant property, a rare yet valuable property supporting an equivalence between the incremental learning and its joint training. Such an equivalence is crucial in GCIL settings as data distributions among different tasks no longer pose challenges adopting our GACL. Theoretically, this property of equivalence is validated through matrix analysis tools. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments, where, compared with existing GCIL methods, our GACL exhibits a consistently leading performance across various datasets and GCIL settings.

GaussianCube: A Structured and Explicit Radiance Representation for 3D Generative Modeling
We introduce a radiance representation that is both structured and fully explicit and thus greatly facilitates 3D generative modeling. Existing radiance representations either require an implicit feature decoder, which significantly degrades the modeling power of the representation, or are spatially unstructured, making them difficult to integrate with mainstream 3D diffusion methods. We derive GaussianCube by first using a novel densification-constrained Gaussian fitting algorithm, which yields high-accuracy fitting using a fixed number of free Gaussians, and then rearranging these Gaussians into a predefined voxel grid via Optimal Transport. Since GaussianCube is a structured grid representation, it allows us to use standard 3D U-Net as our backbone in diffusion modeling without elaborate designs. More importantly, the high-accuracy fitting of the Gaussians allows us to achieve a high-quality representation with orders of magnitude fewer parameters than previous structured representations for comparable quality, ranging from one to two orders of magnitude. The compactness of GaussianCube greatly eases the difficulty of 3D generative modeling. Extensive experiments conducted on unconditional and class-conditioned object generation, digital avatar creation, and text-to-3D synthesis all show that our model achieves state-of-the-art generation results both qualitatively and quantitatively, underscoring the potential of GaussianCube as a highly accurate and versatile radiance representation for 3D generative modeling.

GC-Bench: An Open and Unified Benchmark for Graph Condensation
Graph condensation (GC) has recently garnered considerable attention due to its ability to reduce large-scale graph datasets while preserving their essential properties. The core concept of GC is to create a smaller, more manageable graph that retains the characteristics of the original graph. Despite the proliferation of graph condensation methods developed in recent years, there is no comprehensive evaluation and in-depth analysis, which creates a great obstacle to understanding the progress in this field. To fill this gap, we develop a comprehensive Graph Condensation Benchmark (GC-Bench) to analyze the performance of graph condensation in different scenarios systematically. Specifically, GC-Bench systematically investigates the characteristics of graph condensation in terms of the following dimensions: effectiveness, transferability, and complexity. We comprehensively evaluate 12 state-of-the-art graph condensation algorithms in node-level and graph-level tasks and analyze their performance in 12 diverse graph datasets. Further, we have developed an easy-to-use library for training and evaluating different GC methods to facilitate reproducible research.The GC-Bench library is available at https://github.com/RingBDStack/GC-Bench.

GDeR: Safeguarding Efficiency, Balancing, and Robustness via Prototypical Graph Pruning
Training high-quality deep models necessitates vast amounts of data, resulting in overwhelming computational and memory demands. Recently, data pruning, distillation, and coreset selection have been developed to streamline data volume by \textit{retaining}, \textit{synthesizing}, or \textit{selecting} a small yet informative subset from the full set. Among these methods, data pruning incurs the least additional training cost and offers the most practical acceleration benefits. However, it is the most vulnerable, often suffering significant performance degradation with imbalanced or biased data schema, thus raising concerns about its accuracy and reliability in on-device deployment. Therefore, there is a looming need for a new data pruning paradigm that maintains the efficiency of previous practices while ensuring balance and robustness.Unlike the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, where mature solutions have been developed to address these issues, graph neural networks (GNNs) continue to struggle with increasingly large-scale, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, lacking a unified dataset pruning solution. To achieve this, we introduce a novel dynamic soft-pruning method, \ourmethod, designed to update the training ``basket'' during the process using trainable prototypes. \ourmethod first constructs a well-modeled graph embedding hypersphere and then samples \textit{representative, balanced, and unbiased subsets} from this embedding space, which achieves the goal we called {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont \textbf{Graph Training Debugging}}.Extensive experiments on four datasets across three GNN backbones, demonstrate that \ourmethod (I) achieves or surpasses the performance of the full dataset with $30\%\sim50\%$ fewer training samples, (II) attains up to a $2.81\times$ lossless training speedup, and (III) outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in imbalanced training and noisy training scenarios by $0.3\%\sim4.3\%$ and $3.6\%\sim7.8\%$, respectively.

Gene-Gene Relationship Modeling Based on Genetic Evidence for Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Imputation
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the exploration of cellular heterogeneity and facilitate the construction of cell atlases. However, scRNA-seq data often contain a large portion of missing values (false zeros) or noisy values, hindering downstream analyses. To recover these false zeros, propagation-based imputation methods have been proposed using $k$-NN graphs. However they model only associating relationships among genes within a cell, while, according to well-known genetic evidence, there are both associating and dissociating relationships among genes. To apply this genetic evidence to gene-gene relationship modeling, this paper proposes a novel imputation method that newly employs dissociating relationships in addition to associating relationships. Our method constructs a $k$-NN graph to additionally model dissociating relationships via the negation of a given cell-gene matrix. Moreover, our method standardizes the value distribution (mean and variance) of each gene to have standard distributions regardless of the gene. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves exceptional performance gains over state-of-the-art methods in both cell clustering and gene expression recovery across six scRNA-seq datasets, validating the significance of using complete gene-gene relationships in accordance with genetic evidence.

General bounds on the quality of Bayesian coresets
Bayesian coresets speed up posterior inference in the large-scale data regime by approximating the full-data log-likelihood function with a surrogate log-likelihood based on a small, weighted subset of the data. But while Bayesian coresets and methods for construction are applicable in a wide range of models, existing theoretical analysis of the posterior inferential error incurred by coreset approximations only apply in restrictive settings---i.e., exponential family models, or models with strong log-concavity and smoothness assumptions. This work presents general upper and lower bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of coreset approximations that reflect the full range of applicability of Bayesian coresets. The lower bounds require only mild model assumptions typical of Bayesian asymptotic analyses, while the upper bounds require the log-likelihood functions to satisfy a generalized subexponentiality criterion that is weaker than conditions used in earlier work. The lower bounds are applied to obtain fundamental limitations on the quality of coreset approximations, and to provide a theoretical explanation for the previously-observed poor empirical performance of importance sampling-based construction methods. The upper bounds are used to analyze the performance of recent subsample-optimize methods. The flexibility of the theory is demonstrated in validation experiments involving multimodal, unidentifiable, heavy-tailed Bayesian posterior distributions.

General Detection-based Text Line Recognition
We introduces a general detection-based approach to text line recognition, be it printed (OCR) or handwritten text (HTR), with latin, chinese or ciphered characters. Detection based approaches have until now largely been discarded for HTR because reading characters separately is often challenging, and character-level annotation is difficult and expensive. We overcome these challenges thanks to three main insights: (i) synthetic pre-training with diverse enough data enables to learn reasonable characters localization in any script; (ii) modern transformer-based detectors can jointly detect a large number of instances and, if trained with an adequate masking strategy, leverage consistency between the different detections; (iii) once a pre-trained detection model with approximate character localization is available, it is possible to fine-tune it with line-level annotation on real data, even with a different alphabet.  Our approach thus builds on a completely different paradigm than most state-of-the-art methods, which rely on autoregressive decoding, predicting character values one by one, while we treat a complete line in parallel. Remarkably, our method demonstrates good performance on range of scripts, usually tackled with specialized approaches: latin script, chinese script, and ciphers, for which we significantly improve state-of-the-art performances.

Generalizable Person Re-identification via Balancing Alignment and Uniformity
Domain generalizable person re-identification (DG re-ID) aims to learn discriminative representations that are robust to distributional shifts. While data augmentation is a straightforward solution to improve generalization, certain augmentations exhibit a polarized effect in this task, enhancing in-distribution performance but degrading out-of-distribution performance. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon and reveal that it leads to sparse representation spaces with reduced uniformity. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, Balancing Alignment and Uniformity (BAU), that effectively mitigates these effects by maintaining a balance between alignment and uniformity. Specifically, BAU incorporates alignment and uniformity losses applied to both original and augmented images and integrates a weighting strategy to assess the reliability of augmented samples, further improving the alignment loss. Additionally, we introduce a domain-specific uniformity loss that promotes uniformity within each source domain, thereby enhancing the learning of domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BAU effectively exploits the advantages of data augmentation, which previous studies could not fully utilize, and achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring complex training procedures. The code will be made publicly available.

Generalizablity of Memorization Neural Network
The neural network memorization problem is to study the expressive power of neural networks to interpolate a finite dataset. Although memorization is widely believed to have a close relationship with the strong generalizability of deep learning when using overparameterized models, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no theoretical study on the generalizability of memorization neural networks. In this paper, we give the first theoretical analysis of this topic. Since using i.i.d. training data is a necessary condition for a learning algorithm to be generalizable, memorization and its generalization theory for i.i.d. datasets are developed under mild conditions on the data distribution. First, algorithms are given to construct memorization networks for an i.i.d. dataset, which have the smallest number of parameters and even a constant number of parameters. Second, we show that, in order for the memorization networks to be generalizable, the width of the network must be at least equal to the dimension of the data, which implies that the existing memorization networks with an optimal number of parameters are not generalizable. Third, a lower bound for the sample complexity of general memorization algorithms and the exact sample complexity for memorization algorithms with constant number of parameters are given. As a consequence, it is shown that there exist data distributions such that, to be generalizable for them, the memorization network must have an exponential number of parameters in the data dimension. Finally, an efficient and generalizable memorization algorithm is given when the number of training samples is greater than the efficient memorization sample complexity of the data distribution.

Generalization Analysis for Label-Specific Representation Learning
Label-specific representation learning (LSRL), i.e., constructing the representation with specific discriminative properties for each class label, is an effective strategy to improve the performance of multi-label learning. However, the generalization analysis of LSRL is still in its infancy. The existing theory bounds for multi-label learning, which preserve the coupling among different components, are invalid for LSRL. In an attempt to overcome this challenge and make up for the gap in the generalization theory of LSRL, we develop a novel vector-contraction inequality and derive the generalization bound for general function class of LSRL with a tighter dependency on the number of labels than the state of the art. In addition, we derive generalization bounds for typical LSRL methods, and these theoretical results reveal the impact of different label-specific representations on generalization analysis. The mild bounds without strong assumptions explain the good generalization ability of LSRL.

Generalization Beyond Data Imbalance: A Controlled Study on CLIP for Transferable Insights
The CLIP model has demonstrated great effectiveness in learning generalizable representations from web-scale vision-language pre-training datasets. This paper is motivated by a surprising finding that CLIP, trained on naturally imbalanced web data, exhibits remarkable robustness to data imbalance compared to supervised learning. We aim to investigate the reasons behind this robustness. Our controlled experiments reveal that CLIP's pretext task forms a dynamic classification problem wherein only a subset of classes is present in training. This isolates biases from dominant classes and implicitly balances the learning signal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the robustness and discriminability of CLIP improve through increased density in language supervision, larger data scale, and broader open-world concepts, which are inaccessible to supervised learning. Our study not only uncovers the mechanisms behind CLIP's generalizability beyond data imbalance but also provides transferable insights for the research community. The findings are validated in both supervised and self-supervised learning, enabling models trained on imbalanced data to achieve CLIP-level performance on diverse recognition tasks. The code and data will be made publicly available.

Generalization Bound and Learning Methods for Data-Driven Projections in Linear Programming
How to solve high-dimensional linear programs (LPs) efficiently is a fundamental question.Recently, there has been a surge of interest in reducing LP sizes using *random projections*, which can accelerate solving LPs independently of improving LP solvers. This paper explores a new direction of *data-driven projections*, which use projection matrices learned from data instead of random projection matrices.Given training data of $n$-dimensional LPs, we learn an $n\times k$ projection matrix with $n > k$. When addressing a future LP instance, we reduce its dimensionality from $n$ to $k$ via the learned projection matrix, solve the resulting LP to obtain a $k$-dimensional solution, and apply the learned matrix to it to recover an $n$-dimensional solution.On the theoretical side, a natural question is: how much data is sufficient to ensure the quality of recovered solutions? We address this question based on the framework of *data-driven algorithm design*, which connects the amount of data sufficient for establishing generalization bounds to the *pseudo-dimension* of performance metrics. We obtain an $\tilde{\mathrm{O}}(nk^2)$ upper bound on the pseudo-dimension, where $\tilde{\mathrm{O}}$ compresses logarithmic factors. We also provide an $\Omega(nk)$ lower bound, implying our result is tight up to an $\tilde{\mathrm{O}}(k)$ factor. On the practical side, we explore two simple methods for learning projection matrices: PCA- and gradient-based methods. While the former is relatively efficient, the latter can sometimes achieve better solution quality. Experiments demonstrate that learning projection matrices from data is indeed beneficial: it leads to significantly higher solution quality than the existing random projection while greatly reducing the time for solving LPs.

Generalization Bounds via Conditional $f$-Information
In this work, we introduce novel information-theoretic generalization bounds using the conditional $f$-information framework, an extension of the traditional conditional mutual information (MI) framework. We provide a generic approach to derive generalization bounds via $f$-information in the supersample setting, applicable to both bounded and unbounded loss functions. Unlike previous MI-based bounds, our proof strategy does not rely on upper bounding the cumulant-generating function (CGF) in the variational formula of MI. Instead, we set the CGF or its upper bound to zero by carefully selecting the measurable function. Although some of our techniques are inspired by recent advances in the coin-betting framework, our results are independent of any prior findings from regret guarantees of online gambling algorithms. Additionally, our newly derived MI-based bound recovers many previous results and improves our understanding of their potential limitations. Finally, we empirically compare various $f$-information measures for generalization, demonstrating improvement of our new bounds over the previous bounds.

Generalization Error Bounds for Two-stage Recommender Systems with Tree Structure
Two-stage recommender systems play a crucial role in efficiently identifying relevant items and personalizing recommendations from a vast array of options. This paper, based on an error decomposition framework, analyzes the generalization error for two-stage recommender systems with a tree structure, which consist of an efficient tree-based retriever and a more precise yet time-consuming ranker. We use the Rademacher complexity to establish the generalization upper bound for various tree-based retrievers using beam search, as well as for different ranker models under a shifted training distribution. Both theoretical insights and practical experiments on real-world datasets indicate that increasing the branches in tree-based retrievers and harmonizing distributions across stages can enhance the generalization performance of two-stage recommender systems.

Generalization of Hamiltonian algorithms
A method to prove generalization results for a class of stochastic learning algorithms is presented. It applies whenever the algorithm generates a distribution, which is absolutely continuous distribution relative to some a-priori measure, and the logarithm of its density is exponentially concentrated about its mean. Applications include bounds for the Gibbs algorithm and randomizations of stable deterministic algorithms, combinations thereof and PAC-Bayesian bounds with data-dependent priors.

Generalized Eigenvalue Problems with Generative Priors
Generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs) find applications in various fields of science and engineering. For example, principal component analysis, Fisher's discriminant analysis, and canonical correlation analysis are specific instances of GEPs and are widely used in statistical data processing. In this work, we study GEPs under generative priors, assuming that the underlying leading generalized eigenvector lies within the range of a Lipschitz continuous generative model. Under appropriate conditions, we show that any optimal solution to the corresponding optimization problems attains the optimal statistical rate. Moreover, from a computational perspective, we propose an iterative algorithm called the Projected Rayleigh Flow Method (PRFM) to approximate the optimal solution. We theoretically demonstrate that under suitable assumptions, PRFM converges linearly to an estimated vector that achieves the optimal statistical rate. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Generalize or Detect? Towards Robust Semantic Segmentation Under Multiple Distribution Shifts
In open-world scenarios, where both novel classes and domains may exist, an ideal segmentation model should detect anomaly classes for safety and generalize to new domains. However, existing methods often struggle to distinguish between domain-level and semantic-level distribution shifts, leading to poor OOD detection or domain generalization performance. In this work, we aim to equip the model to generalize effectively to covariate-shift regions while precisely identifying semantic-shift regions. To achieve this, we design a novel generative augmentation method to produce coherent images that incorporate both anomaly (or novel) objects and various covariate shifts at both image and object levels. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy that recalibrates uncertainty specifically for semantic shifts and enhances the feature extractor to align features associated with domain shifts. We validate the effectiveness of our method across benchmarks featuring both semantic and domain shifts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks for both OOD detection and domain generalization.

Generalizing Consistency Policy to Visual RL with Prioritized Proximal Experience Regularization
With high-dimensional state spaces, visual reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in exploitation and exploration, resulting in low sample efficiency and training stability. As a time-efficient diffusion model, although consistency models have been validated in online state-based RL, it is still an open question whether it can be extended to visual RL. In this paper, we investigate the impact of non-stationary distribution and the actor-critic framework on consistency policy in online RL, and find that consistency policy was unstable during the training, especially in visual RL with the high-dimensional state space. To this end, we suggest sample-based entropy regularization to stabilize the policy training, and propose a consistency policy with prioritized proximal experience regularization (CP3ER) to improve sample efficiency. CP3ER achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 21 tasks across DeepMind control suite and Meta-world. To our knowledge, CP3ER is the first method to apply diffusion/consistency models to visual RL and demonstrates the potential of consistency models in visual RL.

Generating compositional scenes via Text-to-image RGBA Instance Generation
Text-to-image diffusion generative models can generate high quality images at the cost of tedious prompt engineering. Controllability can be improved by introducing layout conditioning, however existing methods lack layout editing ability and fine-grained control over object attributes. In this work, we propose to address layout-driven controllable image generation from a multi-layer perspective. We devise a novel training paradigm to adapt a diffusion model to generate isolated objects as RGBA images with transparency information. To build complex scenes, we then generate object scene components individually and introduce a multi-layer noise blending strategy to build a realistic composite scene. Our experiments show that our RGBA diffusion model is capable of generating diverse and high quality instances with precise control over object attributes. Through multi-layer composition, we demonstrate that our approach allows to build and manipulate complex scenes with fine-grained control over object appearance and location, granting a higher degree of control than competing methods.

Generating Highly Designable Proteins with Geometric Algebra Flow Matching
We introduce a generative model for protein backbone design utilizing geometric products and higher order message passing. In particular, we extend a state-of-the-art model for protein backbone generation, FrameFlow, and represent the frames of the protein backbone as elements of the projective geometric algebra. This enables to use geometrically more expressive bilinear geometric products as paradigm for higher order message passing. The proposed model achieves high designability and diversity, while also sampling protein backbones that closely follow the statistical distribution of secondary structure elements found in naturally occurring proteins, a property so far only insufficiently achieved by state-of-the-art generative models.

Generative Adversarial Bayesian Optimization for Surrogate Objectives
Offline model-based policy optimization seeks to optimize against a learned surrogate model without querying the true oracle objective function during optimization. However, inaccurate surrogate model predictions are frequently encountered along the optimization trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose **generative adversarial Bayesian optimization (GABO)** using *adaptive source critic regularization*, a task-agnostic framework for Bayesian optimization that employs a Lipschitz-bounded source critic model to constrain the optimization trajectory to regions where the surrogate function is reliable. We show that under certain assumptions for the continuous input space prior, our algorithm can dynamically adjust the strength of the source critic regularization. GABO outperforms existing baselines on a number of different offline optimization tasks across a variety of scientific domains.

Generative Forests
We focus on generative AI for a type of data that still represent one of the most prevalent form of data: tabular data. We introduce a new powerful class of forest-based models fit for such tasks and a simple training algorithm with strong convergence guarantees in a boosting model that parallels that of the original weak / strong supervised learning setting. This algorithm can be implemented by a few tweaks to the most popular induction scheme for decision tree induction (*i.e. supervised learning*) with two classes. Experiments on the quality of generated data display substantial improvements compared to the state of the art. The losses our algorithm minimize and the structure of our models make them practical for related tasks that require fast estimation of a density given a generative model and an observation (even partially specified): such tasks include missing data imputation and density estimation. Additional experiments on these tasks reveal that our models can be notably good contenders to diverse state of the art methods, relying on models as diverse as (or mixing elements of) trees, neural nets, kernels or graphical models.

Generative Fractional Diffusion Models
We introduce the first continuous-time score-based generative model that leverages fractional diffusion processes for its underlying dynamics. Although diffusion models have excelled at capturing data distributions, they still suffer from various limitations such as slow convergence, mode-collapse on imbalanced data, and lack of diversity. These issues are partially linked to the use of light-tailed Brownian motion (BM) with independent increments. In this paper, we replace BM with an approximation of its non-Markovian counterpart, fractional Brownian motion (fBM), characterized by correlated increments and Hurst index $H \in (0,1)$, where $H=1/2$ recovers the classical BM. To ensure tractable inference and learning, we employ a recently popularized Markov approximation of fBM (MA-fBM) and derive its reverse time model, resulting in \emph{generative fractional diffusion models} (GFDM). We characterize the forward dynamics using a continuous reparameterization trick and propose an augmented score matching to efficiently learn the score-function, which is partly known in closed form, at minimal added cost. The ability to drive our diffusion model via fBM provides flexibility and control. $H<1/2$ enters the regime of \emph{rough paths} leading to diverse outcome whereas $H>1/2$ regularizes diffusion paths and invokes long-term memory as well as a heavy-tailed behaviour (super-diffusion). The Markov approximation allows added control by varying the number of Markov processes linearly combined to approximate fBM. Our evaluations on real image datasets demonstrate that GFDM achieves greater pixel-wise diversity and enhanced image quality, as indicated by a lower FID, offering a promising alternative to traditional diffusion models.

Generative Modelling of Structurally Constrained Graphs
Graph diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art techniques in graph generation, yet integrating domain knowledge into these models remains challenging. Domain knowledge is particularly important in real-world scenarios, where invalid generated graphs hinder deployment in practical applications.Unconstrained and conditioned graph generative models fail to guarantee such domain-specific structural properties. We present ConStruct, a novel framework that allows for hard-constraining graph diffusion models to incorporate specific properties, such as planarity or acyclicity.Our approach ensures that the sampled graphs remain within the domain of graphs that verify the specified property throughout the entire trajectory in both the forward and reverse processes. This is achieved by introducing a specific edge-absorbing noise model and a new projector operator.ConStruct demonstrates versatility across several structural and edge-deletion invariant constraints and achieves state-of-the-art performance for both synthetic benchmarks and attributed real-world datasets. For example, by leveraging planarity in digital pathology graph datasets, the proposed method outperforms existing baselines and enhances generated data validity by up to 71.1 percentage points.

Generative Retrieval Meets Multi-Graded Relevance
Generative retrieval represents a novel approach to information retrieval, utilizing an encoder-decoder architecture to directly produce relevant document identifiers (docids) for queries. While this method offers benefits, current implementations are limited to scenarios with binary relevance data, overlooking the potential for documents to have multi-graded relevance. Extending generative retrieval to accommodate multi-graded relevance poses challenges, including the need to reconcile likelihood probabilities for docid pairs and the possibility of multiple relevant documents sharing the same identifier. To address these challenges, we introduce a new framework called GRaded Generative Retrieval (GR$^2$). Our approach focuses on two key components: ensuring relevant and distinct identifiers, and implementing multi-graded constrained contrastive training. Firstly, we aim to create identifiers that are both semantically relevant and sufficiently distinct to represent individual documents effectively. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the relevance and distinctness of docids through a combination of docid generation and autoencoder models. Secondly, we incorporate information about the relationship between relevance grades to guide the training process. Specifically, we leverage a constrained contrastive training strategy to bring the representations of queries and the identifiers of their relevant documents closer together, based on their respective relevance grades.Extensive experiments on datasets with both multi-graded and binary relevance demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Generative Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection
This work considers a practical semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) scenario, where part of the nodes in a graph are known to be normal, contrasting to the extensively explored unsupervised setting with a fully unlabeled graph. We reveal that having access to the normal nodes, even just a small percentage of normal nodes, helps enhance the detection performance of existing unsupervised GAD methods when they are adapted to the semi-supervised setting. However, their utilization of these normal nodes is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel Generative GAD approach (namely GGAD) for the semi-supervised scenario to better exploit the normal nodes. The key idea is to generate pseudo anomaly nodes, referred to as 'outlier nodes', for providing effective negative node samples in training a discriminative one-class classifier. The main challenge here lies in the lack of ground truth information about real anomaly nodes. To address this challenge, GGAD is designed to leverage two important priors about the anomaly nodes -- asymmetric local affinity and egocentric closeness -- to generate reliable outlier nodes that assimilate anomaly nodes in both graph structure and feature representations. Comprehensive experiments on six real-world GAD datasets are performed to establish a benchmark for semi-supervised GAD and show that GGAD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised GAD methods with varying numbers of training normal nodes.

Genetic-guided GFlowNets for Sample Efficient Molecular Optimization
The challenge of discovering new molecules with desired properties is crucial in domains like drug discovery and material design. Recent advances in deep learning-based generative methods have shown promise but face the issue of sample efficiency due to the computational expense of evaluating the reward function. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for sample-efficient molecular optimization by distilling a powerful genetic algorithm into deep generative policy using GFlowNets training, the off-policy method for amortized inference. This approach enables the deep generative policy to learn from domain knowledge, which has been explicitly integrated into the genetic algorithm. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the official molecular optimization benchmark, significantly outperforming previous methods. It also demonstrates effectiveness in designing inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 with substantially fewer reward calls.

GENOT: A Neural Optimal Transport Framework for Single Cell Genomics
Single-cell genomics has significantly advanced our understanding of cellular behavior, catalyzing innovations in treatments and precision medicine. However, single-cell sequencing technologies are inherently destructive and can only measure a limited array of data modalities simultaneously. This limitation underscores the need for new methods capable of realigning cells. Optimal transport (OT) has emerged as a potent solution, but traditional discrete solvers are hampered by scalability, privacy, and out-of-sample estimation issues. These challenges have spurred the development of neural network-based solvers that parameterize OT maps, known as neural OT solvers. Yet, these models often lack the flexibility needed for broader life sciences applications. To address these deficiencies, our approach introduces stochastic transport plans, relaxes mass conservation rules, and adopts adaptable cost functions, along with integrating quadratic solvers to tackle the complex challenges posed by Gromov-Wasserstein and Fused Gromov-Wasserstein problems. Utilizing the generative power of flow matching, our method offers a flexible and effective framework. We demonstrate its versatility and robustness through applications in cell development studies, cellular drug response modeling, and cross-modality cell translation, illustrating significant potential for enhancing therapeutic strategies.

GenRec: Unifying Video Generation and Recognition with Diffusion Models
Video diffusion models are able to generate high-quality videos by learning strong spatial-temporal priors on large-scale datasets. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether such priors derived from a generative process are suitable for video recognition, and eventually joint optimization of generation and recognition. Building upon Stable Video Diffusion, we introduce GenRec, the first unified framework trained with a random-frame conditioning process so as to learn generalized spatial-temporal representations. The resulting framework can naturally supports generation and recognition, and more importantly is robust even when visual inputs contain limited information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of GenRec for both recognition and generation. In particular, GenRec achieves competitive recognition performance, offering 75.8% and 87.2% accuracy on SSV2 and K400, respectively. GenRec also performs the best class-conditioned image-to-video prediction results, achieving 46.5 and 49.3 FVD scores on SSV2 and EK-100 datasets. Furthermore, GenRec demonstrates extraordinary robustness in scenarios that only limited frames can be observed.

GenWarp: Single Image to Novel Views with Semantic-Preserving Generative Warping
Generating novel views from a single image remains a challenging task due to the complexity of 3D scenes and the limited diversity in the existing multi-view datasets to train a model on. Recent research combining large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models with monocular depth estimation (MDE) has shown promise in handling in-the-wild images. In these methods, an input view is geometrically warped to novel views with estimated depth maps, then the warped image is inpainted by T2I models. However, they struggle with noisy depth maps and loss of semantic details when warping an input view to novel viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for single-shot novel view synthesis, a semantic-preserving generative warping framework that enables T2I generative models to learn where to warp and where to generate, through augmenting cross-view attention with self-attention. Our approach addresses the limitations of existing methods by conditioning the generative model on source view images and incorporating geometric warping signals. Our framework can leverage large-scale 2D diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion to inherit their generalization capabilities. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.

Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift Adaptation on EEG data
Electroencephalography (EEG) data is often collected from diverse contexts involving different populations and EEG devices. This variability can induce distribution shifts in the data $X$ and in the biomedical variables of interest $y$, thus limiting the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. While domain adaptation (DA) methods have been developed to mitigate the impact of these shifts, such methods struggle when distribution shifts occur simultaneously in $X$ and $y$. As state-of-the-art ML models for EEG represent the data by spatial covariance matrices, which lie on the Riemannian manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, it is appealing to study DA techniques operating on the SPD manifold. This paper proposes a novel method termed Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift Adaptation (GOPSA) to address test-time multi-source DA for situations in which source domains have distinct $y$ distributions. GOPSA exploits the geodesic structure of the Riemannian manifold to jointly learn a domain-specific re-centering operator representing site-specific intercepts and the regression model. We performed empirical benchmarks on the cross-site generalization of age-prediction models with resting-state EEG data from a large multi-national dataset (HarMNqEEG), which included $14$ recording sites and more than $1500$ human participants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our results showed that GOPSA achieved significantly higher performance on three regression metrics ($R^2$, MAE, and Spearman's $\rho$) for several source-target site combinations, highlighting its effectiveness in tackling multi-source DA with predictive shifts in EEG data analysis. Our method has the potential to combine the advantages of mixed-effects modeling with machine learning for biomedical applications of EEG, such as multicenter clinical trials.

GeoLRM: Geometry-Aware Large Reconstruction Model for High-Quality 3D Gaussian Generation
In this work, we introduce the Geometry-Aware Large Reconstruction Model (GeoLRM), an approach which can predict high-quality assets with 512k Gaussians and 21 input images in only 11 GB GPU memory. Previous works neglect the inherent sparsity of 3D structure and do not utilize explicit geometric relationships between 3D and 2D images. This leads to the fact that these methods can only receive a few views as inputs and are difficult to scale up to the dense views for better quality. GeoLRM tackles these issues by incorporating a novel 3D-aware transformer structure that directly processes 3D points and uses deformable cross-attention mechanisms to effectively integrate image features into 3D representations. We implement this solution through a two-stage pipeline: initially, a lightweight proposal network generates a sparse set of 3D anchor points from the posed image inputs; subsequently, a specialized reconstruction transformer refines the geometry and retrieves textural details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GeoLRM significantly outperforms existing models, especially for dense view inputs. We also demonstrate the practical applicability of our model with 3D generation tasks, showcasing its versatility and potential for broader adoption in real-world applications.

Geometric Analysis of Nonlinear Manifold Clustering
Manifold clustering is an important problem in motion and video segmentation, natural image clustering, and other applications where high-dimensional data lie on multiple, low-dimensional, nonlinear manifolds. While current state-of-the-art methods on large-scale datasets such as CIFAR provide good empirical performance, they do not have any proof of theoretical correctness. In this work, we propose a method that clusters data belonging to a union of nonlinear manifolds. Furthermore, for a given input data sample $y$ belonging to the $l$th manifold $\mathcal{M}_l$, we provide geometric conditions that guarantee a manifold-preserving representation of $y$ can be recovered from the solution to the proposed model. The geometric conditions require that (i) $\mathcal{M}_l$ is well-sampled in the neighborhood of $y$, with the sampling density given as a function of the curvature, and (ii) $\mathcal{M}_l$ is sufficiently separated from the other manifolds. In addition to providing proof of correctness in this setting, a numerical comparison with state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR datasets shows that our method performs competitively although marginally worse than methods without

Geometric-Averaged Preference Optimization for Soft Preference Labels
Many algorithms for aligning LLMs with human preferences assume that human preferences are binary and deterministic.However, it is reasonable to think that they can vary with different individuals, and thus should be distributional to reflect the subtle relationship between the responses.In this work, we introduce the distributional soft preference labels and improve Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a weighted geometric average of the LLM output likelihood in the loss function.In doing so, the scale of learning loss is adjusted based on the soft labels, and the loss with equally preferred responses would be close to zero.This simple modification can be easily applied to any DPO family, and help the models escape from the objective mismatch prior works suffer from.In our experiments, we simulate the soft preference labels with AI feedback from LLMs and demonstrate that geometric averaging consistently improves performance on standard benchmarks for alignment research. In particular, we observe significant improvements with data where modestly-confident labels are in the majority.

Geometric Exploitation for Indoor Panoramic Semantic Segmentation
PAnoramic Semantic Segmentation (PASS) is an important task in computer vision, as it enables semantic understanding of a 360° environment. Currently, most of the existing work has focused on addressing the distortion issues in 2D panoramic images without considering the spatial properties of indoor scenes. This restricts PASS methods in capturing contextual features , which are essential for dealing with ambiguity when working with monocular images. Unlike previous works, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for semantic segmentation of panoramic images. We consider the indoor panoramic image as a combination of two sets of segments: over-sampled, representing planar objects such as ceiling and floor, and under-sampled, representing for other elements. We then tailor optimization for these groups by leveraging geometric properties in different strategies as follows: First, we enforce geometrically consistent losses in the joint study of over-sampled segments with the dense depth estimation. Second, we propose to exploit the rich geometric representations of the indoor scene in different methods, aggregating them using a proposed Transformer-based Context Module. Combined with a simple high-resolution branch, it functions as a robust hybrid decoder for the estimating of under-sampled segments. This decoder not only prevents resolution degradation of the predicted masks but also allows the exploitation of relationships between different geometric components of the scene.Experimental results on the Stanford2D3D panoramic (real-world) and Structured3D (synthetic) datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, by setting a new a state-of-the-art in evaluation on both datasets, achieving approximately 56.8% and 71.7% mIoU, respectively. The code will be shared publicly if the paper is accepted.

Geometric Trajectory Diffusion Models
Generative models have shown great promise in generating 3D geometric systems, which is a fundamental problem in many natural science domains such as molecule and protein design. However, existing approaches only operate on static structures, neglecting the fact that physical systems are always dynamic in nature. In this work, we propose geometric trajectory diffusion models (GeoTDM), the first diffusion model for modeling the temporal distribution of 3D geometric trajectories. Modeling such distribution is challenging as it requires capturing both the complex spatial interactions with physical symmetries and temporal correspondence encapsulated in the dynamics. We theoretically justify that diffusion models with equivariant temporal kernels can lead to density with desired symmetry, and  develop a novel transition kernel leveraging SE(3)-equivariant spatial convolution and temporal attention. Furthermore, to induce an expressive trajectory distribution for conditional generation, we introduce a generalized learnable geometric prior into the forward diffusion process to enhance temporal conditioning. We conduct extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation in various scenarios, including physical simulation, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian motion. Empirical results on a wide suite of metrics demonstrate that GeoTDM can generate realistic geometric trajectories with significantly higher quality.

Geometry Awakening: Cross-Geometry Learning Exhibits Superiority over Individual Structures
Recent research has underscored the efficacy of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in modeling diverse geometric structures within graph data. However, real-world graphs typically exhibit geometrically heterogeneous characteristics, rendering the confinement to a single geometric paradigm insufficient for capturing their intricate structural complexities. To address this limitation, we examine the performance of GNNs across various geometries through the lens of knowledge distillation (KD) and introduce a novel cross-geometric framework. This framework encodes graphs by integrating both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries in a space-mixing fashion. Our approach employs multiple teacher models, each generating hint embeddings that encapsulate distinct geometric properties. We then implement a structure-wise knowledge transfer module that optimally leverages these embeddings within their respective geometric contexts, thereby enhancing the training efficacy of the student model. Additionally, our framework incorporates a geometric optimization network designed to bridge the distributional disparities among these embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that our model-agnostic framework more effectively captures topological graph knowledge, resulting in superior performance of the student models when compared to traditional KD methodologies.

Geometry of naturalistic object representations in recurrent neural network models of working memory
Working memory is a central cognitive ability crucial for intelligent decision-making. Recent experimental and computational work studying working memory has primarily been carried out using categorical stimuli, rather than ecologically-relevant, multidimensional naturalistic ones. Moreover, studies have primarily investigated working memory during single or few number of cognitive tasks. As a result, an understanding of how naturalistic object information is maintained in working memory in neural networks is still largely lacking. To bridge this gap, we developed sensory-cognitive models, comprising of a convolutional neural network (CNN) coupled with a recurrent neural network (RNN), and trained them on nine distinct N-back tasks using naturalistic stimuli. By examining the RNN’s latent space, we found that: 1) Multi-task RNNs represent both task-relevant and irrelevant information simultaneously while performing tasks; 2) While the latent subspaces used to maintain specific object properties in vanilla RNNs are largely shared across tasks, they are highly task-specific in gated RNNs such as GRU and LSTM; 3) RNNs embed objects in new representational spaces in which individual object feature axes are orthogonalized compared to the perceptual space, enhancing separation of features; 4) Across time, the model preserves the geometric structure of the latent subspace representing various object properties. Interestingly, the rotational dynamics governing the transformation of WM encodings (i.e., embedding of visual inputs in the RNN latent space) into memories was shared across stimuli, yet the transformations governing the retention of a memory in the face of incoming distractor stimuli were distinct across time. Our findings indicate that goal-driven RNNs employ orthogonalized \& chronological memory subspaces to track information over short time spans. This provides a basis for formulating testable predictions regarding the processing of natural object information in the cortex during working memory.

GeoNLF: Geometry guided Pose-Free Neural LiDAR Fields
Although recent efforts have extended Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) into LiDAR point cloud synthesis, the majority of existing works exhibit a strong dependence on precomputed poses. However, point cloud registration methods struggle to achieve precise global pose estimation, whereas previous pose-free NeRFs overlook geometric consistency in global reconstruction. In light of this, we explore the geometric insights of point clouds, which provide explicit registration priors for reconstruction. Based on this, we propose Geometry guided Neural LiDAR Fields (GeoNLF), a hybrid framework performing alternately global neural reconstruction and pure geometric pose optimization. Furthermore, NeRFs tend to overfit individual frames and easily get stuck in local minima under sparse-view inputs. To tackle this issue, we develop a selective-reweighting strategy and introduce geometric constraints for robust optimization. Extensive experiments on NuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate the superiority of GeoNLF in both novel view synthesis and multi-view registration of low-frequency large-scale point clouds.

GeSS: Benchmarking Geometric Deep Learning under Scientific Applications with Distribution Shifts
Geometric deep learning (GDL) has gained significant attention in scientific fields, for its proficiency in modeling data with intricate geometric structures. Yet, very few works have delved into its capability of tackling the distribution shift problem, a prevalent challenge in many applications.To bridge this gap, we propose GeSS, a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating the performance of GDL models in scientific scenarios with distribution shifts.Our evaluation datasets cover diverse scientific domains from particle physics, materials science to biochemistry, and encapsulate a broad spectrum of distribution shifts including conditional, covariate, and concept shifts. Furthermore, we study three levels of information access from the out-of-distribution (OOD) test data, including no OOD information, only unlabeled OOD data, and OOD data with a few labels. Overall, our benchmark results in 30 different experiment settings, and evaluates 3 GDL backbones and 11 learning algorithms in each setting. A thorough analysis of the evaluation results is provided, poised to illuminate insights for GDL researchers and domain practitioners who are to use GDL in their applications.

Get rich quick: exact solutions reveal how unbalanced initializations promote rapid feature learning
While the impressive performance of modern neural networks is often attributed to their capacity to efficiently extract task-relevant features from data, the mechanisms underlying this *rich feature learning regime* remain elusive, with much of our theoretical understanding stemming from the opposing *lazy regime*. In this work, we derive exact solutions to a minimal model that transitions between lazy and rich learning, precisely elucidating how unbalanced *layer-specific* initialization variances and learning rates determine the degree of feature learning. Our analysis reveals that they conspire to influence the learning regime through a set of conserved quantities that constrain and modify the geometry of learning trajectories in parameter and function space. We extend our analysis to more complex linear models with multiple neurons, outputs, and layers and to shallow nonlinear networks with piecewise linear activation functions. In linear networks, rapid feature learning only occurs with balanced initializations, where all layers learn at similar speeds. While in nonlinear networks, unbalanced initializations that promote faster learning in earlier layers can accelerate rich learning. Through a series of experiments, we provide evidence that this unbalanced rich regime drives feature learning in deep finite-width networks, promotes interpretability of early layers in CNNs, reduces the sample complexity of learning hierarchical data, and decreases the time to grokking in modular arithmetic. Our theory motivates further exploration of unbalanced initializations to enhance efficient feature learning.

Gliding over the Pareto Front with Uniform Designs
Multiobjective optimization (MOO) plays a critical role in various real-world domains. A major challenge therein is generating $K$ uniform Pareto-optimal solutions that represent the entire Pareto front. To address the very challenge, this study first introduces \emph{fill distance} to evaluate the $K$ design points, which provides a quantitative metric for the representativeness of the design. However, the direct specification of the optimal design that minimizes fill distance is almost intractable considering the nested $\min-\max-\min$ optimization problem; we further propose a surrogate to the fill distance, which is easier to optimize and induce a rate-optimal design whose fill distance proves at most $4\times$ the minimum one. Rigorous derivation also shows that asymptotically this induced design will converge to the uniform measure over the Pareto front. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed paradigm efficiently produces high-quality, representative solutions and outperforms baseline methods. The model implementation and code will be open-sourced upon publication.

GLinSAT: The General Linear Satisfiability Neural Network Layer By Accelerated Gradient Descent
Ensuring that the outputs of neural networks satisfy specific constraints is crucial for applying neural networks to real-life decision-making problems. In this paper, we consider making a batch of neural network outputs satisfy bounded and general linear constraints. We first reformulate the neural network output projection problem as an entropy-regularized linear programming problem. We show that such a problem can be equivalently transformed into an unconstrained convex optimization problem with Lipschitz continuous gradient according to the duality theorem. Then, based on an accelerated gradient descent algorithm with numerical performance enhancement, we present our architecture, GLinSAT, to solve the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general linear satisfiability layer in which all the operations are differentiable and matrix-factorization-free. Despite the fact that we can explicitly perform backpropagation based on automatic differentiation mechanism, we also provide an alternative approach in GLinSAT to calculate the derivatives based on implicit differentiation of the optimality condition. Experimental results on constrained traveling salesman problems, partial graph matching with outliers, predictive portfolio allocation and power system unit commitment demonstrate the advantages of GLinSAT over existing satisfiability layers.

Global Convergence in Training Large-Scale Transformers
Despite the widespread success of Transformers across various domains, their optimization guarantees in large-scale model settings are not well-understood. This paper rigorously analyzes the convergence properties of gradient flow in training Transformers with weight decay regularization. First, we construct the mean-field limit of large-scale Transformers, showing that as the model width and depth go to infinity, gradient flow converges to the Wasserstein gradient flow, which is represented by a partial differential equation. Then, we demonstrate that the gradient flow reaches a global minimum consistent with the PDE solution when the weight decay regularization parameter is sufficiently small. Our analysis is based on a series of novel mean-field techniques that adapt to Transformers. Compared with existing tools for deep networks (Lu et al., 2020) that demand homogeneity and global Lipschitz smoothness, we utilize a refined analysis assuming only $\textit{partial homogeneity}$ and $\textit{local Lipschitz smoothness}$. These new techniques may be of independent interest.

Globally Convergent Variational Inference
In variational inference (VI), an approximation of the posterior distribution is selected from a family of distributions through numerical optimization. With the most common variational objective function, known as the evidence lower bound (ELBO), only convergence to a *local* optimum can be guaranteed. In this work, we instead establish the *global* convergence of a particular VI method. This VI method, which may be considered an instance of neural posterior estimation (NPE), minimizes an expectation of the inclusive (forward) KL divergence to fit a variational distribution that is parameterized by a neural network. Our convergence result relies on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to characterize the gradient dynamics that arise from considering the variational objective in function space. In the asymptotic regime of a fixed, positive-definite neural tangent kernel, we establish conditions under which the variational objective admits a unique solution in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Then, we show that the gradient descent dynamics in function space converge to this unique function. In ablation studies and practical problems, we demonstrate that our results explain the behavior of NPE in non-asymptotic finite-neuron settings, and show that NPE outperforms ELBO-based optimization, which often converges to shallow local optima.

GlotCC: An Open Broad-Coverage CommonCrawl Corpus and Pipeline for Minority Languages
The need for large text corpora has increased with the advent of pretrained lan- guage models and, in particular, the discovery of scaling laws for these models. Most available corpora have sufficient data only for languages with large dominant communities. However, there is no corpus available that (i) covers a wide range of minority languages, (ii) is generated by an open-source reproducible pipeline and (iii) is rigorously cleaned from noise, making it trustworthy to use. We present GlotCC, a clean, document-level, 2TB general domain corpus derived from CommonCrawl, covering more than 1000 languages. We make GlotCC and the system used to generate it, including pipeline, language identification model and filters, available to the research community.

GO4Align: Group Optimization for Multi-Task Alignment
This paper proposes **GO4Align**, a multi-task optimization approach that tackles task imbalance by explicitly aligning the optimization across tasks. To achieve this, we design an adaptive group risk minimization strategy, comprising two techniques in implementation: (i) dynamical group assignment, which clusters similar tasks based on task interactions; (ii) risk-guided group indicators, which exploit consistent task correlations with risk information from previous iterations. Comprehensive experimental results on diverse benchmarks demonstrate our method's performance superiority with even lower computational costs.

Goal-Conditioned On-Policy Reinforcement Learning
Existing Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) algorithms are built upon Hindsight Experience Replay (HER), which densifies rewards through hindsight replay and leverages historical goal-achieving information to construct a learning curriculum. However, when the task is characterized by a non-Markovian reward (NMR), whose computation depends on multiple steps of states and actions, HER can no longer densify rewards by treating a single encountered state as the hindsight goal. The lack of informative rewards hinders policy learning, resulting in rolling out failed trajectories. Consequently, the replay buffer is overwhelmed with failed trajectories, impeding the establishment of an applicable curriculum. To circumvent these limitations, we deviate from existing HER-based methods and propose an on-policy GCRL framework, GCPO, which is applicable to both multi-goal Markovian reward (MR) and NMR problems. GCPO consists of (1) Pre-training from Demonstrations, which pre-trains the policy to possess an initial goal-achieving capability, thereby diminishing the difficulty of subsequent online learning. (2) Online Self-Curriculum Learning, which first estimates the policy’s goal-achieving capability based on historical evaluation information and then selects progressively challenging goals for learning based on its current capability. We evaluate GCPO on a challenging multi-goal long-horizon task: fixed-wing UAV velocity vector control. Experimental results demonstrate that GCPO is capable of effectively addressing both multi-goal MR and NMR problems.

GOUDA: A General Graph Contrastive Learning Framework via Augmentation Unification
In real-world scenarios, networks (graphs) and their tasks possess unique characteristics, requiring the development of a versatile graph augmentation (GA) to meet the varied demands of network analysis. Unfortunately, the majority of Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) frameworks are hampered by the specificity, complexity, and incompleteness of their GA techniques. Firstly, GAs designed for specific scenarios may compromise the universality of models if mishandled. Secondly, the process of identifying and generating optimal augmentations generally involves substantial computational overhead. Finally, the effectiveness of the GCL, even the learnable ones, is constrained by the finite selection of GAs available. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel unified GA module, named UGA, after elucidating the local invariance for GCLs from the message-passing perspective of the graph encoder. In theory, this module has the capacity to generalize any explicit GAs (i.e., node, edge, attribute, and subgraph augmentations). Based on the proposed UGA, a novel general GCL framework, dubbed Graph cOntrastive UnifieD Augmentations (GOUDA), is proposed. It seamlessly integrates widely adopted contrastive losses and an introduced independence loss to fulfill the common requirements of consistency and diversity of augmentation across diverse scenarios. Evaluations across various datasets and tasks demonstrate the generality and efficiency of the proposed GOUDA over existing state-of-the-art GCLs.

Gradient-based Discrete Sampling with Automatic Cyclical Scheduling
Discrete distributions are often highly multimodal due to discontinuities inherent in their spaces, especially in high-dimensional distributions encountered in deep models. While gradient-based discrete sampling has proven effective for sampling in discrete spaces, it is susceptible to becoming trapped in local modes due to the gradient information. To tackle this challenge, we propose an automatic cyclical scheduling, designed for efficient and accurate sampling in multimodal discrete distributions. Our method contains three key components: (1) a cyclical step size schedule where large steps discover new modes and small steps exploit each mode; (2) a cyclical balancing schedule, ensuring "balanced" proposals for a given step size; and (3) an automatic tuning scheme for adjusting the hyperparameters in the cyclical schedules, allowing adaptability across diverse datasets without manual tuning. We prove the non-asymptotic convergence of our method in general discrete distributions. Various experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in learning complex multimodal discrete distributions.

Gradient-free Decoder Inversion in Latent Diffusion Models
In latent diffusion models (LDMs), denoising diffusion process efficiently takes place on latent space whose dimension is lower than that of pixel space. Decoder is typically used to transform the representation in latent space to that in pixel space. While a decoder is assumed to have an encoder as an accurate inverse, exact encoder-decoder pair rarely exists in practice even though applications often require precise inversion of decoder. Prior works for decoder inversion in LDMs employed gradient descent inspired by inversions of generative adversarial networks. However, gradient-based methods require larger GPU memory and longer computation time for larger latent space. For example, recent video LDMs can generate more than 16 frames, but GPUs with 24 GB memory can only perform gradient-based decoder inversion for 4 frames. Here, we propose an efficient gradient-free decoder inversion for LDMs, which can be applied to diverse latent models. Theoretical convergence property of our proposed inversion has been investigated not only for the forward step method, but also for the inertial Krasnoselskii-Mann (KM) iterations under mild assumption on cocoercivity that is satisfied by recent LDMs. Our proposed gradient-free method with Adam optimizer and learning rate scheduling significantly reduced computation time and memory usage over prior gradient-based methods and enabled efficient computation in applications such as noise-space watermarking while achieving comparable error levels.

Gradient Guidance for Diffusion Models: An Optimization Perspective
Diffusion models have demonstrated empirical successes in various applications and can be adapted to task-specific needs via guidance. This paper studies a form of gradient guidance for adapting a pre-trained diffusion model towards optimizing user-specified objectives. We establish a mathematical framework for guided diffusion to systematically study its optimization theory and algorithmic design. Our theoretical analysis spots a strong link between guided diffusion models and optimization: gradient-guided diffusion models are essentially sampling solutions to a regularized optimization problem, where the regularization is imposed by the pre-training data. As for guidance design, directly bringing in the gradient of an external objective function as guidance would jeopardize the structure in generated samples. To remedy this failure, we introduce a modified form of gradient guidance based on a forward prediction loss, which leverages the information in pre-trained score functions and provably preserves the latent structure. We further consider an iteratively fine-tuned version of gradient-guided diffusion where guidance and score network are both updated with newly generated samples. This process mimics a first-order optimization iteration in expectation, for which we proved $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/K)$ convergence rate to the global optimum when the objective function is concave.

Gradual Domain Adaptation via Manifold-Constrained Distributionally Robust Optimization
The aim of this paper is to address the challenge of gradual domain adaptation within a class of manifold-constrained data distributions. In particular, we consider a sequence of $T\ge2$ data distributions $P_1,\ldots,P_T$ undergoing a gradual shift, where each pair of consecutive measures $P_i,P_{i+1}$ are close to each other in Wasserstein distance. We have a supervised dataset of size $n$ sampled from $P_0$, while for the subsequent distributions in the sequence, only unlabeled i.i.d. samples are available. Moreover, we assume that all distributions exhibit a known favorable attribute, such as (but not limited to) having intra-class soft/hard margins. In this context, we propose a methodology rooted in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) with an adaptive Wasserstein radius. We theoretically show that this method guarantees the classification error across all $P_i$s can be suitably bounded. Our bounds rely on a newly introduced {\it {compatibility}} measure, which fully characterizes the error propagation dynamics along the sequence. Specifically, for inadequately constrained distributions, the error can exponentially escalate as we progress through the gradual shifts. Conversely, for appropriately constrained distributions, the error can be demonstrated to be linear or even entirely eradicated. We have substantiated our theoretical findings through several experimental results.

GRANOLA: Adaptive Normalization for Graph Neural Networks
Despite the widespread adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), these models often incorporate off-the-shelf normalization layers like BatchNorm or InstanceNorm, which were not originally designed for GNNs. Consequently, these normalization layers may not effectively capture the unique characteristics of graph-structured data, potentially even weakening the expressive power of the overall architecture. While existing graph-specific normalization layers have been proposed, they often struggle to offer substantial and consistent benefits.In this paper, we propose GRANOLA, a novel graph-adaptive normalization layer. Unlike existing normalization layers, GRANOLA normalizes node features by adapting to the specific characteristics of the graph, particularly by generating expressive representations of its nodes, obtained by leveraging the propagation of Random Node Features (RNF) in the graph. We provide theoretical results that support our design choices as well as an extensive empirical evaluation demonstrating the superior performance of GRANOLA over existing normalization techniques. Furthermore, GRANOLA emerges as the top-performing method among all baselines in the same time complexity class of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs).

Graph Classification via Reference Distribution Learning: Theory and Practice
Graph classification is a challenging problem owing to the difficulty in quantifying the similarity between graphs or representing graphs as vectors, though there have been a few methods using graph kernels or graph neural networks (GNNs). Graph kernels often suffer from computational costs and manual feature engineering, while GNNs commonly utilize global pooling operations, risking the loss of structural or semantic information. This work introduces Graph Reference Distribution Learning (GRDL), an efficient and accurate graph classification method. GRDL treats each graph's latent node embeddings given by GNN layers as a discrete distribution, enabling direct classification without global pooling, based on maximum mean discrepancy to adaptively learned reference distributions. To fully understand this new model (the existing theories do not apply) and guide its configuration (e.g., network architecture, references' sizes, number, and regularization) for practical use, we derive generalization error bounds for GRDL and verify them numerically. More importantly, our theoretical and numerical results both show that GRDL has a stronger generalization ability than GNNs with global pooling operations. Experiments on moderate-scale and large-scale graph datasets show the superiority of GRDL over the state-of-the-art, emphasizing its remarkable efficiency, being at least 10 times faster than leading competitors in both training and inference stages.

Graph Coarsening with Message-Passing Guarantees
Graph coarsening aims to reduce the size of a large graph while preserving some of its key properties, which has been used in many applications to reduce computational load and memory footprint. For instance, in graph machine learning, training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on coarsened graphs leads to drastic savings in time and memory. However, GNNs rely on the Message-Passing (MP) paradigm, and classical spectral preservation guarantees for graph coarsening do not directly lead to theoretical guarantees when performing naive message-passing on the coarsened graph.In this work, we propose a new message-passing operation specific to coarsened graphs, which exhibit theoretical guarantees on the preservation of the propagated signal. Interestingly, and in a sharp departure from previous proposals, this operation on coarsened graphs is oriented, even when the original graph is undirected. We conduct node classification tasks on synthetic and real data and observe improved results compared to performing naive message-passing on the coarsened graph.

Graphcode: Learning from multiparameter persistent homology using graph neural networks
We introduce graphcodes, a novel multi-scale summary of the topological properties of a dataset that is based on the well-established theory of persistent homology. Graphcodes handle datasets that are filtered along two real-valued scale parameters. Such multi-parameter topological summaries are usually based on complicated theoretical foundations and difficult to compute; in contrast, graphcodes yield an informative and interpretable summary and can be computed as efficient as one-parameter summaries. Moreover, a graphcode is simply an embedded graph and can therefore be readily integrated in machine learning pipelines using graph neural networks. We describe such a pipeline and demonstrate that graphcodes achieve better classification accuracy than state-of-the-art approaches on various datasets.

GraphCroc: Cross-Correlation Autoencoder for Graph Structural Reconstruction
Graph-structured data is integral to many applications, prompting the development of various graph representation methods. Graph autoencoders (GAEs), in particular, reconstruct graph structures from node embeddings. Current GAE models primarily utilize self-correlation to represent graph structures and focus on node-level tasks, often overlooking multi-graph scenarios. Our theoretical analysis indicates that self-correlation generally falls short in accurately representing specific graph features such as islands, symmetrical structures, and directional edges, particularly in smaller or multiple graph contexts.To address these limitations, we introduce a cross-correlation mechanism that significantly enhances the GAE representational capabilities. Additionally, we propose the GraphCroc, a new GAE that supports flexible encoder architectures tailored for various downstream tasks and ensures robust structural reconstruction, through a mirrored encoding-decoding process. This model also tackles the challenge of representation bias during optimization by implementing a loss-balancing strategy. Both theoretical analysis and numerical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology significantly outperforms existing self-correlation-based GAEs in graph structure reconstruction.

Graph Diffusion Policy Optimization
Recent research has made significant progress in optimizing diffusion models for downstream objectives, which is an important pursuit in fields such as graph generation for drug design. However, directly applying these models to graph presents challenges, resulting in suboptimal performance. This paper introduces graph diffusion policy optimization (GDPO), a novel approach to optimize graph diffusion models for arbitrary (e.g., non-differentiable) objectives using reinforcement learning. GDPO is based on an eager policy gradient tailored for graph diffusion models, developed through meticulous analysis and promising improved performance. Experimental results show that GDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance in various graph generation tasks with complex and diverse objectives.

Graph Diffusion Transformer for Multi-Conditional Molecular Generation
Inverse molecular design with diffusion models holds great potential for advancements in material and drug discovery. Despite success in unconditional molecule generation, integrating multiple properties such as synthetic score and gas permeability as condition constraints into diffusion models remains unexplored. We present the Graph Diffusion Transformer (Graph DiT) for multi-conditional molecular generation. Graph DiT has a condition encoder to learn the representation of numerical and categorical properties and utilizes a Transformer-based graph denoiser to achieve molecular graph denoising under conditions. Unlike previous graph diffusion models that add noise separately on the atoms and bonds in the forward diffusion process, we propose a graph-dependent noise model for training Graph DiT, designed to accurately estimate graph-related noise in molecules. We extensively validate the Graph DiT for multi-conditional polymer and small molecule generation. Results demonstrate our superiority across metrics from distribution learning to condition control for molecular properties. A polymer inverse design task for gas separation with feedback from domain experts further demonstrates its practical utility.

Graph Edit Distance with General Costs Using Neural Set Divergence
Graph Edit Distance (GED) measures the (dis-)similarity between two given graphs in terms of the minimum-cost edit sequence, which transforms one graph to the other.GED is related to other notions of graph similarity, such as graph and subgraph isomorphism, maximum common subgraph, etc. However, the computation of exact GED is NP-Hard, which has recently motivated the design of neural models for GED estimation.However, they do not explicitly account for edit operations with different costs. In response, we propose $\texttt{GraphEdX}$, a neural GED estimator that can work with general costs specified for the four edit operations, viz., edge deletion, edge addition, node deletion, and node addition.We first present GED as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP) that incorporates these four costs.Then, we represent each graph as a set of node and edge embeddings and use them to design a family of neural set divergence surrogates. We replace the QAP terms corresponding to each operation with their surrogates. Computing such neural set divergence requires aligning nodes and edges of the two graphs.We learn these alignments using a Gumbel-Sinkhorn permutation generator, additionally ensuring that the node and edge alignments are consistent with each other. Moreover, these alignments are cognizant of both the presence and absence of edges between node pairs.Through extensive experiments on several datasets, along with a variety of edit cost settings, we show that $\texttt{GraphEdX}$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and heuristics in terms of prediction error.

Graph-enhanced Optimizers for Structure-aware Recommendation Embedding Evolution
Embedding plays a key role in modern recommender systems because they are virtual representations of real-world entities and the foundation for subsequent decision-making models.  In this paper, we propose a novel embedding update mechanism, Structure-aware Embedding Evolution (SEvo for short), to encourage related nodes to evolve similarly at each step. Unlike GNN (Graph Neural Network) that typically serves as an intermediate module, SEvo is able to directly inject graph structural information into embedding with minimal computational overhead during training.  The convergence properties of SEvo along with its potential variants are theoretically analyzed to justify the validity of the designs.  Moreover, SEvo can be seamlessly integrated into existing optimizers for state-of-the-art performance. Particularly SEvo-enhanced AdamW with moment estimate correction demonstrates consistent improvements across a spectrum of models and datasets, suggesting a novel technical route to effectively utilize graph structural information beyond explicit GNN modules.

GraphMorph: Tubular Structure Extraction by Morphing Predicted Graphs
Accurately restoring topology is both challenging and crucial in tubular structure extraction tasks, such as blood vessel segmentation and road network extraction. Diverging from traditional approaches based on pixel-level classification, our proposed method, named GraphMorph, focuses on branch-level features of tubular structures to achieve more topologically accurate predictions. GraphMorph comprises two main components: a Graph Decoder and a Morph Module. Utilizing multi-scale features extracted from an image patch by the segmentation network, the Graph Decoder facilitates the learning of branch-level features and generates a graph that accurately represents the tubular structure in this patch. The Morph Module processes two primary inputs: the graph and the centerline probability map, provided by the Graph Decoder and the segmentation network, respectively. Employing a novel SkeletonDijkstra algorithm, the Morph Module produces a centerline mask that aligns with the predicted graph. Furthermore, we observe that employing centerline masks predicted by GraphMorph significantly reduces false positives in the segmentation task, which is achieved by a simple yet effective post-processing strategy. The efficacy of our method in the centerline extraction and segmentation tasks has been substantiated through experimental evaluations across various datasets. Source code will be released soon.

Graph Neural Networks and Arithmetic Circuits
We characterize the computational power of neural networks that follow the graph neural network (GNN) architecture, not restricted to aggregate-combine GNNs or other particular types. We establish an exact correspondence between the expressivity of GNNs using diverse activation functions and arithmetic circuits over real numbers. In our results the activation function of the network becomes a gate type in the circuit.  Our result holds for families of constant depth circuits and networks, both uniformly and non-uniformly, for all common activation functions.

Graph neural networks and non-commuting operators
Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of tasks which typically involve predicting features at the nodes of a graph. They are built from layers of graph convolutions which serve as a powerful inductive bias for describing the flow of information among the vertices. Often, more than one data modality is available. This work considers a setting in which several graphs have the same vertex set and a common node-level learning task. This generalizes standard GNN models to GNNs with several graph operators that do not commute. We may call this model graph-tuple neural networks (GtNN). In this work, we develop the mathematical theory to address the stability and transferability of GtNNs using properties of non-commuting non-expansive operators. We develop a limit theory of graphon-tuple neural networks and use it to prove a universal transferability theorem that guarantees that all graph-tuple neural networks are transferable on convergent graph-tuple sequences. In particular, there is no non-transferable energy under the convergence we consider here. Our theoretical results extend well-known transferability theorems for GNNs to the case of several simultaneous graphs (GtNNs) and provide a strict improvement on what is currently known even in the GNN case.We illustrate our theoretical results with simple experiments on synthetic data. To this end, we derive a training procedure that provably enforces the stability of the resulting model.

Graph Neural Networks Do Not Always Oversmooth
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing relational data in applications. However, GNNs suffer from the problem of oversmoothing, the property that features of all nodes exponentially converge to the same vector over layers, prohibiting the design of deep GNNs. In this work we study oversmoothing in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by using their Gaussian process (GP) equivalence in the limit of infinitely many hidden features. By generalizing methods from conventional deep neural networks (DNNs), we can describe the distribution of features at the output layer of deep GCNs in terms of a GP: as expected, we find that typical parameter choices from the literature lead to oversmoothing. The theory, however, allows us to identify a new, non-oversmoothing phase: if the initial weights of the network have sufficiently large variance, GCNs do not oversmooth, and node features remain informative even at large depth. We demonstrate the validity of this prediction in finite-size GCNs by training a linear classifier on their output. Moreover, using the linearization of the GCN GP, we generalize the concept of propagation depth of information from DNNs to GCNs. This propagation depth diverges at the transition between the oversmoothing and non-oversmoothing phase. We test the predictions of our approach and find good agreement with finite-size GCNs. Initializing GCNs near the transition to the non-oversmoothing phase, we obtain networks which are both deep and expressive.

Graph Neural Networks Need Cluster-Normalize-Activate Modules
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are non-Euclidean deep learning models for graph-structured data. Despite their successful and diverse applications, oversmoothing prohibits deep architectures due to node features converging to a single fixed point. This severely limits their potential to solve complex tasks. To counteract this tendency, we propose a plug-and-play module consisting of three steps: Cluster→Normalize→Activate (CNA). By applying CNA modules, GNNs search and form super nodes in each layer, which are normalized and activated individually. We demonstrate in node classification and property prediction tasks that CNA significantly improves the accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Particularly, CNA reaches 94.18% and 95.75% accuracy on Cora and Citeseer, respectively. It further benefits GNNs in regression tasks as well, reducing the mean squared error compared to all baselines. At the same time, GNNs with CNA require substantially fewer learnable parameters than competing architectures.

Graph Structure Inference with BAM: Introducing the Bilinear Attention Mechanism
Detecting dependencies among variables is a fundamental task across all scientific disciplines. In this work, we propose a novel neural network model for supervised graph structure inference, which aims to learn a mapping between observational data and their underlying dependence structure. The model is trained with variably shaped and coupled simulated input data and requires only a single forward pass through the trained network for inference. We introduce a novel bilinear attention mechanism (BAM) for explicit processing of dependency information, which operates on the level of covariance matrices of transformed data and respects the geometry of the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the robustness of our method in detecting a wide range of dependencies, excelling in undirected graph estimation and proving competitive in completed partially directed acyclic graph estimation through a novel two-step approach. The trained model demonstrates the ability to detect the presence of a causal relationships, regardless of their specific parameterizations.

GraphTrail: Translating GNN Predictions into Human-Interpretable Logical Rules
Instance-level explanation of GNNs is a well-studied area. These explainers, however, only explain an instance (e.g., a graph) and fail to uncover the combinatorial reasoning learned by a GNN from the training data towards making its predictions. In this work, we introduce GraphTrail, the first end-to-end global GNN explainer that translates the functioning of a black-box GNN model to a boolean formula over the (sub)graph level concepts without relying on local explainers. GraphTrail, is unique in automatically mining the discriminative subgraph level concepts using Shapley values. Subsequently, the GNN predictions are mapped to a human-interpretable boolean formula over these concepts through symbolic regression. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and GNN architectures demonstrate significant improvement over existing global explainers in mapping GNN predictions to faithful logical formulas. The robust and accurate performance of GraphTrail makes it an invaluable diagnostic tool for refining GNNs and facilitates their adoption in domains with strict transparency requirements.

GraphVis: Boosting LLMs with Visual Knowledge Graph Integration
The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities across various data modalities, extending from well-established image data to increasingly popular graph data. Given the limitation of LLMs in hallucinations and inaccuracies in recalling factual knowledge, Knowledge Graph (KG) has emerged as a crucial data modality to support more accurate reasoning by LLMs. However, integrating structured knowledge from KGs into LLMs remains challenging, as most current KG-enhanced LLM methods directly convert the KG into linearized text triples, which is not as expressive as the original structured data. To address this, we introduce GraphVis, which conserves the intricate graph structure through the visual modality to enhance the comprehension of KGs with the aid of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). Our approach incorporates a unique curriculum fine-tuning scheme which first instructs LVLMs to recognize basic graphical features from the images, and subsequently incorporates reasoning on QA tasks with the visual graphs. This cross-modal methodology not only markedly enhances performance on standard textual QA  but also shows improved zero-shot VQA performance by utilizing synthetic graph images to augment the data for VQA tasks. We present comprehensive evaluations across commonsense reasoning QA benchmarks, where GraphVis provides an average improvement of 11.1% over its base model and outperforms existing KG-enhanced LLM approaches. Across VQA benchmarks such as ScienceQA that share similar scientific diagram images, GraphVis provides a notable gain of 4.32%.

Great Minds Think Alike: The Universal Convergence Trend of Input Salience
Uncertainty is introduced in optimized DNNs through stochastic algorithms, forming specific distributions. Training models can be seen as random sampling from this distribution of optimized models. In this work, we study the distribution of optimized DNNs as a family of functions by leveraging a pointwise approach. We focus on the input saliency maps, as the input gradient field is decisive to the models' mathematical essence. Our investigation of saliency maps reveals a counter-intuitive trend: two stochastically optimized models tend to resemble each other more as either of their capacities increases. Therefore, we hypothesize several properties of these distributions, suggesting that (1) Within the same model architecture (e.g., CNNs, ResNets), different family variants (e.g., varying capacities) tend to align in terms of their population mean directions of the input salience. And (2) the distributions of optimized models follow a convergence trend to their shared population mean as the capacity increases. Furthermore, we also propose semi-parametric distributions based on the Saw distribution to model the convergence trend, satisfying all the counter-intuitive observations. Our experiments shed light on the significant implications of our hypotheses in various application domains, including black-box attacks, deep ensembles, etc. These findings not only enhance our understanding of DNN behaviors but also offer valuable insights for their practical application in diverse areas of deep learning.

GREAT Score: Global Robustness Evaluation of Adversarial Perturbation using Generative Models
Current studies on adversarial robustness mainly focus on aggregating \textit{local} robustness results from a set of data samples to evaluate and rank different models. However, the local statistics may not well represent the true \textit{global} robustness of the underlying unknown data distribution. To address this challenge, this paper makes the first attempt to present a new framework, called \textit{GREAT Score}, for global robustness evaluation of adversarial perturbation using generative models. Formally, GREAT Score carries the physical meaning of a global statistic capturing a mean certified attack-proof perturbation level over all samples drawn from a generative model. For finite-sample evaluation, we also derive a probabilistic guarantee on the sample complexity and the difference between the sample mean and the true mean. GREAT Score has several advantages: (1) Robustness evaluations using GREAT Score are efficient and scalable to large models, by sparing the need of running adversarial attacks. In particular, we show high correlation and significantly reduced computation cost of GREAT Score when compared to the attack-based model ranking on RobustBench \cite{croce2021robustbench}. (2) The use of generative models facilitates the approximation of the unknown data distribution. In our ablation study with different generative adversarial networks (GANs), we observe consistency between global robustness evaluation and the quality of GANs. (3) GREAT Score can be used for remote auditing of privacy-sensitive black-box models, as demonstrated by our robustness evaluation on several online facial recognition services.

Grokked Transformers are Implicit Reasoners: A Mechanistic Journey to the Edge of Generalization
We study whether transformers can learn to *implicitly* reason over parametric knowledge, a skill that even the most capable language models struggle with. Focusing on two representative reasoning types, composition and comparison, we consistently find that transformers *can* learn implicit reasoning, but only through *grokking*, i.e., extended training far beyond overfitting. The levels of generalization also vary across reasoning types: when faced with out-of-distribution examples, transformers fail to systematically generalize for composition but succeed for comparison. We delve into the model's internals throughout training, conducting analytical experiments that reveal: 1) the mechanism behind grokking, such as the formation of the generalizing circuit and its relation to the relative efficiency of generalizing and memorizing circuits, and 2) the connection between systematicity and the configuration of the generalizing circuit. Our findings guide data and training setup to better induce implicit reasoning and suggest potential improvements to the transformer architecture, such as encouraging cross-layer knowledge sharing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a challenging reasoning task with a large search space, GPT-4-Turbo and Gemini-1.5-Pro based on non-parametric memory fail badly regardless of prompting styles or retrieval augmentation, while a fully grokked transformer can achieve near-perfect accuracy, showcasing the power of parametric memory for complex reasoning.

GrootVL: Tree Topology is All You Need in State Space Model
The state space models, employing recursively propagated features, demonstrate strong representation capabilities comparable to Transformer models and superior efficiency.However, constrained by the inherent geometric constraints of sequences, it still falls short in modeling long-range dependencies.To address this issue, we propose the GrootVL network, which first dynamically generates a tree topology based on spatial relationships and input features.Then, feature propagation is performed based on this graph, thereby breaking the original sequence constraints to achieve stronger representation capabilities.Additionally, we introduce a linear complexity dynamic programming algorithm to enhance long-range interactions without increasing computational cost.GrootVL is a versatile multimodal framework that can be applied to both visual and textual tasks.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing structured state space models on image classification, object detection and segmentation.Besides, by fine-tuning large language models, our approach achieves consistent improvements in multiple textual tasks at minor training cost.

GrounDiT: Grounding Diffusion Transformers via Noisy Image Patch Transplantation
We propose a novel zero-shot bounding-box-based spatial grounding technique for text-to-image generation, leveraging recent Transformer-based diffusion models. Zero-shot spatial grounding has gained significant attention in recent literature due to its diverse applications. Previous methods have attempted to manipulate the latent image during the intermediate reverse diffusion process for grounding. However, a persistent challenge has been creating a latent image patch with the same noise level that fully encodes the target object within the given bounding box size. For the first time, we demonstrate that a Transformer-based diffusion model can generate such a noisy image patch in a separate branch of the generation process. This patch is then transplanted into the original image being generated in the main branch. By utilizing the flexibility of Transformers, we generate both a smaller image and a conventional-sized image simultaneously, allowing them to become semantic clones while maintaining realism. At each denoising step, the noisy image patch is copied into the bounding box of the original image, resulting in robust spatial grounding. In our experiments with the HRS and DrawBench benchmarks, we achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to previous zero-shot spatial grounding methods.

Group-wise oracle-efficient algorithms for online multi-group learning
We study the problem of online multi-group learning, a learning model in which an online learner must simultaneously achieve small prediction regret on a large collection of (possibly overlapping) subsequences corresponding to a family of groups. Groups are subsets of the context space, and in fairness applications, they may correspond to subpopulations defined by expressive functions of demographic attributes. In this paper, we design such oracle-efficient algorithms with sublinear regret under a variety of settings, including: (i) the i.i.d. setting, (ii) the adversarial setting with smoothed context distributions, and (iii) the adversarial transductive setting.

GSDF: 3DGS Meets SDF for Improved Neural Rendering and Reconstruction
Representing 3D scenes from multiview images remains a core challenge in computer vision and graphics, requiring both reliable rendering and reconstruction, which often conflicts due to the mismatched prioritization of image quality over precise underlying scene geometry. Although both neural implicit surfaces and explicit Gaussian primitives have advanced with neural rendering techniques, current methods impose strict constraints on density fields or primitive shapes, which enhances the affinity for geometric reconstruction at the sacrifice of rendering quality. To address this dilemma, we introduce GSDF, a dual-branch architecture combining 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF). Our approach leverages mutual guidance and joint supervision during the training process to mutually enhance reconstruction and rendering. Specifically, our method guides the Gaussian primitives to locate near potential surfaces and accelerates the SDF convergence. This implicit mutual guidance ensures robustness and accuracy in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method boosts the SDF optimization process to reconstruct more detailed geometry, while reducing floaters and blurry edge artifacts in rendering by aligning Gaussian primitives with the underlying geometry.

GTA: Generative Trajectory Augmentation with Guidance for Offline Reinforcement Learning
Offline Reinforcement Learning (Offline RL) presents challenges of learning effective decision-making policies from static datasets without any online interactions. Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce GTA, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms in both dense and sparse reward settings. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GTA/

Guided Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Model-based Optimization
Optimizing complex and high-dimensional black-box functions is ubiquitous in science and engineering fields. Unfortunately, the online evaluation of these functions is restricted due to time and safety constraints in most cases. In offline model-based optimization (MBO), we aim to find a design that maximizes the target function using only a pre-existing offline dataset. While prior methods consider forward or inverse approaches to address the problem, these approaches are limited by conservatism and the difficulty of learning highly multi-modal mappings. Recently, there has been an emerging paradigm of learning to improve solutions with synthetic trajectories constructed from the offline dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional generative modeling approach to produce trajectories toward high-scoring regions. First, we construct synthetic trajectories toward high-scoring regions using the dataset while injecting locality bias for consistent improvement directions. Then, we train a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories conditioned on their scores. Lastly, we sample multiple trajectories from the trained model with guidance to explore high-scoring regions beyond the dataset and select high-fidelity designs among generated trajectories with the proxy function. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive baselines on Design-Bench and its practical variants. The code is publicly available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GTG-0D03/.

Guiding a Diffusion Model with a Bad Version of Itself
The primary axes of interest in image-generating diffusion models are image quality, the amount of variation in the results, and how well the results align with a given condition, e.g., a class label or a text prompt. The popular classifier-free guidance approach uses an unconditional model to guide a conditional model, leading to simultaneously better prompt alignment and higher-quality images at the cost of reduced variation. These effects seem inherently entangled, and thus hard to control. We make the surprising observation that it is possible to obtain disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation by guiding generation using a smaller, less-trained version of the model itself rather than an unconditional model. This leads to significant improvements in ImageNet generation, setting record FIDs of 1.01 for 64x64 and 1.25 for 512x512, using publicly available networks. Furthermore, the method is also applicable to unconditional diffusion models, drastically improving their quality.

HairDiffusion: Vivid Multi-Colored Hair Editing via Latent Diffusion
Hair editing is a critical image synthesis task that aims to edit hair color and hairstyle using text descriptions or reference images, while preserving irrelevant attributes (e.g., identity, background, cloth). Many existing methods are based on StyleGAN to address this task. However, due to the limited spatial distribution of StyleGAN, it struggles with multiple hair color editing and facial preservation. Considering the advancements in diffusion models, we utilize Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for hairstyle editing. Our approach introduces Multi-stage Hairstyle Blend (MHB), effectively separating control of hair color and hairstyle in diffusion latent space. Additionally, we train a warping module to align the hair color with the target region. To further enhance multi-color hairstyle editing, we fine-tuned a CLIP model using a multi-color hairstyle dataset. Our method not only tackles the complexity of multi-color hairstyles but also addresses the challenge of preserving original colors during diffusion editing. Extensive experiments showcase the superiority of our method in editing multi-color hairstyles while preserving facial attributes given textual descriptions and reference images.

HairFastGAN: Realistic and Robust Hair Transfer with a Fast Encoder-Based Approach
Our paper addresses the complex task of transferring a hairstyle from a reference image to an input photo for virtual hair try-on. This task is challenging due to the need to adapt to various photo poses, the sensitivity of hairstyles, and the lack of objective metrics. The current state of the art hairstyle transfer methods use an optimization process for different parts of the approach, making them inexcusably slow. At the same time, faster encoder-based models are of very low quality because they either operate in StyleGAN's W+ space or use other low-dimensional image generators. Additionally, both approaches have a problem with hairstyle transfer when the source pose is very different from the target pose, because they either don't consider the pose at all or deal with it inefficiently. In our paper, we present the HairFast model, which uniquely solves these problems and achieves high resolution, near real-time performance, and superior reconstruction compared to optimization problem-based methods. Our solution includes a new architecture operating in the FS latent space of StyleGAN, an enhanced inpainting approach, and improved encoders for better alignment, color transfer, and a new encoder for post-processing. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on realism metrics after random hairstyle transfer and reconstruction when the original hairstyle is transferred. In the most difficult scenario of transferring both shape and color of a hairstyle from different images, our method performs in less than a second on the Nvidia V100.

Hallo3D: Multi-Modal Hallucination Detection and Mitigation for Consistent 3D Content Generation
Recent advancements in 3D content generation have been significant, primarily due to the visual priors provided by pretrained diffusion models. However, large 2D visual models exhibit spatial perception hallucinations, leading to multi-view inconsistency in 3D content generated through Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). This phenomenon, characterized by overfitting to specific views, is referred to as the "Janus Problem". In this work, we investigate the hallucination issues of pretrained models and find that large multimodal models without geometric constraints possess the capability to infer geometric structures, which can be utilized to mitigate multi-view inconsistency. Building on this, we propose a novel tuning-free method. We represent the multimodal inconsistency query information to detect specific hallucinations in 3D content, using this as an enhanced prompt to re-consist the 2D renderings of 3D and jointly optimize the structure and appearance across different views. Our approach does not require 3D training data and can be implemented plug-and-play within existing frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the consistency of 3D content generation and specifically mitigates hallucinations caused by pretrained large models, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other optimization methods.

Hamiltonian Score Matching and Generative Flows
Classical Hamiltonian mechanics has been widely used in machine learning in the form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for applications with predetermined force fields. In this paper, we explore the potential of deliberately designing force fields for Hamiltonian systems, introducing Hamiltonian velocity predictors (HVPs) as a core tool for constructing energy-based and generative models. We present two innovations: Hamiltonian Score Matching (HSM), which utilizes score functions to augment data by simulating Hamiltonian trajectories, and Hamiltonian Generative Flows (HGFs), a novel generative model that encompasses diffusion models and OT-flow matching as HGFs with zero force fields. We showcase the extended design space of force fields by introducing Oscillation HGFs, a generative model inspired by harmonic oscillators. Our experiments demonstrate that HSM and HGFs rival leading score-matching and generative modeling techniques. Overall, our work systematically elucidates the synergy between Hamiltonian dynamics, force fields, and generative models, thereby opening new avenues for applications of machine learning in physical sciences and dynamical systems.

Handling Learnwares from Heterogeneous Feature Spaces with Explicit Label Exploitation
The learnware paradigm aims to help users leverage numerous existing high-performing models instead of starting from scratch, where the learnware consists of a well-trained model and the specification describing its capability. Generally, previous studies assumed shared feature spaces for all models and user tasks, but in reality, feature spaces often differ. If the learnware paradigm can handle this scenario, \textit{many heterogeneous models built for a task can be identified and reused for a new user task}. In this paper, we find that \textit{label information}, including model prediction and user's minor labeled data, is crucial and previously unexplored. We explicitly explore this information to address the problem. This paper proposes a new specification that encodes model capabilities and enhances subspace learning for better learnware management. It also recommends considering the conditional distributions with label information to improve learnware recommendations. Extensive experiments show that the recommended heterogeneous learnware significantly outperforms user self-training with limited labeled data and continues to enhance performance as more labeled data becomes available.

Happy: A Debiased Learning Framework for Continual Generalized Category Discovery
Constantly discovering novel concepts is crucial in evolving environments. This paper explores the underexplored task of Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD), which aims to incrementally discover new classes from *unlabeled* data while maintaining the ability to recognize previously learned classes. Although several settings are proposed to study the C-GCD task, they have limitations that do not reflect real-world scenarios. We thus study a more practical C-GCD setting, which includes more new classes to be discovered over a longer period, without storing samples of past classes. In C-GCD, the model is initially trained on labeled data of known classes, followed by multiple incremental stages where the model is fed with unlabeled data containing both old and new classes. The core challenge involves two conflicting objectives: discover new classes and prevent forgetting old ones. We delve into the conflicts and identify that models are susceptible to *prediction bias* and *hardness bias*. To address these issues, we introduce a debiased learning framework namely **Happy**. For the *prediction bias*, we first introduce clustering-guided initialization to provide robust features. In addition, we propose soft entropy regularization to assign appropriate probabilities to new classes, which can significantly enhance the clustering performance of new classes. For the *harness bias*, we present the hardness-aware prototype sampling, which can effectively reduce the forgetting issue for previously seen classes, especially for difficult classes. Experimental results demonstrate our method proficiently manages the conflicts of C-GCD and achieves remarkable performance across various datasets, e.g., 7.5% overall gains on ImageNet-100. Codes will be available.

Hardness of Learning Neural Networks under the Manifold Hypothesis
The manifold hypothesis presumes that high-dimensional data lies on or near a low-dimensional manifold. While the utility of encoding geometric structure has been demonstrated empirically, rigorous analysis of its impact on the learnability of neural networks is largely missing. Several recent results have established hardness results for learning feedforward and equivariant neural networks under i.i.d. Gaussian or uniform Boolean data distributions. In this paper, we investigate the hardness of learning under the manifold hypothesis. We ask, which minimal assumptions on the curvature and regularity of the manifold, if any, render the learning problem efficiently learnable. We prove that learning is hard under input manifolds of bounded curvature by extending proofs of hardness in the SQ and cryptographic settings for boolean data inputs to the geometric setting. On the other hand, we show that additional assumptions on the volume of the data manifold alleviate these fundamental limitations and guarantee learnability via a simple interpolation argument. Notable instances of this regime are manifolds which can be reliably reconstructed via manifold learning. Looking forward, we comment on and empirically explore intermediate regimes of manifolds, which have heterogeneous features commonly found in real world data.

Harnessing small projectors and multiple views for efficient vision pretraining
Recent progress in self-supervised (SSL) visual representation learning has led to the development of several different proposed frameworks that rely on augmentations of images but use different loss functions. However, there are few theoretically grounded principles to guide practice, so practical implementation of each SSL framework requires several heuristics to achieve competitive performance.In this work, we build on recent analytical results to design practical recommendations for competitive and efficient SSL that are grounded in theory. Specifically, recent theory tells us that existing SSL frameworks are actually minimizing the same idealized loss, which is to learn features that best match the data similarity kernel defined by the augmentations used.We show how this idealized loss can be reformulated to a functionally equivalent loss that is more efficient to compute.We study the implicit bias of using gradient descent to minimize our reformulated loss function, and find that using a stronger orthogonalization constraint with a reduced projector dimensionality should yield good representations.Furthermore, the theory tells us that approximating the reformulated loss should be improved by increasing the number of augmentations, and as such using multiple augmentations should lead to improved convergence.We empirically verify our findings on CIFAR, STL and Imagenet datasets, wherein we demonstrate an improved linear readout performance when training a ResNet-backbone using our theoretically grounded recommendations.  Remarkably, we also demonstrate that by leveraging these insights, we can reduce the pretraining dataset size by up to 2$\times$ while maintaining downstream accuracy simply by using more data augmentations. Taken together, our work provides theoretically grounded recommendations that can be used to improve SSL convergence and efficiency.

HC-GAE: The Hierarchical Cluster-based Graph Auto-Encoder for Graph Representation Learning
Graph Auto-Encoders (GAEs) are powerful tools for graph representation learning. In this paper, we develop a novel Hierarchical Cluster-based GAE (HC-GAE), that can learn effective structural characteristics for graph data analysis. To this end, during the encoding process, we commence by utilizing the hard node assignment to decompose a sample graph into a family of separated subgraphs. We compress each subgraph into a coarsened node, transforming the original graph into a coarsened graph. On the other hand, during the decoding process, we adopt the soft node assignment to reconstruct the original graph structure by expanding the coarsened nodes. By hierarchically performing the above compressing procedure during the decoding process as well as the expanding procedure during the decoding process, the proposed HC-GAE can effectively extract bidirectionally hierarchical structural features of the original sample graph. Furthermore, we re-design the loss function that can integrate the information from either the encoder or the decoder. Since the associated graph convolution operation of the proposed HC-GAE is restricted in each individual separated subgraph and cannot propagate the node information between different subgraphs, the proposed HC-GAE can significantly reduce the over-smoothing problem arising in the classical convolution-based GAEs. The proposed HC-GAE can generate effective representations for either node classification or graph classification, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness on real-world datasets.

HEALNet: Multimodal Fusion for Heterogeneous Biomedical Data
Technological advances in medical data collection, such as high-resolution histopathology and high-throughput genomic sequencing, have contributed to the rising requirement for multi-modal biomedical modelling, specifically for image, tabular, and graph data. Most multi-modal deep learning approaches use modality-specific architectures that are often trained separately and cannot capture the crucial cross-modal information that motivates the integration of different data sources. This paper presents the Hybrid Early-fusion Attention Learning Network (HEALNet) – a flexible multi-modal fusion architecture, which a) preserves modality-specific structural information, b) captures the cross-modal interactions and structural information in a shared latent space, c) can effectively handle missing modalities during training and inference, and d) enables intuitive model inspection by learning on the raw data input instead of opaque embeddings. We conduct multi-modal survival analysis on Whole Slide Images and Multi-omic data on four cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). HEALNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially improving over uni-modal and multi-modal fusion baselines whilst being robust in scenarios with missing modalities.

Heavy-Tailed Class Imbalance and Why Adam Outperforms Gradient Descent on Language Models
Adam has been shown to outperform gradient descent on large language models by a larger margin than on other tasks, but it is unclear why. We show that a key factor in this performance gap is the heavy-tailed class imbalance found in language tasks. When trained with gradient descent, the loss of infrequent words decreases more slowly than the loss of frequent ones. This leads to a slow decrease on the average loss as most samples come from infrequent words. On the other hand, Adam and sign-based methods are less sensitive to this problem. To establish that this behavior is caused by class imbalance, we show empirically that it can be reproduced across architectures and data types, on language transformers, vision CNNs, and linear models. On a linear model with cross-entropy loss, we show that class imbalance leads to imbalanced, correlated gradients and Hessians that have been hypothesized to benefit Adam. We also prove that, in continuous time, gradient descent converges slowly on low-frequency classes while sign descent does not.

HGDL: Heterogeneous Graph Label Distribution Learning
Label Distribution Learning (LDL) has been commonly studied in computer visionand many other IID data applications, due to its more generic setting than single-label and multi-label classification. This paper advances LDL into graph domainsand aims to tackle a novel heterogeneous graph label distribution learning (HGDL)problem. We argue that the graph heterogeneity reflected on node types, nodeattributes, and neighborhood structures can impose significant challenges for gen-eralizing LDL onto graphs. To address the challenges, we propose a new learningframework with two key components: 1) proactive graph topology homogenization,and 2) topology and content consistency-aware graph transformer. Specifically,the former learns optimal information aggregation between meta-paths, so that thenode heterogeneity can be proactively addressed prior to the succeeding embeddinglearning; the latter uses transformer-like architecture to learn consistency betweenmeta-path and node attributes, allowing network topology and nodal attributes to beequally emphasized during the label distribution learning. By using KL-divergenceand additional constraints, HGDL delivers an end-to-end solution for learning andpredicting label distribution for nodes. Both theoretical and empirical studiessubstantiate the effectiveness of our HGDL approach. Our code and datasets areavailable at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HGDL-D014.

HHD-GP: Incorporating Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition into Gaussian Processes for Learning Dynamical Systems
Machine learning models provide alternatives for efficiently recognizing complex patterns from data, but the main concern in applying them to modeling physical systems stems from their physics-agnostic design, leading to learning methods that lack interpretability, robustness, and data efficiency. This paper mitigates this concern by incorporating the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition into a Gaussian process model, leading to a versatile framework that simultaneously learns the curl-free and divergence-free components of a dynamical system. Learning a predictive model in this form facilitates the exploitation of symmetry priors. In addition to improving predictive power, these priors make the model indentifiable, thus the identified features can be linked to comprehensible scientific properties of the system. We show that compared to baseline models, our model achieves better predictive performance on several benchmark dynamical systems while allowing physically meaningful decomposition of the systems from noisy and sparse data.

HiCo: Hierarchical Controllable Diffusion Model for Layout-to-image Generation
The task of layout-to-image generation involves synthesizing images based on the captions of objects and their spatial positions. Existing methods still struggle in complex layout generation, where common bad cases include object missing, inconsistent lighting, conflicting view angles, etc. To effectively address these issues, we propose a Hierarchical Controllable (HiCo) diffusion model for layout-to-image generation, featuring object seperable conditioning branch structure. Our key insight is to achieve spatial disentanglement through hierarchical modeling of layouts. We use a multi branch structure to represent hierarchy and aggregate them in fusion module. To evaluate the performance of multi-objective controllable layout generation in natural scenes, we introduce the HiCo-7K benchmark, derived from the GRIT-20M dataset and manually cleaned.

Hidden in Plain Sight: Evaluating Abstract Shape Recognition in Vision-Language Models
Despite the importance of shape perception in human vision, early neural image classifiers relied less on shape information for object recognition than other (often spurious) features. While recent research suggests that current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit more reliance on shape, we find them to still be seriously limited in this regard. To quantify such limitations, we introduce a dataset that challenges current cutting-edge VLMs to decipher shape information when the shape is represented by an arrangement of visual elements in a scene. Our extensive evaluations reveal that, while these shapes are easily detectable by human annotators, current VLMs struggle to recognize them, indicating important avenues for future work in developing more robust visual perception systems.

Hierarchical data visualization via PCA trees
We propose a new model for dimensionality reduction, the PCA tree, which works like a regular autoencoder, having explicit projection and reconstruction mappings. The projection is effected by a sparse oblique tree, having hard, hyperplane splits using few features and linear leaves. The reconstruction mapping is a set of local linear mappings. Thus, rather than producing a global map as in t-SNE and other methods, which often leads to distortions, it produces a hierarchical set of local PCAs. The use of a sparse oblique tree and PCA makes the overall model interpretable and very fast to project or reconstruct new points. Joint optimization of all the parameters in the tree is a nonconvex nondifferentiable problem. We propose an algorithm that is guaranteed to decrease the error monotonically and which scales to large datasets without any approximation. In experiments, we show PCA trees are able to identify a wealth of low-dimensional and cluster structure in image and document datasets.

Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein: A Scalable Metric for Heterogeneous Joint Distributions
Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator, i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators, i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison.

Hierarchical Object-Aware Dual-Level Contrastive Learning for Domain Generalized Stereo Matching
Stereo matching algorithms that leverage end-to-end convolutional neural networks have recently demonstrated notable advancements in performance. However, a common issue is their susceptibility to domain shifts, hindering their ability in generalizing to diverse, unseen realistic domains. We argue that existing stereo matching networks overlook the importance of extracting semantically and structurally meaningful features. To address this gap, we propose an effective hierarchical object-aware dual-level contrastive learning (HODC) framework for domain generalized stereo matching. Our framework guides the model in extracting features that support semantically and structurally driven matching by segmenting objects at different scales and enhances correspondence between intra- and inter-scale regions from the left feature map to the right using dual-level contrastive loss. HODC can be integrated with existing stereo matching models in the training stage, requiring no modifications to the architecture. Remarkably, using only synthetic datasets for training, HODC achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance with various existing stereo matching network architectures, across multiple realistic datasets.

Hierarchical Selective Classification
Deploying deep neural networks for risk-sensitive tasks necessitates an uncertainty estimation mechanism. This paper introduces *hierarchical selective classification*, extending selective classification to a hierarchical setting. Our approach leverages the inherent structure of class relationships, enabling models to reduce the specificity of their predictions when faced with uncertainty. In this paper, we first formalize hierarchical risk and coverage, and introduce hierarchical risk-coverage curves. Next, we develop algorithms for hierarchical selective classification (which we refer to as "inference rules"), and propose an efficient algorithm that guarantees a target accuracy constraint with high probability. Lastly, we conduct extensive empirical studies on over a thousand ImageNet classifiers, revealing that training regimes such as CLIP, pretraining on ImageNet21k and knowledge distillation boost hierarchical selective performance.

Hierarchical Uncertainty Exploration via Feedforward Posterior Trees
When solving ill-posed inverse problems, one often desires to explore the space of potential solutions rather than be presented with a single plausible reconstruction. Valuable insights into these feasible solutions and their associated probabilities are embedded in the posterior distribution. However, when confronted with data of high dimensionality (such as images), visualizing this distribution becomes a formidable challenge, necessitating the application of effective summarization techniques before user examination. In this work, we introduce a new approach for visualizing posteriors across multiple levels of granularity using *tree*-valued predictions. Our method predicts a tree-valued hierarchical summarization of the posterior distribution for any input measurement, in a single forward pass of a neural network. We showcase the efficacy of our approach across diverse datasets and image restoration challenges, highlighting its prowess in uncertainty quantification and visualization. Our findings reveal that our method performs comparably to a baseline that hierarchically clusters samples from a diffusion-based posterior sampler, yet achieves this with orders of magnitude greater speed.

High-dimensional (Group) Adversarial Training in Linear Regression
Adversarial training can achieve robustness against adversarial perturbations and has been widely used in machine learning models.This paper delivers a non-asymptotic consistency analysis of the adversarial training procedure under $\ell_\infty$-perturbation in high-dimensional linear regression. It will be shown that the associated convergence rate of prediction error can achieve the minimax rate up to a logarithmic factor in the high-dimensional linear regression on the class of sparse parameters. Additionally, the group adversarial training procedure is analyzed. Compared with classic adversarial training, it will be proved that the group adversarial training procedure enjoys a better prediction error upper bound under certain group-sparsity patterns.

High-probability complexity bounds for stochastic non-convex minimax optimization
Stochastic smooth nonconvex minimax problems are prevalent in machine learning, e.g.,GAN training, fair classification, and distributionally robust learning. Stochastic gradient descent ascent (GDA)-type methods are popular in practice due to their simplicity and single-loop nature. However, there is a significant gap between the theory and practice regarding high-probability complexity guarantees for these methods on stochastic nonconvex minimax problems. Existing high-probability bounds for GDA-type single-loop methods only apply to convex/concave minimax problems and to particular non-monotone variational inequality problems under some restrictive assumptions. In this work, we address this gap by providing the first high-probability complexity guarantees for nonconvex/PL minimax problems corresponding to a smooth function that satisfies the PL-condition in the dual variable. Specifically, we show that when the stochastic gradients are light-tailed, the smoothed alternating GDA method can compute an $\varepsilon$-stationary point within $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\ell \kappa^2 \delta^2}{\varepsilon^4} + \frac{\kappa}{\varepsilon^2}(\ell+\delta^2\log({1}/{\bar{q}})))$ stochastic gradient calls with probability at least $1-\bar{q}$ for any $\bar{q}\in(0,1)$, where $\mu$ is the PL constant, $\ell$ is the Lipschitz constant of the gradient, $\kappa=\ell/\mu$ is the condition number, and $\delta^2$ denotes a bound on the variance of stochastic gradients. We also present numerical results on a nonconvex/PL problem with synthetic data and on distributionally robust optimization problems with real data, illustrating our theoretical findings.

HOI-Swap: Swapping Objects in Videos with Hand-Object Interaction Awareness
We study the problem of precisely swapping objects in videos, with a focus on those interacted with by hands, given one user-provided reference object image. Despite the great advancements that diffusion models have made in video editing recently, these models often fall short in handling the intricacies of hand-object interactions (HOI), failing to produce realistic edits---especially when object swapping results in object shape or functionality changes. To bridge this gap, we present HOI-Swap, a novel diffusion-based video editing framework trained in a self-supervised manner.  Designed in two stages, the first stage focuses on object swapping in a single frame with HOI awareness; the model learns to adjust the interaction patterns, such as the hand grasp, based on changes in the object's properties. The second stage extends the single-frame edit across the entire sequence; we achieve controllable motion alignment with the original video by: (1) warping a new sequence from the stage-I edited frame based on sampled motion points and (2) conditioning video generation on the warped sequence. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that HOI-Swap significantly outperforms existing methods, delivering high-quality video edits with realistic HOIs.

Hollowed Net for On-Device Personalization of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the personalization of such models to generate custom images from textual prompts. This paper presents an efficient LoRA personalization approach for on-device subject-driven generation, where pre-trained diffusion models are fine-tuned with user-specific data on resource-constrained devices. Our method, termed the Hollowed Net, significantly enhances the memory efficiency in fine-tuning stage by modifying the architecture of a diffusion U-Net such that non-essential deep layers are removed-creating a hollowed structure. We directly address the on-device memory constraints, and our Hollowed Net is beneficial for considerably reducing the training GPU memory, while previous methods mostly focus on minimizing training steps and the parameters to update. Additionally, our personalized Hollowed Net can be transferred back into the original U-Net, enabling the inference without additional memory requirements. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the training memory to the level as low as that required for inference, but also maintains or improves the personalization performance compared to existing methods.

HOPE: Shape Matching Via Aligning Different K-hop Neighbourhoods
Accurate and smooth shape matching is very hard to achieve. This is because for accuracy, one needs unique descriptors (signatures) on shapes that distinguish different vertices on a mesh accurately while at the same time being invariant to deformations. However, most existing unique shape descriptors are generally not smooth on the shape and are not noise-robust thus leading to non-smooth matches. On the other hand, for smoothness, one needs descriptors that are smooth and continuous on the shape. However, existing smooth descriptors are generally not unique and as such lose accuracy as they match neighborhoods (for smoothness) rather than exact vertices (for accuracy). In this work, we propose to use different k-hop neighborhoods of vertices as pairwise descriptors for shape matching. We use these descriptors in conjunction with local map distortion (LMD) to refine an initialized map for shape matching. We validate the effectiveness of our pipeline on benchmark datasets such as SCAPE, TOSCA, TOPKIDS, and others.

How Control Information Influences Multilingual Text Image Generation and Editing?
Visual text generation has significantly advanced through diffusion models aimed at producing images with readable and realistic text. Recent works primarily use a ControlNet-based framework, employing standard font text images to control diffusion models. Recognizing the critical role of control information in generating high-quality text, we investigate its influence from three perspectives: input encoding, role at different stages, and output features. Our findings reveal that: 1) Input control information has unique characteristics compared to conventional inputs like Canny edges and depth maps. 2) Control information plays distinct roles at different stages of the denoising process. 3) Output control features significantly differ from the base and skip features of the U-Net decoder in the frequency domain. Based on these insights, we propose TextGen, a novel framework designed to enhance generation quality by optimizing control information. We improve input and output features using Fourier analysis to emphasize relevant information and reduce noise. Additionally, we employ a two-stage generation framework to align the different roles of control information at different stages. Furthermore, we introduce an effective and lightweight dataset for training. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Chinese and English text generation. The code and dataset will be made available.

How Diffusion Models Learn to Factorize and Compose
Diffusion models are capable of generating photo-realistic images that combine elements which do not appear together in natural images, demonstrating their ability to compositionally generalize. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism of compositionality and how it is acquired through training remains elusive. Here, we consider a highly reduced setting to examine whether diffusion models learn semantically meaningful and fully factorized representations of composable features. We performed extensive controlled experiments on conditional DDPMs trained to generate various forms of 2D Gaussian data. We demonstrate that the models learn factorized, semi-continuous manifold representations that are orthogonal in underlying continuous latent features of independent variations but are not aligned for different values of the same feature. With such representations, models demonstrate superior compositionality but have limited ability to interpolate over unseen values of a given feature. Our experimental results further demonstrate that diffusion models can attain compositionality with a small amount of compositional examples, suggesting a novel way to train DDPMs. Finally, we connect manifold formation in diffusion models to percolation theory in physics, thereby offering insights into the sudden onset of factorized representation learning. Our thorough toy experiments thus contribute a deeper understanding of how diffusion models capture compositional structure in data, paving the way for future research aimed at enhancing factorization and compositional generalization in generative models for real-world applications.

How does Gradient Descent Learn Features --- A Local Analysis for Regularized Two-Layer Neural Networks
The ability of learning useful features is one of the major advantages of neural networks. Although recent works show that neural network can operate in a neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime that does not allow feature learning, many works also demonstrate the potential for neural networks to go beyond NTK regime and perform feature learning. Recently, a line of work highlighted the feature learning capabilities of the early stages of gradient-based training. In this paper we consider another mechanism for feature learning via gradient descent through a local convergence analysis. We show that once the loss is below a certain threshold, gradient descent with a carefully regularized objective will capture ground-truth directions. Our results demonstrate that feature learning not only happens at the initial gradient steps, but can also occur towards the end of training.

How Do Transformers Fill in the Blanks? A Case Study on Matrix Completion
Completing masked sequences is an important problem in language modeling, and analyzing how Transformer models perform this task is crucial for understanding their mechanisms. In this direction, we formulate the low-rank matrix completion problem as a masked language modeling (MLM) task, and train a BERT model to solve this task. We find that BERT succeeds in matrix completion and outperforms the classical nuclear norm minimization method. Moreover, the loss curve displays an early plateau followed by a sudden drop to near-optimal values, despite no changes in the training procedure or hyper-parameters. To gain interpretability insights, we examine the model's predictions, attention heads, and hidden states before and after this transition. Concretely, we observe that (i) the model transitions from simply copying the masked input to accurately predicting the masked entries; (ii) the attention heads transition to interpretable patterns relevant to the task; and (iii) the embeddings and hidden states encode information relevant to the problem.

How Far Can Transformers Reason? The Locality Barrier and Inductive Scratchpad
Can Transformers predict new syllogisms by composing established ones? More generally, what type of targets can be learned by such models from scratch? Recent works show that Transformers can be Turing-complete in terms of expressivity, but this does not address the learnability objective. This paper puts forward the notion of 'distribution locality' to capture when weak learning is efficiently achievable by regular Transformers, where the locality measures the least number of tokens required in addition to the tokens histogram to correlate nontrivially with the target. As shown experimentally and theoretically under additional assumptions, distributions with high locality cannot be learned efficiently. In particular, syllogisms cannot be composed on long chains. Furthermore, we argue that (i) an agnostic scratchpad cannot help to break the locality, (ii) an educated scratchpad can help if it breaks the locality at each step, (iii) a notion of 'inductive scratchpad' can both break the locality and help with out-of-distribution generalization.

How In-Context Learning Emerges from Training on Unstructured Data: The Role of Co-Occurrence, Positional Information, and Noise Structures
Large language models (LLMs) like transformers have impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities; they can generate predictions for new queries based on input-output sequences in prompts without parameter updates. While many theories have attempted to explain ICL, they often focus on structured training data similar to ICL tasks, such as regression. In practice, however, these models are trained in an unsupervised manner on unstructured text data, which bears little resemblance to ICL tasks. To this end, we investigate how ICL emerges from unsupervised training on unstructured data. The key observation is that ICL can arise simply by modeling co-occurrence information using classical language models like continuous bag of words (CBOW), which we prove and empirically validate. Furthermore, we establish the necessity of positional information and noise structure to generalize ICL to unseen data. Finally, we present instances where ICL fails and provide theoretical explanations; they suggest that the ICL ability of LLMs to identify certain tasks can be sensitive to the structure of the training data.

How many classifiers do we need?
As performance gains through scaling data or model size experience diminishing returns, it is becoming increasingly popular to turn to ensembling, where the predictions of multiple models are combined to improve accuracy. We focus on majority vote strategies in classification tasks, and take a deep dive into how the disagreement and the polarity, which we define in this paper, among agents relates to the performance gain achieved by aggregating individual agents. This paper addresses this in the following ways. 1) We define a quantity, $\eta$, that represents the polarity among agents within a dataset, and show both empirically and theoretically that this quantity is nearly constant for a dataset regardless of hyperparameters or architectures of classifiers. 2) We present a tight upper bound for the error of majority vote under restricted entropy conditions. This bound indicates that the disagreement is linearly correlated with the target, and the slope is linear in polarity, $\eta$. 3) We prove asymptotic behavior of disagreement in terms of the number of agents, which can help predicting the performance for a larger number of agents from that of a smaller number. Our theories and claims are supported by experiments on several image classification tasks with various types of neural networks.

How to Continually Adapt Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Flexible Customization?
Custom diffusion models (CDMs) have attracted widespread attention due to their astonishing generative ability for personalized concepts. However, most existing CMDs unreasonably assume that personalized concepts are fixed and cannot change over time. Moreover, they heavily suffer from catastrophic forgetting and concept neglect on old personalized concepts when continually learning a series of new concepts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Concept-Incremental text-to-image Diffusion Model (CIDM), which can resolve catastrophic forgetting and concept neglect to learn new customization tasks in a concept-incremental manner. Specifically, to surmount the catastrophic forgetting of old concepts, we develop a concept consolidation loss and an elastic weight aggregation module. They can explore task-specific and task-shared knowledge during training, and aggregate all low-rank weights of old concepts based on their contributions during inference. Moreover, in order to address concept neglect, we devise a context-controllable synthesis strategy that leverages expressive regional features and noise estimation to control the contexts of generated images according to user conditions. Experiments verify that our CIDM surpasses existing custom diffusion models. Our codes and models will be publicly released.

How to Solve Contextual Goal-Oriented Problems with Offline Datasets?
We present a novel method, Contextual goal-Oriented Data Augmentation (CODA), which uses commonly available unlabeled trajectories and context-goal pairs to solve Contextual Goal-Oriented (CGO) problems. By carefully constructing an action-augmented MDP that is equivalent to the original MDP, CODA creates a fully labeled transition dataset under training contexts without additional approximation error. We conduct a novel theoretical analysis to demonstrate CODA's capability to solve CGO problems with our offline data setup. Empirical results also showcase the effectiveness of CODA, which outperform other baseline methods across various context-goal relationships. This approach offers a promising direction to solving CGO problems using offline datasets.

How to Use Diffusion Priors under Sparse Views?
Novel view synthesis under sparse views has been a long-term important challenge in 3D reconstruction. Existing works mainly rely on introducing external semantic or depth priors to supervise the optimization of 3D representations. However, the diffusion model, as an external prior that can directly provide visual supervision, has always underperformed in sparse-view 3D reconstruction using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) due to the low information entropy of sparse views compared to text, leading to optimization challenges caused by mode deviation. To this end, we present a thorough analysis of SDS from the mode-seeking perspective and propose Inline Prior Guided Score Matching (IPSM), which leverages visual inline priors provided by pose relationships between viewpoints to rectify the rendered image distribution and decomposes the original optimization objective of SDS, thereby offering effective diffusion visual guidance without any fine-tuning or pre-training. Furthermore, we propose the IPSM-Gaussian pipeline, which adopts 3D Gaussian Splatting as the backbone and supplements depth and geometry consistency regularization based on IPSM to further improve inline priors and rectified distribution. Experimental results on different public datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

How Transformers Utilize Multi-Head Attention in In-Context Learning? A Case Study on Sparse Linear Regression
Despite the remarkable success of transformer-based models in various real-world tasks, their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent studies have suggested that transformers can implement gradient descent as an in-context learner for linear regression problems and have developed various theoretical analyses accordingly. However, these works mostly focus on the expressive power of transformers by designing specific parameter constructions, lacking a comprehensive understanding of their inherent working mechanisms post-training. In this study, we consider a sparse linear regression problem and investigate how a trained multi-head transformer performs in-context learning. We experimentally discover that the utilization of multi-heads exhibits different patterns across layers: multiple heads are utilized and essential in the first layer, while usually only a single head is sufficient for subsequent layers. We provide a theoretical explanation for this observation: the first layer preprocesses the context data, and the following layers execute simple optimization steps based on the preprocessed context. Moreover, we demonstrate that such a preprocess-then-optimize algorithm can significantly outperform naive gradient descent and ridge regression algorithms. Further experimental results support our explanations. Our findings offer insights into the benefits of multi-head attention and contribute to understanding the more intricate mechanisms hidden within trained transformers.

Human 3Diffusion: Realistic Avatar Creation via Explicit 3D Consistent Diffusion Models
Creating realistic avatars from a single RGB image is an attractive yet challenging problem. Due to its ill-posed nature, recent works leverage powerful prior from 2D diffusion models pre-trained on large datasets. Although 2D diffusion models demonstrate strong generalization capability, they cannot provide multi-view shape priors with the guaranteed 3D consistency. We propose Human 3Diffusion: Realistic Avatar Creation via Explicit 3D consistent diffusion. Our key insight is that 2D multi-view diffusion and 3D reconstruction models provide complementary information for each other, and by coupling them in a tight manner, we can fully leverage the potential of both models.  We introduce a novel image-conditioned generative 3D Gaussian Splats reconstruction model that leverages the priors from 2D multi-view diffusion models, and provides an explicit 3D representation, which further guide the 2D reverse sampling process to have better 3D consistency. Experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and enables the creation of realistic avatars from a single RGB image, achieving high-fidelity in both geometry and appearance. Extensive ablations also validate the efficacy of our design, (1) multi-view 2D priors conditioning in generative 3D reconstruction and (2) consistency refinement of sampling trajectory via the explicit 3D representation.  Our code and models will be released.

Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation: Bridging Simulation to Reality with Dynamic Human Interactions
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to develop embodied agents that navigate based on human instructions. However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions. We propose the Human-Aware 3D (HA3D) simulator, which combines dynamic human activities with the Matterport3D dataset, and the Human-Aware Room-to-Room (HA-R2R) dataset, extending R2R with human activity descriptions. To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability. Ultimately, this work provides benchmarks and insights for future research on embodied AI and Sim2Real transfer, paving the way for more realistic and applicable VLN systems in human-populated environments.

HumanSplat: Generalizable Single-Image Human Gaussian Splatting with Structure Priors
Despite recent advancements in high-fidelity human reconstruction techniques, the requirements for densely captured images or time-consuming per-instance optimization significantly hinder their applications in broader scenarios. To tackle these issues, we present HumanSplat which predicts 3D Gaussian Splatting properties of any unseen human body from a single input image in a generalizable manner. In particular, HumanSplat is composed of a 2D multi-view diffusion model and a latent reconstruction transformer with human structure priors that adeptly integrate geometric priors and semantic features within a unified framework. A hierarchical loss that incorporates human semantic priors is designed to achieve high-fidelity texture modeling and better constrain the estimated multiple views. Comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks, such as Thuman2.0 datasets demonstrate that HumanSplat surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in achieving photorealistic novel-view synthesis.

HumanVLA: Towards Vision-Language Directed Object Rearrangement by Physical Humanoid
Physical Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) plays a crucial role in numerous applications.     However, existing HSI techniques are limited to specific object dynamics and privileged information, which prevents the development of more comprehensive applications.    To address this limitation, we introduce HumanVLA for general object rearrangement directed by practical vision and language.     A teacher-student framework is utilized to develop HumanVLA.    A state-based teacher policy is trained first using goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and adversarial motion prior.    Then, it is distilled into a vision-language-action model via behavior cloning.    We propose several key insights to facilitate the large-scale learning process.    To support general object rearrangement by physical humanoid, we introduce a novel Human-in-the-Room dataset encompassing various rearrangement tasks.    Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

HW-GPT-Bench: Hardware-Aware Architecture Benchmark for Language Models
The increasing size of language models necessitates a thorough analysis across multiple dimensions to assess trade-offs among crucial hardware metrics such as latency, energy consumption, GPU memory usage, and performance. Identifying optimal model configurations under specific hardware constraints is becoming essential but remains challenging due to the computational load of exhaustive training and evaluation on multiple devices. To address this, we introduce HW-GPT-Bench, a hardware-aware benchmark that utilizes surrogate predictions to approximate various hardware metrics across 13 devices of architectures in the GPT-2 family, with architectures containing up to 774M parameters. Our surrogates, via calibrated predictions and reliable uncertainty estimates, faithfully model the heteroscedastic noise inherent in the energy and latency measurements. To estimate perplexity, we employ weight-sharing techniques from Neural Architecture Search (NAS), inheriting pretrained weights from the largest GPT-2 model. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of HW-GPT-Bench by simulating optimization trajectories of various multi-objective optimization algorithms in just a few seconds.

Hybrid Global Causal Discovery with Local Search
Learning the unique directed acyclic graph corresponding to an unknown causal model is a challenging task. Methods based on functional causal models can identify a unique graph, but either suffer from the curse of dimensionality or impose strong parametric assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid approach for global causal discovery in observational data that leverages local causal substructures. We first present a topological sorting algorithm that leverages ancestral relationships in linear structural equation models to establish a compact top-down hierarchical ordering, encoding more causal information than linear orderings produced by existing methods. We demonstrate that this approach generalizes to nonlinear settings with arbitrary noise. We then introduce a nonparametric constraint-based algorithm that prunes spurious edges by searching for local conditioning sets, achieving greater accuracy than current methods. We provide theoretical guarantees for correctness and worst-case polynomial time complexities, with empirical validation on synthetic data.

Hybrid Mamba: An Promising In-Context RL for Long-Term Decision
Recent works have shown the remarkable superiority of transformer models in reinforcement learning (RL), where the decision-making problem is formulated as sequential generation. Transformer-based agents could emerge with self-improvement in online environments by providing task contexts, such as multiple trajectories, called in-context RL. However, due to the quadratic computation complexity of attention in transformers, current in-context RL methods suffer from huge computational costs as the task horizon increases. In contrast, the Mamba model is renowned for its efficient ability to process long-term dependencies, which provides an opportunity for in-context RL to solve tasks that require long-term memory. To this end, we propose a Hybrid Mamba (HM) with the merits of transformers and Mamba in high-quality prediction and long-term memory. Specifically, HM first generates high-value sub-goals from long-term memory through the Mamba model. Then, we use sub-goals to prompt the transformer, establishing high-quality predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that HM achieves state-of-the-art in long and short-term tasks, such as D4RL, Grid World, and Tmaze benchmarks. Regarding efficiency, the online testing of HM in the long-term task is 28$\times$ times faster than the transformer-based baselines.

Hydra: Bidirectional State Space Models Through Generalized Matrix Mixers
A wide array of sequence models are built on a framework modeled after Transformers, comprising alternating sequence mixer and channel mixer layers. This paper studies a unifying matrix mixer view of sequence mixers that can be conceptualized as a linear map on the input sequence. This framework encompasses a broad range of well-known sequence models, including the self-attention of Transformers as well as recent strong alternatives such as structured state space models (SSMs), and allows understanding downstream characteristics such as efficiency and expressivity through properties of their structured matrix class. We identify a key axis of matrix parameterizations termed sequence alignment, which increases the flexibility and performance of matrix mixers, providing insights into the strong performance of Transformers and recent SSMs such as Mamba. Furthermore, the matrix mixer framework offers a systematic approach to developing sequence mixers with desired properties, allowing us to develop several new sub-quadratic sequence models. In particular, we propose a natural bidirectional extension of the Mamba model Hydra, parameterized as a quasiseparable matrix mixer, which demonstrates superior performance over other sequence models including Transformers on non-causal tasks. As a drop-in replacement for attention layers, Hydra outperforms BERT by 0.8 points on the GLUE benchmark and ViT by 2\% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

HYDRA-FL: Hybrid Knowledge Distillation for Robust and Accurate Federated Learning
Data heterogeneity among Federated Learning (FL) users poses a significant challenge, resulting in reduced global model performance. The community has designed various techniques to tackle this issue, among which Knowledge Distillation (KD)-based techniques are common.    While these techniques effectively improve performance under high heterogeneity, they inadvertently cause higher accuracy degradation under model poisoning attacks (known as \emph{attack amplification}). This paper presents a case study to reveal this critical vulnerability in KD-based FL systems. We show why KD causes this issue through empirical evidence and use it as motivation to design a hybrid distillation technique. We introduce a novel algorithm, \emph{Hybrid Knowledge Distillation for Robust and Accurate FL (HYDRA-FL)},    \footnote{We will release the open source code with the final version of this paper.},    which reduces the impact of attacks in attack scenarios by offloading some of the KD loss to a shallow layer via an auxiliary classifier. We model HYDRA-FL as a generic framework and adapt it to two KD-based FL algorithms, FedNTD and MOON. Using these two as case studies, we demonstrate that our technique outperforms baselines in attack settings while maintaining comparable performance in benign settings.

HydraViT: Stacking Heads for a Scalable ViT
The architecture of Vision Transformers (ViTs), particularly the Multi-head Attention (MHA) mechanism, imposes substantial hardware demands. Deploying ViTs on devices with varying constraints, such as mobile phones, requires multiple models of different sizes. However, this approach has limitations, such as training and storing each required model separately. This paper introduces HydraViT, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by stacking attention heads to achieve a scalable ViT. By repeatedly changing the size of the embedded dimensions throughout each layer and their corresponding number of attention heads in MHA during training, HydraViT induces multiple subnetworks. Thereby, HydraViT achieves adaptability across a wide spectrum of hardware environments while maintaining performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of HydraViT in achieving a scalable ViT with up to 10 subnetworks, covering a wide range of resource constraints. HydraViT achieves up to 5 p.p. more accuracy with the same GMACs and up to 7 p.p. more accuracy with the same throughput on ImageNet-1K compared to the baselines, making it an effective solution for scenarios where hardware availability is diverse or varies over time.

Hyperbolic Embeddings of Supervised Models
Models of hyperbolic geometry have been successfully used in ML for two main tasks: embedding *models* in unsupervised learning (*e.g.* hierarchies) and embedding *data*. To our knowledge, there are no approaches that provide embeddings for supervised models; even when hyperbolic geometry provides convenient properties for expressing popular hypothesis classes, such as decision trees (and ensembles).In this paper, we propose a full-fledged solution to the problem in three independent contributions. The first linking the theory of losses for class probability estimation to hyperbolic embeddings in Poincar\'e disk model. The second resolving an issue for a clean, unambiguous embedding of (ensembles of) decision trees in this model. The third showing how to smoothly tweak the Poincar\'e hyperbolic distance to improve its encoding and visualization properties near the border of the disk, a crucial region for our application, while keeping hyperbolicity.This last step has substantial independent interest as it is grounded in a generalization of Leibniz-Newton's fundamental Theorem of calculus.

HyperDDPM: Estimating Epistemic and Aleatoric Uncertainty with a Single Model
Estimating and disentangling epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty that can be reduced with more training data) and aleatoric uncertainty (uncertainty that is inherent to the task at hand) is critically important when applying machine learning to high-stakes applications such as medical imaging and weather forecasting. Conditional diffusion models' breakthrough ability to accurately and efficiently sample from the posterior distribution of a dataset now makes uncertainty estimation conceptually straightforward: One need only train and sample from a large ensemble of diffusion models. Unfortunately, training such an ensemble becomes computationally intractable as the complexity of the model architecture grows. In this work we introduce a new approach to ensembling, HyperDDPM, which allows one to accurately estimate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty {with a single model}. Unlike existing single-model uncertainty methods Monte Carlo dropout and Bayesian neural networks, HyperDDPM offers prediction accuracy on-par with, and in some cases superior to, multi-model ensembles. Furthermore, our proposed approach scales to modern network architectures such as Attention U-Net and yields more accurate uncertainty estimates when compared to existing methods. We validate our method on two distinct real-world tasks: x-ray computed tomography reconstruction and weather temperature forecasting.

Hypergraph-Based Fuzzy Assembled Representation for Open-Set 3D Object Retrieval
The lack of object-level labels presents a significant challenge for 3D object retrieval in the open-set environment. However, part-level shapes of objects often share commonalities across categories but remain underexploited in existing retrieval methods. In this paper, we introduce the Hypergraph-Based Assembly Fuzzy Representation (HFAR) framework, which navigates the intricacies of open-set 3D object retrieval through a bottom-up lens of Part Assembly. To tackle the challenge of assembly isomorphism and unification, we propose the Hypergraph Isomorphism Convolution (HIConv) for smoothing and adopt the Isomorphic Assembly Embedding (IAE) module to generate assembly embeddings with geometric-semantic consistency. To address the challenge of open-set category generalization, our method employs high-order correlations and fuzzy representation to mitigate distribution skew through the Structure Fuzzy Reconstruction (SFR) module, by constructing a leveraged hypergraph based on local certainty and global uncertainty correlations. We construct three open-set retrieval datasets for 3D objects with part-level annotations: OP-SHNP, OP-INTRA, and OP-COSEG. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on these three benchmarks show our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

HyperLogic: Enhancing Diversity and Accuracy in Rule Learning with HyperNets
Exploring the integration of if-then logic rules within neural network architectures  presents an intriguing area. This integration seamlessly transforms the rule learning task into neural network training using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. From a well-trained sparse and shallow neural network, one can interpret each layer and neuron through the language of logic rules, and a global explanatory rule set can be directly extracted. However, ensuring interpretability may impose constraints on the flexibility, depth, and width of neural networks. In this paper, we propose HyperLogic: a novel framework leveraging hypernetworks to generate weights of the main network. HyperLogic can unveil multiple diverse rule sets, each capable of capturing heterogeneous patterns in data. This provides a simple yet effective method to increase model flexibility and preserve interpretability. We theoretically analyzed the benefits of the HyperLogic by examining the approximation error and generalization capabilities under two types of regularization terms: sparsity and diversity regularizations. Experiments on real data demonstrate that our method can learn more diverse, accurate, and concise rules.

Hyper-opinion Evidential Deep Learning for Out-of-Distribution Detection
Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), grounded in Evidence Theory and Subjective Logic (SL), provides a robust framework to estimate uncertainty for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection alongside traditional classification probabilities.However, the EDL framework is constrained by its focus on evidence that supports only single categories, neglecting the other collective evidences that could corroborate multiple in-distribution categories. This limitation leads to a diminished estimation of uncertainty and a subsequent decline in OOD detection performance.Additionally, EDL encounters the vanishing gradient problem within its fully-connected layers, further degrading classification accuracy.To address these issues, we introduce hyper-domain and propose Hyper-opinion Evidential Deep Learning (HEDL). HEDL extends the evidence modeling paradigm by explicitly integrating sharp evidence, which supports a singular category, with vague evidence that accommodates multiple potential categories.Additionally, we propose a novel opinion projection mechanism that translates hyper-opinion into multinomial-opinion, which is then optimized within the EDL framework to ensure precise classification and refined uncertainty estimation.HEDL integrates evidences across various categories to yield a holistic evidentiary foundation for achieving superior OOD detection. Furthermore, our proposed opinion projection method effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient issue, ensuring classification accuracy without additional model complexity. Extensive experiments over many datasets demonstrate our proposed method outperforms existing OOD detection methods.

HyperPrism: An Adaptive Non-linear Aggregation Framework for Distributed Machine Learning over Non-IID Data and Time-varying Communication Links
While Distributed Machine Learning (DML) has been widely used to achieve decent performance, it is still challenging to take full advantage of data and devices distributed at multiple vantage points to adapt and learn, especially it is non-trivial to address dynamic and divergence challenges based on the linear aggregation framework as follows: (1) heterogeneous learning data at different devices (i.e., non-IID data) resulting in model divergence and (2) in the case of time-varying communication links, the limited ability for devices to reconcile model divergence. In this paper, we contribute a non-linear class aggregation framework HyperPrism that leverages distributed mirror descent with averaging done in the mirror descent dual space and adapts the degree of Weighted Power Mean (WPM) used in each round. Moreover, HyperPrism could adaptively choose different mapping for different layers of the local model with a dedicated hypernetwork per device, achieving automatic optimization of DML in high divergence settings. We perform rigorous analysis and experimental evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive, mirror-mapping DML. In particular, we extend the generalizability of existing related works and position them as special cases within HyperPrism. Our experimental results show that HyperPrism can improve the convergence speed up to 98.63% and scale well to more devices compared with the state-of-the-art, all with little additional computation overhead compared to traditional linear aggregation.

Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis
Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.

I2EBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Instruction-based Image Editing
Significant progress has been made in the field of Instruction-based Image Editing (IIE). However, evaluating these models poses a significant challenge. A crucial requirement in this field is the establishment of a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for accurately assessing editing results and providing valuable insights for its further development. In response to this need, we propose I2EBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to automatically evaluate the quality of edited images produced by IIE models from multiple dimensions. I2EBench consists of 2000+ images for editing, along with corresponding original and diverse instructions. It offers three distinctive characteristics: 1) Comprehensive Evaluation Dimensions: I2EBench comprises 16 evaluation dimensions that cover both high-level and low-level aspects, providing a comprehensive assessment of each IIE model. 2) Human Perception Alignment: To ensure the alignment of our benchmark with human perception, we conducted an extensive user study for each evaluation dimension. 3) Valuable Research Insights: By analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of existing IIE models across the 16 dimensions, we offer valuable research insights to guide future development in the field. We will open-source I2EBench, including all instructions, input images, human annotations, edited images from all evaluated methods, and a simple script for evaluating the results from new IIE models.

Identifiability Guarantees for Causal Disentanglement from Purely Observational Data
Causal disentanglement aims to learn about latent causal factors behind data, holding the promise to augment existing representation learning methods in terms of interpretability and extrapolation. Recent advances establish identifiability results assuming that interventions on (single) latent factors are available; however, it remains debatable whether such assumptions are reasonable due to the inherent nature of intervening on latent variables. Accordingly, we reconsider the fundamentals and ask what can be learned using just observational data. We provide a precise characterization of latent factors that can be identified in nonlinear causal models with additive Gaussian noise and linear mixing, without any interventions or graphical restrictions. In particular, we show that the causal variables can be identified up to a _layer_-wise transformation and that further disentanglement is not possible. We transform these theoretical results into a practical algorithm consisting of solving a quadratic program over the score estimation of the observed data. We provide simulation results to support our theoretical guarantees and demonstrate that our algorithm can derive meaningful causal representations from purely observational data.

Identifiable Object-Centric Representation Learning via Probabilistic Slot Attention
Learning modular object-centric representations is said to be crucial for systematic generalization. Existing methods show promising object-binding capabilities empirically, but theoretical identifiability guarantees remain relatively underdeveloped. Understanding when object-centric representations can theoretically be identified is important for scaling slot-based methods to high-dimensional images with correctness guarantees. To that end, we propose a probabilistic slot-attention algorithm that imposes an *aggregate* mixture prior over object-centric slot representations, thereby providing slot identifiability guarantees without supervision, up to an equivalence relation. We provide empirical verification of our theoretical identifiability result using both simple 2-dimensional data and high-resolution imaging datasets.

Identifying and Solving Conditional Image Leakage in Image-to-Video Generation
Diffusion models have obtained substantial progress in image-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such models are not fully understood. In this paper, we report a significant but previously overlooked issue in I2V diffusion models (I2V-DMs), namely, \emph{conditional image leakage}. I2V-DMs tend to over-rely on the conditional image at large time steps, neglecting the crucial task of predicting the clean video from noisy inputs, which results in videos lacking dynamic and vivid motion. We further address this challenge from both inference and training aspects by presenting plug-and-play strategies accordingly. First, we introduce a training-free inference strategy that starts the generation process from an earlier time step to avoid the unreliable late-time steps of I2V-DMs, as well as an initial noise distribution with optimal analytic expressions (Analytic-Init) by minimizing the KL divergence between it and the actual marginal distribution to effectively bridge the training-inference gap. Second, to mitigate conditional image leakage during training, we design a time-dependent noise distribution for the conditional image, which favors high noise levels at large time steps to sufficiently interfere with the conditional image. We validate these strategies on various I2V-DMs using our collected open-domain image benchmark and the UCF101 dataset. Extensive results demonstrate that our methods outperform baselines by producing videos with more dynamic and natural motion without compromising image alignment and temporal consistency.

Identifying Causal Effects Under Functional Dependencies
We study the identification of causal effects, motivated by two improvements to identifiability which can be attained if one knows that some variables in a causal graph are functionally determined by their parents (without needing to know the specific functions). First, an unidentifiable causal effect may become identifiable when certain variables are functional. Second, certain functional variables can be excluded from being observed without affecting the identifiability of a causal effect, which may significantly reduce the number of needed variables in observational data. Our results are largely based on an elimination procedure which removes functional variables from a causal graph while preserving key properties in the resulting causal graph, including the identifiability of causal effects.

Identifying Equivalent Training Dynamics
Study of the nonlinear evolution deep neural network (DNN) parameters undergo during training has uncovered regimes of distinct dynamical behavior. While a detailed understanding of these phenomena has the potential to advance improvements in training efficiency and robustness, the lack of methods for identifying when DNN models have equivalent dynamics limits the insight that can be gained from prior work. Topological conjugacy, a notion from dynamical systems theory, provides a precise definition of dynamical equivalence, offering a possible route to address this need. However, topological conjugacies have historically been challenging to compute. By leveraging advances in Koopman operator theory, we develop a framework for identifying conjugate and non-conjugate training dynamics. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that it can correctly identify a known equivalence between online mirror descent and online gradient descent. We then utilize it to: identify non-conjugate training dynamics between shallow and wide fully connected neural networks; characterize the early phase of training dynamics in convolutional neural networks; uncover non-conjugate training dynamics in Transformers that do and do not undergo grokking. Our results, across a range of DNN architectures, illustrate the flexibility of our framework and highlight its potential for shedding new light on training dynamics.

Identifying Functionally Important Features with End-to-End Sparse Dictionary Learning
Identifying the features learned by neural networks is a core challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs), which learn a sparse, overcomplete dictionary that reconstructs a network's internal activations, have been used to identify these features. However, SAEs may learn more about the structure of the datatset than the computational structure of the network. There is therefore only indirect reason to believe that the directions found in these dictionaries are functionally important to the network. We propose end-to-end (e2e) sparse dictionary learning, a method for training SAEs that ensures the features learned are functionally important by minimizing the KL divergence between the output distributions of the original model and the model with SAE activations inserted. Compared to standard SAEs, e2e SAEs offer a Pareto improvement: They explain more network performance, require fewer total features, and require fewer simultaneously active features per datapoint, all with no cost to interpretability. We explore geometric and qualitative differences between e2e SAE features and standard SAE features. E2e dictionary learning brings us closer to methods that can explain network behavior concisely and accurately.

Identifying General Mechanism Shifts in Linear Causal Representations
We consider the linear causal representation learning setting where we observe a linear mixing of $d$ unknown latent factors, which follow a linear structural causal model. Recent work has shown that it is possible to recover the latent factors as well as the underlying structural causal model over them, up to permutation and scaling, provided that we have at least $d$ environments, each of which corresponds to perfect interventions on a single latent node (factor). After this powerful result, a key open problem faced by the community has been to relax these conditions: allow for coarser than perfect single-node interventions, and allow for fewer than $d$ of them, since the number of latent factors $d$ could be very large. In this work, we consider precisely such a setting, where we allow a smaller than $d$ number of environments, and also allow for very coarse interventions that can very coarsely *change the entire causal graph over the latent factors*. On the flip side, we relax what we wish to extract to simply the *list of nodes that have shifted between one or more environments*. We provide a surprising identifiability result that it is indeed possible, under some very mild standard assumptions, to identify the set of shifted nodes. Our identifiability proof moreover is a constructive one: we explicitly provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a node to be a shifted node, and show that we can check these conditions given observed data. Our algorithm lends itself very naturally to the sample setting where instead of just interventional distributions, we are provided datasets of samples from each of these distributions. We corroborate our results on both synthetic experiments as well as an interesting psychometric dataset.

Identify Then Recommend: Towards Unsupervised Group Recommendation
Group Recommendation (GR), which aims to recommend items to groups of users, has become a promising and practical direction for recommendation systems. This paper points out two issues of the state-of-the-art GR models. (1) The pre-defined and fixed number of user groups is inadequate for real-time industrial recommendation systems, where the group distribution can shift dynamically. (2) The training schema of existing GR methods is supervised, necessitating expensive user-group and group-item labels, leading to significant annotation costs. To this end, we present a novel unsupervised group recommendation framework named $\underline{\text{I}}$dentify $\underline{\text{T}}$hen $\underline{\text{R}}$ecommend ($\underline{\text{ITR}}$), where it first identifies the user groups in an unsupervised manner even without the pre-defined number of groups, and then two pre-text tasks are designed to conduct self-supervised group recommendation. Concretely, at the group identification stage, we first estimate the adaptive density of each user point, where areas with higher densities are more likely to be recognized as group centers. Then, a heuristic merge-and-split strategy is designed to discover the user groups and decision boundaries. Subsequently, at the self-supervised learning stage, the pull-and-repulsion pre-text task is proposed to optimize the user-group distribution. Besides, the pseudo group recommendation pre-text task is designed to assist the recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of ITR on both user recommendation (e.g., 22.22\% NDCG@5 $\uparrow$) and group recommendation (e.g., 22.95\% NDCG@5 $\uparrow$). Furthermore, we deploy ITR on the industrial recommender and achieve promising results.

Identity Decoupling for Multi-Subject Personalization of Text-to-Image Models
Text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating personalized subjects based on a few reference images. However, current methods often fail when generating multiple subjects simultaneously, resulting in mixedidentities with combined attributes from different subjects. In this work, we present MuDI, a novel framework that enables multi-subject personalization by effectively decoupling identities from multiple subjects. Our main idea is to utilize segmented subjects generated by a foundation model for segmentation (Segment Anything) for both training and inference, as a form of data augmentation for training and initialization for the generation process. Moreover, we further introduce a new metric to better evaluate the performance of our method on multi-subject personalization. Experimental results show that our MuDI can produce high-quality personalized images without identity mixing, even for highly similar subjects as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, in human evaluation, MuDI obtains twice the success rate for personalizing multiple subjects without identity mixing over existing baselines and is preferred over 70% against the strongest baseline.

Idiographic Personality Gaussian Process for Psychological Assessment
We develop a novel measurement framework based on Gaussian process coregionalization model to address a long-lasting debate in psychometrics: whether psychological features like personality share a common structure across the population or vary uniquely for individuals. We propose idiographic personality Gaussian process (IPGP), an intermediate model that accommodates both shared trait structure across individuals and "idiographic" deviations. IPGP leverages the Gaussian process coregionalization model to conceptualize responses of grouped survey batteries but adjusted to non-Gaussian ordinal data, and exploits stochastic variational inference for latent factor estimation. Using both synthetic data and a novel survey, we show that IPGP improves both prediction of actual responses and estimation of intrapersonal response patterns compared to existing benchmarks. In the survey study, IPGP also identifies unique clusters of personality taxonomies, displaying great potential in advancing individualized approaches to psychological diagnosis.

ID-to-3D: Expressive ID-guided 3D Heads via Score Distillation Sampling
We propose ID-to-3D, a method to generate identity- and text-guided 3D human heads with disentangled expressions, starting from even a single casually captured ‘in-the-wild’ image of a subject. The foundation of our approach is anchored in compositionality, alongside the use of task-specific 2D diffusion models as priors for optimization. First, we extend a foundational model with a lightweight expression-aware and ID-aware architecture, and create 2D priors for geometric and texture generation, via fine-tuning only 0.2% of its available training parameters. Then, we jointly leverage a neural parametric representation for the expression of each subject and a multi-stage generation of highly detailed geometry and albedo texture. This combination of strong face identity embeddings and our neural representation enables accurate reconstruction of not only facial features but also accessories and hair, and can be meshed to provide render-ready assets for gaming and telepresence. Our results achieve an unprecedented level of id-consistent and high-quality texture and geometry generation, generalizing to a ‘world’ of unseen 3D identities, without relying on large 3D captured datasets of human assets.

If You Want to Be Robust, Be Wary of Initialization
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs, on a model’s robustness.We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between initial weights, number of training epochs and the model’s vulnerability, offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations, with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization approaches.

IllumiNeRF: 3D Relighting without Inverse Rendering
Existing methods for relightable view synthesis --- using a set of images of an object under unknown lighting to recover a 3D representation that can be rendered from novel viewpoints under a target illumination --- are based on inverse rendering, and attempt to disentangle the object geometry, materials, and lighting that explain the input images. Furthermore, this typically involves optimization through differentiable Monte Carlo rendering, which is brittle and computationally-expensive. In this work, we propose a simpler approach: we first relight each input image using an image diffusion model conditioned on lighting and then reconstruct a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) with these relit images, from which we render novel views under the target lighting. We demonstrate that this strategy is surprisingly competitive and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple relighting benchmarks.

Image Copy Detection for Diffusion Models
Images produced by diffusion models are increasingly popular in digital artwork and visual marketing. However, such generated images might replicate content from existing ones and pose the challenge of content originality. Existing Image Copy Detection (ICD) models, though accurate in detecting hand-crafted replicas, overlook the challenge from diffusion models. This motivates us to introduce ICDiff, the first ICD specialized for diffusion models. To this end, we construct a Diffusion-Replication (D-Rep) dataset and correspondingly propose a novel deep embedding method. D-Rep uses a state-of-the-art diffusion model (Stable Diffusion V1.5) to generate 40, 000 image-replica pairs, which are manually annotated into 6 replication levels ranging from 0 (no replication) to 5 (total replication). Our method, PDF-Embedding, transforms the replication level of each image-replica pair into a probability density function (PDF) as the supervision signal. The intuition is that the probability of neighboring replication levels should be continuous and smooth. Experimental results show that PDF-Embedding surpasses a vast spectrum of deep embedding models (including previous ICD models) on the D-Rep test set. Moreover, by utilizing PDF-Embedding, we find that the replication ratios of well-known diffusion models against an open-source gallery range from 10% to 20%.

ImageNet++: A Large-Scale Benchmark of Data Curation Strategies
Data curation is the problem of how to collect and organize samples into a dataset that supports efficient learning. Despite the centrality of the task, little work has been devoted towards a large-scale, systematic comparison of various curation methods. In this work, we take steps towards a formal evaluation of data curation strategies and introduce SELECT, the first large-scale benchmark of curation strategies for image classification.In order to generate baseline methods for the SELECT benchmark, we create a new dataset, ImageNet++, which constitutes the largest superset of ImageNet-1K to date. Our dataset extends ImageNet with 5 new training-data shifts, each approximately the size of  ImageNet-1K, and each assembled using a distinct curation strategy. We evaluate our data curation baselines in two ways: (i) using each training-data shift to train identical image classification models from scratch (ii) using it to inspect a fixed pretrained self-supervised representation.Our findings show interesting trends, particularly pertaining to recent methods for data curation such as synthetic data generation and lookup based on CLIP embeddings. We show that although these strategies are highly competitive for certain tasks, the curation strategy used to assemble the original ImageNet-1K dataset remains the gold standard. We anticipate that our benchmark can illuminate the path for new methods to further reduce the gap. We release our checkpoints, code, documentation, and a link to our dataset at https://github.com/jimmyxu123/SELECT.

Image Reconstruction Via Autoencoding Sequential Deep Image Prior
Recently, Deep Image Prior (DIP) has emerged as an effective unsupervised one-shot learner, delivering competitive results across various image recovery problems. This method only requires the noisy measurements and a forward operator, relying solely on deep networks initialized with random noise to learn and restore the structure of the data. However, DIP is notorious for its vulnerability to overfitting due to the overparameterization of the network. Building upon insights into the impact of the DIP input and drawing inspiration from the gradual denoising process in cutting-edge diffusion models, we introduce the Autoencoding Sequential DIP (aSeqDIP) for image reconstruction by progressively denoising and reconstructing the image through a sequential optimization of multiple network architectures. This is achieved using an input-adaptive DIP objective, combined with an autoencoding regularization term. Our approach differs from the vanilla DIP by not relying on a single-step denoising process. Compared to diffusion models, our method does not require pre-training and outperforms the vanilla DIP in alleviating overfitting while maintaining the same number of parameter updates. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method in various imaging reconstruction tasks, such as MRI and CT reconstruction, as well as in image restoration tasks like image denoising and inpainting.

Images that Sound: Composing Images and Sounds on a Single Canvas
Spectrograms are 2D representations of sound that look very different from the images found in our visual world. And natural images, when played as spectrograms, make unnatural sounds. In this paper, we show that it is possible to synthesize spectrograms that simultaneously look like natural images and sound like natural audio. We call these spectrograms *images that sound*. Our approach is simple and zero-shot, and it leverages pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-spectrogram diffusion models that operate in a shared latent space. During the reverse process, we denoise noisy latents with both the audio and image diffusion models in parallel, resulting in a sample that is likely under both models. Through quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies, we find that our method successfully generates spectrograms that align with a desired audio prompt while also taking the visual appearance of a desired image prompt.

Image Understanding Makes for A Good Tokenizer for Image Generation
Modern image generation (IG) models have been shown to capture rich semantics valuable for image understanding (IU) tasks. However, the potential of IU models to improve IG performance remains uncharted. We address this issue using a token-based IG framework, which relies on effective tokenizers to project images into token sequences. Currently, **pixel reconstruction** (e.g., VQGAN) dominates the training objective for image tokenizers. In contrast, our approach adopts the **feature reconstruction** objective, where tokenizers are trained by distilling knowledge from pretrained IU encoders. Comprehensive comparisons indicate that tokenizers with strong IU capabilities achieve superior IG performance across a variety of metrics, datasets, tasks, and proposal networks. Notably, VQ-KD ViT achieves 7.82 FID and 130.41 IS on ImageNet-1K (IN-1K). Visualization suggests that the superiority of VQ-KD can be partly attributed to the rich semantics within the VQ-KD codebook. We further introduce a straightforward pipeline to directly transform IU encoders into tokenizers, demonstrating exceptional effectiveness for IG tasks. These discoveries may energize further exploration into image tokenizer research and inspire the community to reassess the relationship between IU and IG. The code is available in the supplemental materials.

IMAGPose: A Unified Conditional Framework for Pose-Guided Person Generation
Diffusion models represent a promising avenue for image generation, having demonstrated competitive performance in pose-guided person image generation. However, existing methods are limited to generating target images from a source image and a target pose, overlooking two critical user scenarios: generating multiple target images with different poses simultaneously and generating target images from multi-view source images.To overcome these limitations, we propose IMAGPose, a unified conditional framework for pose-guided image generation, which incorporates three pivotal modules: a feature-level conditioning (FLC) module, an image-level conditioning (ILC) module, and a cross-view attention (CVA) module. Firstly, the FLC module combines the low-level texture feature from the VAE encoder with the high-level semantic feature from the image encoder, addressing the issue of missing detail information due to the absence of a dedicated person image feature extractor. Then, the ILC module achieves an alignment of images and poses to adapt to flexible and diverse user scenarios by injecting a variable number of source image conditions and introducing a masking strategy.Finally, the CVA module introduces decomposing global and local cross-attention, ensuring local fidelity and global consistency of the person image when multiple source image prompts. The three modules of IMAGPose work together to unify the task of person image generation under various user scenarios.Extensive experiment results demonstrate the consistency and photorealism of our proposed IMAGPose under challenging user scenarios. Our code and models will be publicly available.

IMDL-BenCo: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Codebase for Image Manipulation Detection & Localization
A comprehensive benchmark is yet to be established in the Image Manipulation Detection \& Localization (IMDL) field. The absence of such a benchmark leads to insufficient and misleading model evaluations, severely undermining the development of this field. However, the scarcity of open-sourced baseline models and inconsistent training and evaluation protocols make conducting rigorous experiments and faithful comparisons among IMDL models challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce IMDL-BenCo, the first comprehensive IMDL benchmark and modular codebase. IMDL-BenCo: i) decomposes the IMDL framework into standardized, reusable components and revises the model construction pipeline, improving coding efficiency and customization flexibility; ii) fully implements or incorporates training code for state-of-the-art models to establish a comprehensive IMDL benchmark; and iii) conducts deep analysis based on the established benchmark and codebase, offering new insights into IMDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation standards.Specifically, IMDL-BenCo includes common processing algorithms, 8 state-of-the-art IMDL models (1 of which are reproduced from scratch), 2 sets of standard training and evaluation protocols, 15 GPU-accelerated evaluation metrics, and 3 kinds of robustness evaluation. This benchmark and codebase represent a significant leap forward in calibrating the current progress in the IMDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.Code is available at: https://github.com/scu-zjz/IMDLBenCo

Immiscible Diffusion: Accelerating Diffusion Training with Noise Assignment
In this paper, we point out suboptimal noise-data mapping leads to slow training of diffusion models. During diffusion training, it diffuses each image across the entire noise space, resulting in a mixture of all images at every point in the noise layer. We emphasize that this random mixture of noise-data mapping complicates the optimization of the denoising function in diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the immiscible phenomenon in physics, we propose immiscible diffusion, a simple yet effective method to improve the random mixture of noise-data mapping. In physics, miscibility can vary according to various intermolecular forces. Inspired by this concept, we propose an assignment-then-diffusion training strategy. Specifically, prior to diffusing the image data into noise, we assign diffusion target noise for the image data by minimizing the total image-noise pair distance in a mini-batch. The assignment functions analogously to external forces to separate the diffuse-able areas of images, thus mitigating the inherent difficulties in diffusion training. Our approach is remarkably simple, requiring only one line of code to restrict the diffuse-able area for each image while preserving the Gaussian distribution of noise. This ensures that each image is projected only to nearby noise. To address the high complexity of the assignment algorithm, we introduce a quantized-assignment strategy, which significantly reduces the computational overhead to a negligible level. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve up to 3x faster training for consistency models and DDIM on the CIFAR dataset, and up to 1.3x faster on CelebA datasets for consistency models. Besides, we conduct thorough analysis about the immiscible diffusion, which sheds lights on how it improves diffusion training speed while improving the fidelity.

Implicit Bias of Mirror Flow on Separable Data
We examine the continuous-time counterpart of mirror descent, namely mirror flow, on classification problems which are linearly separable. Such problems are minimised ‘at infinity’ and have many possible solutions; we study which solution is preferred by the algorithm depending on the mirror potential. For exponential tailed losses and under mild assumptions on the potential, we show that the iterates converge in direction towards a $\phi_\infty$-maximum margin classifier. The function $\phi_\infty$ is the horizon function of the mirror potential and characterises its shape ‘at infinity’. When the potential is separable, a simple formula allows to compute this function. We analyse several examples of potentials and provide numerical experiments highlighting our results.

Implicit Curriculum in Procgen Made Explicit
Procedurally generated environments such as Procgen Benchmark provides a testbed for evaluating the agent's ability to robustly learn a relevant skill, by situating the agent in ever-changing levels. The diverse levels associated with varying contexts are naturally connected to curriculum learning. Existing works mainly focus on arranging the levels to explicitly form a curriculum. In this work, we take a close look at the learning process itself under the multi-level training in Procgen. Interestingly, the learning process exhibits a gradual shift from easy contexts to hard contexts, suggesting an implicit curriculum in multi-level training. Our analysis is made possible through C-Procgen, a benchmark we build upon Procgen that enables explicit control of the contexts. We believe our findings will foster a deeper understanding of learning in diverse contexts, and our benchmark will benefit future research in curriculum reinforcement learning.

Implicit Regularization of Decentralized Gradient Descent for Sparse Regression
We consider learning a sparse model from linear measurements taken by a network of agents. Different from existing decentralized methods designed based on the LASSO regression with explicit  $\ell_1$ norm regularization, we exploit the implicit regularization of gradient descent and analyze its decentralized counterpart applied to an over-parameterized nonconvex least squares formulation without penalization. Our first result shows that despite nonconvexity, the classical decentralized gradient descent algorithm (DGD) with small initialization and early stopping can compute the statistically optimal solution. Sufficient conditions on the initialization scale,  choice of step size, network connectivity, and stopping time are further provided to achieve convergence. Our result recovers the convergence rate of gradient descent in the centralized setting, showing its tightness. Based on the analysis of DGD, we further propose a communication-efficient version, termed T-DGD, by truncating the iterates before transmission. In the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, we show that T-DGD achieves comparable statistical accuracy to DGD, while the communication cost is logarithmic in the number of parameters. Numerical results are provided validating the effectiveness of DGD and T-DGD for sparse learning through implicit regularization.

Implicit regularization of multi-task learning and finetuning: multiple regimes of feature reuse
In this work, we investigate the inductive biases that arise from learning multiple tasks, either simultaneously (multi-task learning, MTL) or sequentially (pretraining and subsequent finetuning, PT+FT). We describe novel implicit regularization penalties associated with MTL and PT+FT in diagonal linear networks and single-hidden-layer ReLU networks. These penalties indicate that MTL and PT+FT induce the network to reuse features in different ways. 1) Both MTL and PT+FT exhibit biases towards feature reuse between tasks, and towards sparsity in the set of learned features. We show a "conservation law" that implies a direct tradeoff between these two biases. Our results also imply that during finetuning, networks operate in a hybrid of the kernel (or "lazy") regime and the feature-learning ("rich") regime identified in prior work. 2) PT+FT exhibits a novel "nested feature selection" behavior not described by either the lazy or rich regimes, which biases it to *extract a sparse subset* of the features learned during pretraining. This regime is much narrower for MTL. 3) PT+FT (but not MTL) in ReLU networks benefits from features that are correlated between the auxiliary and main task. We confirm our insights empirically with teacher-student models. Finally, we validate our theory in deep neural networks trained on image classification tasks, finding that they may exhibit a nested feature selection regime. We also introduce a practical technique -- weight rescaling following pretraining -- and provide evidence that this method can improve finetuning performance by inducing the network to operate in the nested feature selection regime.

Implicit Regularization Paths of Weighted Neural Representations
Pretrained features extracted from neural networks have proven to be powerful representations for various downstream tasks. However, the high dimensionality of these features, such as neural tangent kernel representations, often poses computational and memory challenges in model fitting. In this paper, we investigate the implicit regularization effects of weighted pretrained features, including subsampling as a special case to alleviate the computational and memory burden. By characterizing the implicit regularization due to weighted regression, we derive a path of equivalence connecting different weighting matrices and ridge regularization with matching effective degrees of freedom. For the special case of subsampling without replacement, our results apply to both random features and kernel features, resolving recent conjectures posed by Patil and Du (2023). Furthermore, we present a risk decomposition for an ensemble of weighted estimators and demonstrate that the risks are equivalent along the path for the full ensembles. Finally, for tuning in practice, we also develop an efficient cross-validation method and apply it to subsampled pretrained representations across several models (e.g., ResNet-50) and datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100), which confirms our theoretical findings and highlights the practical implications of the induced implicit regularization.

Imprecise Label Learning: A Unified Framework for Learning with Various Imprecise Label Configurations
Learning with reduced labeling standards, such as noisy label, partial label, and supplementary unlabeled data, which we generically refer to as imprecise label, is a commonplace challenge in machine learning tasks. Previous methods tend to propose specific designs for every emerging imprecise label configuration, which is usually unsustainable when multiple configurations of imprecision coexist. In this paper, we introduce imprecise label learning (ILL), a framework for the unification of learning with various imprecise label configurations. ILL leverages expectation-maximization (EM) for modeling the imprecise label information, treating the precise labels as latent variables. Instead of approximating the correct labels for training, it considers the entire distribution of all possible labeling entailed by the imprecise information. We demonstrate that ILL can seamlessly adapt to partial label learning, semi-supervised learning, noisy label learning, and, more importantly, a mixture of these settings, with closed-form learning objectives derived from the unified EM modeling. Notably, ILL surpasses the existing specified techniques for handling imprecise labels, marking the first practical and unified framework with robust and effective performance across various challenging settings. We hope our work will inspire further research on this topic, unleashing the full potential of ILL in wider scenarios where precise labels are expensive and complicated to obtain.

Improved Algorithms for Contextual Dynamic Pricing
In contextual dynamic pricing,  a seller sequentially prices goods based on contextual information. Buyers will purchase products only if the prices are below their valuations.The goal of the seller is to design a pricing strategy that collects as much revenue as possible. We focus on two different valuation models. The first assumes that valuations linearly depend on the context and are further distorted by noise. Under minor regularity assumptions, our algorithm achieves an optimal regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$, improving the existing results. The second model removes the linearity assumption, requiring only that the expected buyer valuation is $\beta$-H\"older in the context. For this model, our algorithm obtains a regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{d+2\beta/d+3\beta})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the context space.

Improved Distribution Matching Distillation for Fast Image Synthesis
Recent approaches have shown promises distilling expensive diffusion models into efficient one-step generators.Amongst them, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) produces one-step generators that match their teacher in distribution, i.e., the distillation process does not enforce a one-to-one correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers.However, to ensure stable training in practice, DMD requires an additional regression loss computed using a large set of noise--image pairs, generated by the teacher with many steps of a deterministic sampler.This is not only computationally expensive for large-scale text-to-image synthesis, but it also limits the student's quality, tying it too closely to the teacher's original sampling paths.We introduce DMD2, a set of techniques that lift this limitation and improve DMD training.First, we eliminate the regression loss and the need for expensive dataset construction.We show that the resulting instability is due to the "fake" critic not estimating the distribution of generated samples with sufficient accuracy and propose a two time-scale update rule as a remedy.Second, we integrate a GAN loss into the distillation procedure, discriminating between generated samples and real images.This lets us train the student model on real data, thus mitigating the imperfect "real" score estimation from the teacher model, and thereby enhancing quality.Third, we introduce a new training procedure that enables multi-step sampling in the student, andaddresses the training--inference input mismatch of previous work, by simulating inference-time generator samples during training. Taken together, our improvements set new benchmarks in one-step image generation, with FID scores of 1.28 on ImageNet-64×64 and 8.35 on zero-shot COCO 2014, surpassing the original teacher despite a 500X reduction in inference cost.Further, we show our approach can generate megapixel images by distilling SDXL, demonstrating exceptional visual quality among few-step methods, and surpassing the teacher. We will release our code and pretrained models.

Improved Guarantees for Fully Dynamic $k$-Center Clustering with Outliers in General Metric Spaces
The metric $k$-center clustering problem with $z$ outliers, also known as $(k,z)$-center clustering, involves clustering a given point set $P$ in a metric space $(M,d)$ using at most $k$ balls, minimizing the maximum ball radius while excluding up to $z$ points from the clustering. This problem holds fundamental significance in various domains such as machine learning, data mining, and database systems.This paper addresses the fully dynamic version of the problem, where the point set undergoes continuous updates (insertions and deletions) over time. The objective is to maintain an approximate $(k,z)$-center clustering with efficient update times. We propose a novel fully dynamic algorithm that maintains a $(4+\epsilon)$-approximate solution to the $(k,z)$-center clustering problem that covers all but at most $(1+\epsilon)z$ points at any time in the sequence with probability $1-k/e^{\Omega(\log k)}$. The algorithm achieves an expected amortized update time of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2} k^6\log(k) \log(\Delta))$, and is applicable to general metric spaces. Our dynamic algorithm presents a significant improvement over the recent dynamic $(14+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm by Chan, Lattanzi, Sozio, and Wang for this problem.

Improved off-policy training of diffusion samplers
We study the problem of training diffusion models to sample from a distribution with a given unnormalized density or energy function. We benchmark several diffusion-structured inference methods, including simulation-based variational approaches and off-policy methods (continuous generative flow networks). Our results shed light on the relative advantages of existing algorithms while bringing into question some claims from past work. We also propose a novel exploration strategy for off-policy methods, based on local search in the target space with the use of a replay buffer, and show that it improves the quality of samples on a variety of target distributions. Our code for the sampling methods and benchmarks studied is made public at [this link](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/neurips2024-submission3243) as a base for future work on diffusion models for amortized inference.

Improved Particle Approximation Error for Mean Field Neural Networks
Mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD) minimizes an entropy-regularized nonlinear convex functional defined over the space of probability distributions. MFLD has gained attention due to its connection with noisy gradient descent for mean-field two-layer neural networks. Unlike standard Langevin dynamics, the nonlinearity of the objective functional induces particle interactions, necessitating multiple particles to approximate the dynamics in a finite-particle setting. Recent works (Chen et al., 2022; Suzuki et al., 2023b) have demonstrated the uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for MFLD, showing that the gap between the particle system and its mean-field limit uniformly shrinks over time as the number of particles increases. In this work, we improve the dependence on logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) constants in their particle approximation errors, which can exponentially deteriorate with the regularization coefficient. Specifically, we establish an LSI-constant-free particle approximation error concerning the objective gap by leveraging the problem structure in risk minimization. As the application, we demonstrate improved convergence of MFLD, sampling guarantee for the mean-field stationary distribution, and uniform-in-time Wasserstein propagation of chaos in terms of particle complexity.

Improved Sample Complexity Bounds for Diffusion Model Training
Diffusion models have become the most popular approach to deep generative modeling of images, largely due to their empirical performance and reliability. From a theoretical standpoint, a number of recent works [CCL+23, CCSW22, BBDD24] have studied the iteration complexity of sampling, assuming access to an accurate diffusion model. In this work, we focus on understanding the *sample complexity* of training such a model; how many samples are needed to learn an accurate diffusion model using a sufficiently expressive neural network? Prior work [BMR20] showed bounds polynomial in the dimension, desired Total Variation error, and Wasserstein error. We show an *exponential improvement* in the dependence on Wasserstein error and depth, along with improved dependencies on other relevant parameters.

Improved Sample Complexity for Multiclass PAC Learning
We aim to understand the optimal PAC sample complexity in multiclass learning. While finiteness of the Daniely-Shalev-Shwartz (DS) dimension has been shown to characterize the PAC learnability of a concept class [Brukhim, Carmon, Dinur, Moran, and Yehudayoff, 2022], there exist polylog factor gaps in the leading term of the sample complexity. In this paper, we reduce the gap in terms of the dependence on the error parameter to a single log factor and also propose two possible routes towards completely resolving the optimal sample complexity, each based on a key open question we formulate: one concerning list learning with bounded list size, the other concerning a new type of shifting for multiclass concept classes. We prove that a positive answer to either of the two questions would completely resolve the optimal sample complexity up to log factors of the DS dimension.

Improving Adaptivity via Over-Parameterization in Sequence Models
It is well known that eigenfunctions of a kernel play a crucial role in kernel regression.Through several examples, we demonstrate that even with the same set of eigenfunctions, the order of these functions significantly impacts regression outcomes.Leveraging the Le Cam equivalence, a statistical equivalence between the sequence model and kernel regression, we introduce an over-parameterized gradient descent in the realm of sequence model to capture the effects of various orders of a fixed set of eigen-functions.This method is designed to explore the impact of varying eigenfunction orders.Our theoretical results show that the over-parameterization gradient flow can adapt to the underlying structure of the signal and significantly outperform the vanilla gradient flow method.Moreover, we also demonstrate that deeper over-parameterization can further enhance the generalization capability of the model.These results not only provide a new perspective on the benefits of over-parameterization and but also offer insights into the adaptivity and generalization potential of neural networks beyond the kernel regime.

Improving Adversarial Robust Fairness via Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation
Adversarial Training (AT) has been widely proved to be an effective method to improve the adversarial robustness against adversarial examples for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). As a variant of AT, Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has demonstrated its superior performance in improving the robustness of small student models with the guidance of large teacher models. However, both AT and ARD encounter the robust fairness problem: these models exhibit strong robustness when facing part of classes (easy class), but weak robustness when facing others (hard class). In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis of the potential factors and argue that the smoothness degree of samples' soft labels for different classes (i.e., hard class or easy class) will affect the robust fairness of DNNs from both empirical observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above finding, we propose an Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) method to mitigate the adversarial robust fairness problem within the framework of Knowledge Distillation (KD). Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between different classes to achieve fairness by adjusting the class-wise smoothness degree of samples' soft labels during the training process, and the smoothness degree of soft labels is controlled by assigning different temperatures in KD to different classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art AT, ARD, and robust fairness methods in the comprehensive metric (Normalized Standard Deviation) of robustness and fairness.

Improving Alignment and Robustness with Short Circuiting
AI systems are can take harmful actions and are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We present an approach, inspired by recent advances in representation engineering, that "short-circuits" models as they respond with harmful outputs. Existing techniques aimed at improving alignment, such as refusal training, are often bypassed. Techniques such as adversarial training try to plug these holes by countering specific attacks. Our approach directly controls the representations that are responsible for harmful outputs in the first place. Our technique can be applied to both text-only and multimodal language models to prevent the generation of harmful outputs without sacrificing utility---even in the presence of powerful unseen attacks. Notably, while adversarial robustness in standalone image recognition remains an open challenge, short-circuiting allows the larger multimodal system to reliably withstand image "hijacks" that aim to produce harmful content. Finally, we extend our approach to AI agents, demonstrating considerable reductions in the rate of harmful actions and when they are under attack. Our approach represents a significant step forward in the development of reliable safeguards to harmful behavior and adversarial attacks.

Improving Decision Sparsity
Sparsity is a central aspect of interpretability in machine learning. Typically, sparsity is measured in terms of the size of a model globally, such as the number of variables it uses. However, this notion of sparsity is not particularly relevant for decision making; someone subjected to a decision does not care about variables that do not contribute to the decision. In this work, we dramatically expand a notion of *decision sparsity* called the *Sparse Explanation Value* (SEV) so that its explanations are more meaningful. SEV considers movement along a hypercube towards a reference point. By allowing flexibility in that reference and by considering how distances along the hypercube translate to distances in feature space, we can derive sparser and more meaningful explanations for various types of function classes. We present cluster-based SEV and its variant tree-based SEV, introduce a method that improves credibility of explanations, and propose algorithms that optimize decision sparsity in machine learning models.

Improving Environment Novelty Quantification for Effective Unsupervised Environment Design
Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) formalizes the problem of adaptive curricula in underspecified environments through interactive training between a teacher agent and a student agent. The teacher generates new training environments with high learning potential and curates an adaptive curriculum, ultimately enhancing the student's ability to handle unseen scenarios. Existing UED methods primarily rely on regret, a metric that measures the difference between the agent's optimal and actual performance, to shape the training curriculum. Regret-driven methods generate curricula that progressively increase environment complexity for the student but overlook environment novelty — a critical element for enhancing an agent's generalization ability. Directly quantifying environment novelty is especially challenging due to the underspecified nature of environment parameters in UED, which entails there is a one to many mapping between an instantiation of environment parameters and the actual environments corresponding to that set of parameter values. Due to this, existing approaches to measuring novelty based on environment parameters face significant hurdles. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the GMM-based Evaluation of Novelty In Environments (GENIE) framework. GENIE offers a scalable, domain-agnostic, and agent (student) policy-aware approach to quantifying environment novelty by using Gaussian Mixture Models. By augmenting regret-based UED algorithms with novelty-based objectives, GENIE facilitates effective exploration across the state-action space while progressively increasing curriculum complexity. We provide empirical evaluations that demonstrate GENIE providing SOTA results on zero-shot out-of-distribution performance across all the UED benchmarks in the literature.

Improving Equivariant Model Training via Constraint Relaxation
Equivariant neural networks have been widely used in a variety of applications due to their ability to generalize well in tasks where the underlying data symmetries are known. Despite their successes, such networks can be difficult to optimize and require careful hyperparameter tuning to train successfully. In this work, we propose a novel framework for improving the optimization of such models by relaxing the hard equivariance constraint \emph{during} training: We relax the equivariance constraint of the network's intermediate layers by introducing an additional non-equivariance term that we progressively constrain until we arrive at an equivariant solution. By controlling the magnitude of the activation of the additional relaxation term, we allow the model to optimize over a larger hypothesis space containing approximate equivariant networks and converge back to an equivariant solution at the end of training. We provide experimental results on different state-of-the-art network architectures, demonstrating how this training framework can result in equivariant models with improved generalization performance.

Improving Generalization and Convergence by Enhancing Implicit Regularization
In this work, we propose an Implicit Regularization Enhancement (IRE) framework to accelerate the discovery of flat solutions in deep learning, thereby improving generalization and convergence. Specifically, IRE decouples the dynamics of flat and sharp directions, which boosts the sharpness reduction along flat directions while maintaining the training stability in sharp directions. We show that IRE can be practically incorporated with *generic base optimizers* without introducing significant computational overload. Experiments show that IRE consistently improves the generalization performance for image classification tasks across a variety of benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and models (ResNets and ViTs). Surprisingly, IRE also  achieves a $2\times$ *speed-up* compared to AdamW in the pre-training of Llama models (of sizes ranging from 60M to 229M) on datasets including Wikitext-103, Minipile, and Openwebtext. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees, showing that IRE can substantially accelerate the convergence towards flat minima in Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM).

Improving Gloss-free Sign Language Translation by Reducing Representation Density
Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) aims to develop well-performing SLT systems with no requirement for the costly gloss annotations, but currently still lags behind gloss-based approaches significantly. In this paper, we identify a **representation density problem** that could be a bottleneck in restricting the performance of gloss-free SLT. Specifically, the representation density problem describes that the visual representations of semantically distinct sign gestures tend to be closely packed together in feature space, which makes gloss-free methods struggle with distinguishing different sign gestures and suffer from a sharp performance drop. To address the representation density problem, we introduce a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely {\fancyname}, which encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative feature representation in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed SignCL can significantly reduce the representation density and improve performance across various translation frameworks. Specifically, SignCLachieves a significant improvement in BLEU score for the Sign Language Transformer and GFSLT-VLP on the CSL-Daily dataset by 39\% and 46\%, respectively, without any increase of model parameters. Compared to Sign2GPT, a state-of-the-art method based on large-scale pre-trained vision and language models, SignCLachieves better performance with only 35\% of its parameters. We will release our code and model to facilitate further research.

Improving Linear System Solvers for Hyperparameter Optimisation in Iterative Gaussian Processes
Scaling hyperparameter optimisation to very large datasets remains an open problem in the Gaussian process community. This paper focuses on iterative methods, which use linear system solvers, like conjugate gradients, alternating projections or stochastic gradient descent, to construct an estimate of the marginal likelihood gradient. We discuss three key improvements which are applicable across solvers: (i) a pathwise gradient estimator, which reduces the required number of solver iterations and amortises the computational cost of making predictions, (ii) warm starting linear system solvers with the solution from the previous step, which leads to faster solver convergence at the cost of negligible bias, (iii) early stopping linear system solvers after a limited computational budget, which synergises with warm starting, allowing solver progress to accumulate over multiple marginal likelihood steps. These techniques provide speed-ups of up to $72\times$ when solving to tolerance, and decrease the average residual norm by up to $7\times$ when stopping early.

Improving Neural Network Surface Processing with Principal Curvatures
The modern study and use of surfaces is a research topic grounded in centuries of mathematical and empirical inquiry. From a mathematical point of view, curvature is an invariant that characterises the intrinsic geometry and the extrinsic shape of a surface. Yet, in modern applications the focus has shifted away from finding expressive representations of surfaces, and towards the design of efficient neural network architectures to process them. The literature suggests a tendency to either overlook the representation of the processed surface, or use overcomplicated representations whose ability to capture the essential features of a surface is opaque. We propose using curvature as the input of neural network architectures for surface processing, and explore this proposition through experiments making use of the \textit{shape operator}. Our results show that using curvature as input leads to significant a increase in performance on segmentation and classification tasks, while allowing far less computational overhead than current methods

Improving optimal control and estimation methods adapted to the noise characteristics of the sensorimotor system
A pivotal brain computation relies on the ability to sustain perception-action loops. Stochastic optimal control theory offers a mathematical framework to explain this process at the algorithmic level through optimality principles. However, incorporating a realistic noise model of the sensorimotor system — accounting for multiplicative noise in feedback and motor output, as well as internal noise in estimation — makes the problem challenging. Currently, the algorithm that is commonly used is the one proposed in (Todorov, 2005). After discovering some pitfalls in the original derivation, i.e., unbiased estimation does not hold in the presence of internal noise, we improve the algorithm by proposing an efficient gradient descent-based optimization that minimizes the cost-to-go while only imposing linearity of the control law. The optimal solution is obtained by iteratively propagating in closed form the sufficient statistics to compute the expected cost and then minimizing this cost with respect to the filter and control gains. We show that this approach features an overall lower cost than current state-of-the-art solutions when internal noise is present. Providing the optimal control law in these cases is crucial for problems such as inverse control inference under rationality assumptions.

Improving robustness to corruptions with multiplicative weight perturbations
Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel on clean images but struggle with corrupted ones. Incorporating specific corruptions into the data augmentation pipeline can improve robustness to those corruptions but may harm performance on clean images and other types of distortion. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach that improves the robustness of DNNs to a wide range of corruptions without compromising accuracy on clean images. We first demonstrate that input perturbations can be mimicked by multiplicative perturbations in the weight space. Leveraging this, we propose Data Augmentation via Multiplicative Perturbation (DAMP), a training method that optimizes DNNs under random multiplicative weight perturbations. We also examine the recently proposed Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (ASAM) and show that it optimizes DNNs under adversarial multiplicative weight perturbations. Experiments on image classification datasets (CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet and ImageNet) and neural network architectures (ResNet50, ViT-S/16) show that DAMP enhances model generalization performance in the presence of corruptions across different settings. Notably, DAMP is able to train a ViT-S/16 on ImageNet from scratch, reaching the top-1 error of 23.7% which is comparable to ResNet50 without extensive data augmentations.

Improving self-training under distribution shifts via anchored confidence with theoretical guarantees
Self-training often falls short under distribution shifts due to an increased discrepancy between prediction confidence and actual accuracy. This typically necessitates computationally demanding methods such as neighborhood or ensemble-based label corrections. Drawing inspiration from insights on early learning regularization, we develop a principled method to improve self-training under distribution shifts based on temporal consistency. Specifically, we build an uncertainty-aware temporal ensemble with a simple relative thresholding. Then, this ensemble smooths noisy pseudo labels to promote selective temporal consistency. We show that our temporal ensemble is asymptotically correct and our label smoothing technique can reduce the optimality gap of self-training. Our extensive experiments validate that our approach consistently improves self-training performances by 8% to 16% across diverse distribution shift scenarios without a computational overhead. Besides, our method exhibits attractive properties, such as improved calibration performance and robustness to different hyperparameter choices.

Improving Sparse Decomposition of Language Model Activations with Gated Sparse Autoencoders
Recent work has found that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are an effective technique for unsupervised discovery of interpretable features in language models' (LMs) activations, by finding sparse, linear reconstructions of those activations. We introduce the Gated Sparse Autoencoder (Gated SAE), which achieves a Pareto improvement over training with prevailing methods. In SAEs, the L1 penalty used to encourage sparsity introduces many undesirable biases, such as shrinkage -- systematic underestimation of feature activations. The key insight of Gated SAEs is to separate the functionality of (a) determining which directions to use and (b) estimating the magnitudes of those directions: this enables us to apply the L1 penalty only to the former, limiting the scope of undesirable side effects. Through training SAEs on LMs of up to 7B parameters we find that, in typical hyper-parameter ranges, Gated SAEs solve shrinkage, are similarly interpretable, and require half as many firing features to achieve comparable reconstruction fidelity.

Improving Subgroup Robustness via Data Selection
Machine learning models can often fail on subgroups that are underrepresentedduring training. While dataset balancing can improve performance onunderperforming groups, it requires access to training group annotations and canend up removing large portions of the dataset. In this paper, we introduceData Debiasing with Datamodels (D3M), a debiasing approachwhich isolates and removes specific training examples that drive the model'sfailures on minority groups. Our approach enables us to efficiently traindebiased classifiers while removing only a small number of examples, and doesnot require training group annotations or additional hyperparameter tuning.

Improving the Learning Capability of Small-size Image Restoration Network by Deep Fourier Shifting Operator over Resource-limited Scene
State-of-the-art image restoration methods currently face challenges in terms of computational requirements and performance, making them impractical for deployment on edge devices such as phones and resource-limited devices. As a result, there is a need to develop alternative solutions with efficient designs that can achieve comparable performance to transformer or large-kernel methods. This motivates our research to explore techniques for improving the capability of small-size image restoration standing on the success secret of large receptive filed.Targeting at expanding receptive filed, spatial-shift operator tailored for efficient spatial communication and  has achieved remarkable advances in high-level image classification tasks, like $S^2$-MLP and ShiftVit. However, its potential has rarely been explored in low-level image restoration tasks. The underlying reason behind this obstacle is that image restoration is sensitive to the spatial shift that occurs due to severe region-aware information loss, which exhibits a different behavior from high-level tasks. To address this challenge and unleash the potential of spatial shift for image restoration, we propose an information-lossless shifting operator, i.e., Deep Fourier Shifting, that is customized for image restoration. To develop our proposed operator, we first revisit the principle of shift operator and apply it to the Fourier domain, where the shift operator can be modeled in an information-lossless Fourier cycling manner. Inspired by Fourier cycling, we design two variants of Deep Fourier Shifting, namely the amplitude-phase variant and the real-imaginary variant. These variants are generic operators that can be directly plugged into existing image restoration networks as a drop-in replacement for the standard convolution unit, consuming fewer parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple low-level tasks including image denoising, low-light image enhancement, guided image super-resolution, and image de-blurring demonstrate consistent performance gains obtained by our Deep Fourier Shifting while reducing the computation burden. Additionally, ablation studies verify the robustness of the shift displacement with stable performance improvement.

Improving the Training of Rectified Flows
Diffusion models have shown great promise for image and video generation, but sampling from state-of-the-art models requires expensive numerical integration of a generative ODE. One approach for tackling this problem is rectified flows, which iteratively learn smooth ODE paths that are less susceptible to truncation error. However, rectified flows still require a relatively large number of function evaluations (NFEs). In this work, we propose improved techniques for training rectified flows, allowing them to compete with knowledge distillation methods even in the low NFE setting. Our main insight is that under realistic settings, a single iteration of the Reflow algorithm for training rectified flows is sufficient to learn nearly straight trajectories; hence, the current practice of using multiple Reflow iterations is unnecessary. We thus propose techniques to improve one-round training of rectified flows, including a U-shaped timestep distribution and LPIPS-Huber premetric. With these techniques, we improve the FID of the previous 2-rectified flow by up to 72\% in the 1 NFE setting on CIFAR-10. On ImageNet 64$\times$64, our improved rectified flow outperforms the state-of-the-art distillation methods such as consistency distillation and progressive distillation in both one-step and two-step settings and rivals the performance of improved consistency training (iCT) in FID. We also showcase other advantages of rectified flows, e.g., multi-step sampling with advanced solvers and few-step inversion.

Improving the Worst-Case Bidirectional Communication Complexity for Nonconvex Distributed Optimization under Function Similarity
Effective communication between the server and workers plays a key role in distributed optimization. In this paper, we focus on optimizing communication, uncovering inefficiencies in prevalent downlink compression approaches. Considering first the pure setup where the uplink communication costs are negligible, we introduce MARINA-P, a novel method for downlink compression, employing a collection of correlated compressors. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that MARINA-P with permutation compressors can achieve a server-to-worker communication complexity improving with the number of workers, thus being provably superior to existing algorithms. We further show that MARINA-P can serve as a starting point for extensions such as methods supporting bidirectional compression: we introduce M3, a method combining MARINA-P with uplink compression and a momentum step, achieving bidirectional compression with provable improvements in total communication complexity as the number of workers increases. Theoretical findings align closely with empirical experiments, underscoring the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

Improving Viewpoint-Independent Object-Centric Representations through Active Viewpoint Selection
Given the complexities inherent in visual scenes, such as object occlusion, a comprehensive understanding often requires observation from multiple viewpoints. Existing multi-viewpoint object-centric learning methods typically employ random or sequential viewpoint selection strategies. While applicable across various scenes, these strategies may not always be ideal, as certain scenes could benefit more from specific viewpoints. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel active viewpoint selection strategy. This strategy predicts the images from unknown viewpoints based on information from observation images for each scene. It then compares the object-centric representations extracted from both viewpoints and selects the unknown viewpoint with the largest disparity, indicating the greatest increase in information, as the next observation viewpoint. Through experiments on various datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our active viewpoint selection strategy, significantly enhancing segmentation and reconstruction performance compared to random viewpoint selection. Moreover, our method can accurately predict images from unknown viewpoints.

Improving Visual Prompt Tuning by Gaussian Neighborhood Minimization for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition
Long-tailed visual recognition has received increasing attention recently. Despite fine-tuning techniques represented by visual prompt tuning (VPT) achieving substantial performance improvement by leveraging pre-trained knowledge, models still exhibit unsatisfactory generalization performance on tail classes. To address this issue, we propose a novel optimization strategy called Gaussian neighborhood minimization prompt tuning (GNM-PT), for VPT to address the long-tail learning problem. We introduce a novel Gaussian neighborhood loss, which provides a tight upper bound on the loss function of data distribution, facilitating a flattened loss landscape correlated to improved model generalization. Specifically, GNM-PT seeks the gradient descent direction within a random parameter neighborhood, independent of input samples, during each gradient update. Ultimately, GNM-PT enhances generalization across all classes while simultaneously reducing computational overhead. The proposed GNM-PT achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 90.3%, 76.5%, and 50.1% on benchmark datasets CIFAR100-LT (IR 100), iNaturalist 2018, and Places-LT, respectively. The source code is temporarily available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GNM-PT/.

In-and-Out: Algorithmic Diffusion for Sampling Convex Bodies
We present a new random walk for uniformly sampling high-dimensional convex bodies. It achieves state-of-the-art runtime complexity with stronger guarantees on the output than previously known, namely in Rényi divergence (which implies TV, $\mathcal{W}_2$, KL, $\chi^2$). The proof departs from known approaches for polytime algorithms for the problem - we utilize a stochastic diffusion perspective to show contraction to the target distribution with the rate of convergence determined by functional isoperimetric constants of the stationary density.

In-Context Learning of a Linear Transformer Block: Benefits of the MLP Component and One-Step GD Initialization
We study the \emph{in-context learning} (ICL) ability of a \emph{Linear Transformer Block} (LTB) that combines a linear attention component and a linear multi-layer perceptron (MLP) component. For ICL of linear regression with a Gaussian prior and a \emph{non-zero mean}, we show that LTB can achieve nearly Bayes optimal ICL risk. In contrast, using only linear attention must incur an irreducible additive  approximation error. Furthermore, we establish a correspondence between LTB and one-step gradient descent estimators with learnable initialization ($\mathsf{GD}-\beta$), in the sense that every $\mathsf{GD}-\beta$ estimator can be implemented by an LTB estimator and every optimal LTB estimator that minimizes the in-class ICL risk is effectively a $\mathsf{GD}-\beta$ estimator.Finally, we show that $\mathsf{GD}-\beta$ estimators can be efficiently optimized with gradient flow, despite a non-convex training objective.Our results reveal that LTB achieves ICL by implementing $\mathsf{GD}-\beta$, and they highlight the role of MLP layers in reducing approximation error.

In-Context Learning with Representations: Contextual Generalization of Trained Transformers
In-context learning (ICL) refers to a remarkable capability of pre-trained large language models, which can learn a new task given a few examples during inference. However, theoretical understanding of in-context learning is largely under-explored, particularly whether transformers can be trained to generalize to unseen examples in a prompt, which will require the model to acquire the contextual knowledge of the prompt for generalization. This paper investigates the training dynamics of transformers by gradient descent through the lens of non-linear regression tasks. The contextual generalization here can be attained via the in-context learning of the template  function for each task, where all template functions lie in a linear space with $m$ basis functions. We analyze the training dynamics of multi-head transformers to {in-contextly} predict unlabeled inputs given partially labeled prompts where the labels contain Gaussian noise and there may be only a few examples in each prompt which are not sufficient to determine the template. We show that the training loss for a shallow multi-head transformer converge linearly to a global minimum. Moreover, the transformer effectively learns to perform ridge regression. To our knowledge, this study is the first of showing that transformers can learn contextual (i.e., template) information to generalize to unseen examples when prompts contain only a small number of query-answer pairs.

In-Context Learning with Transformers: Softmax Attention Adapts to Function Lipschitzness
A striking property of transformers is their ability to perform in-context learning (ICL), a machine learning framework in which the learner is presented with a novel context during inference implicitly through some data, and tasked with making a prediction in that context. As such, that learner must adapt to the context without additional training. We explore the role of *softmax* attention in an ICL setting where each context encodes a regression task. We show that an attention unit learns a window that it uses to implement a nearest-neighbors predictor adapted to the landscape of the pretraining tasks. Specifically, we show that this window widens with decreasing Lipschitzness and increasing label noise in the pretraining tasks. We also show that on low-rank, linear problems, the attention unit learns to project onto the appropriate subspace before inference. Further, we show that this adaptivity relies crucially on the softmax activation and thus cannot be replicated by the linear activation often studied in prior theoretical analyses.

Incorporating Surrogate Gradient Norm to Improve Offline Optimization Techniques
Offline optimization has recently emerged as an increasingly popular approach to mitigate the prohibitively expensive cost of online experimentation. The key idea is to learn a surrogate of the black-box function that underlines the target experiment using a static (offline) dataset of its previous input-output queries. Such an approach is, however, fraught with an out-of-distribution issue where the learned surrogate becomes inaccurate outside the offline data regimes. To mitigate this, existing offline optimizers have proposed numerous conditioning techniques to prevent the learned surrogate from being too erratic. Nonetheless, such conditioning strategies are often specific to particular surrogate or search models, which might not generalize to a different model choice. This motivates us to develop a model-agnostic approach instead, which incorporates a notion of model sharpness into the training loss of the surrogate as a regularizer. Our approach is supported by a new theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing surrogate sharpness on the offline dataset provably reduces its generalized sharpness on unseen data. Our analysis extends existing theories from bounding generalized prediction loss (on unseen data) with loss sharpness to bounding the worst-case generalized surrogate sharpness with its empirical estimate on training data, providing a new perspective on sharpness regularization. Our extensive experimentation on a diverse range of optimization tasks also shows that reducing surrogate sharpness often leads to significant improvement, marking (up to) a noticeable 9.6% performance boost.

Incremental Learning of Retrievable Skills For Efficient Continual Task Adaptation
Continual Imitation Learning (CiL) involves extracting and accumulating task knowledge from demonstrations across multiple stages and tasks to achieve a multi-task policy. With recent advancements in foundation models, there has been a growing interest in adapter-based CiL approaches, where adapters are established parameter-efficiently for tasks newly demonstrated. While these approaches isolate parameters for specific tasks and tend to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, they limit knowledge sharing among different demonstrations. We introduce IsCiL, an adapter-based CiL framework that addresses this limitation of knowledge sharing by incrementally learning shareable skills from different demonstrations, thus enabling sample-efficient task adaptation using the skills particularly in non-stationary CiL environments. In IsCiL, demonstrations are mapped into the state embedding space, where proper skills can be retrieved upon input states through prototype-based memory. These retrievable skills are incrementally learned on their corresponding adapters. Our CiL experiments with complex tasks in the Franka-Kitchen and Meta-World demonstrate the robust performance of IsCiL in both task adaptation and sample-efficiency. We also show a simple extension of IsCiL for task unlearning scenarios.

Induced Model Matching: Restricted Models Help Train Full-Featured Models
We consider scenarios where a very accurate predictive model using restricted features is available at the time of training of a larger, full-featured, model. This restricted model may be thought of as ``side-information'', derived either from an auxiliary exhaustive dataset or on the same dataset, by forcing the restriction. How can the restricted model be useful to the full model? We propose an approach for transferring the knowledge of the restricted model to the full model, by aligning the full model's context-restricted performance with that of the restricted model's. We call this methodology Induced Model Matching (IMM) and first illustrate its general applicability by using logistic regression as a toy example. We then explore IMM's use in language modeling, the application that initially inspired it, and where it offers an explicit foundation in contrast to the implicit use of restricted models in techniques such as noising. We demonstrate the methodology on both LSTM and transformer full models, using $N$-grams as restricted models. To further illustrate the potential of the principle whenever it is much cheaper to collect restricted rather than full information, we conclude with a simple RL example where POMDP policies can improve learned MDP policies via IMM.

Inexact Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Conic Optimization: Quadratic Growth and Linear Convergence
Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALMs) are widely employed in solving constrained optimizations, and some efficient solvers are developed based on this framework. Under the quadratic growth assumption, it is known that the dual iterates and the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) residuals of ALMs applied to conic programs converge linearly. In contrast, the convergence rate of the primal iterates has remained elusive. In this paper, we resolve this challenge by establishing new $\textit{quadratic growth}$ and $\textit{error bound}$ properties for primal and dual conic programs under the standard strict complementarity condition. Our main results reveal that both primal and dual iterates of the ALMs converge linearly contingent solely upon the assumption of strict complementarity and a bounded solution set. This finding provides a positive answer to an open question regarding the asymptotically linear convergence of the primal iterates of ALMs applied to conic optimization.

Infinite Limits of Multi-head Transformer Dynamics
In this work we analyze various scaling limits of the training dynamics of transformer models in the feature learning regime. We identify the set of parameterizations which admit well defined infinite width and depth limits that allow the attention layers to update throughout training, a relevant notion of feature learning in these models. We then use tools from dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) to analyze various infinite limits (infinite heads, infinite key/query dimension, and infinite depth) which have different statistical descriptions depending on which infinite limit is taken and how attention layers are scaled. We provide numerical evidence of convergence to the limits and show they maintain the correct scale of updates for both SGD and Adam.

Inflationary Flows: Calibrated Bayesian Inference with Diffusion-Based Models
Beyond estimating parameters of interest from data, one of the key goals of statistical inference is to properly quantify uncertainty in these estimates. In Bayesian inference, this uncertainty is provided by the posterior distribution, the computation of which typically involves an intractable high-dimensional integral. Among available approximation methods, sampling-based approaches come with strong theoretical guarantees but scale poorly to large problems, while variational approaches scale well but offer few theoretical guarantees. In particular, variational methods are known to produce overconfident estimates of posterior uncertainty and are typically non-identifiable, with many latent variable configurations generating equivalent predictions. Here, we address these challenges by showing how diffusion-based models (DBMs), which have recently produced state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling tasks, can be repurposed for performing calibrated, identifiable Bayesian inference. By exploiting a previously established connection between the stochastic and probability flow ordinary differential equations (pfODEs) underlying DBMs, we derive a class of models, \emph{inflationary flows,} that uniquely and deterministically map high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional Gaussian distribution via ODE integration. This map is both invertible and neighborhood-preserving, with controllable numerical error, with the result that uncertainties in the data are correctly propagated to the latent space. We demonstrate how such maps can be learned via standard DBM training using a novel noise schedule and are effective at both preserving and reducing intrinsic data dimensionality. The result is a class of highly expressive generative models, uniquely defined on a low-dimensional latent space, that afford principled Bayesian inference.

Information-theoretic Generalization Analysis for Expected Calibration Error
While the expected calibration error (ECE), which employs binning, is widely adopted to evaluate the calibration performance of machine learning models, theoretical understanding of its estimation bias is limited. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the estimation bias in the two common binning strategies, uniform mass and uniform width binning.Our analysis establishes upper bounds on the bias, achieving an improved convergence rate. Moreover, our bounds reveal, for the first time, the optimal number of bins to minimize the estimation bias. We further extend our bias analysis to generalization error analysis based on the information-theoretic approach, deriving upper bounds that enable the numerical evaluation of how small the ECE is for unknown data. Experiments using deep learning models show that our bounds are nonvacuous thanks to this information-theoretic generalization analysis approach.

Information-theoretic Limits of Online Classification with Noisy Labels
We study online classification with general hypothesis classes where the true labels are determined by some function within the class, but are corrupted by *unknown* stochastic noise, and the features are generated adversarially. Predictions are made using observed *noisy* labels and noiseless features, while the performance is  measured via minimax risk when comparing against *true* labels. The noisy mechanism is modeled via a general noisy kernel that specifies, for any individual data point, a set of distributions from which the actual noisy label distribution is chosen. We show that minimax risk is *tightly* characterized (up to a logarithmic factor of the hypothesis class size) by the *Hellinger gap* of the noisy label distributions induced by the kernel, *independent* of other properties such as the means and variances of the noise. Our main technique is based on a novel reduction to an online comparison scheme of two hypotheses, along with a new *conditional* version of Le Cam-Birgé testing suitable for online settings. Our work provides the first comprehensive characterization of noisy online classification with guarantees that apply to the *ground truth* while addressing *general* noisy observations.

Initialization is Critical to Whether Transformers Fit Composite Functions by Inference or Memorizing
Transformers have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks, but their performance on compositional problems remains a topic of debate. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms of how transformers behave on unseen compositional tasks.  We discover that the parameter initialization scale plays a critical role in determining whether the model learns inferential solutions, which capture the underlying compositional primitives, or symmetric solutions, which simply memorize mappings without understanding the compositional structure. By analyzing the information flow and vector representations within the model, we reveal the distinct mechanisms underlying these solution types. We further find that inferential solutions exhibit low complexity bias, which we hypothesize is a key factor enabling them to learn individual mappings for single anchors. Building upon the understanding of these mechanisms, we can predict the learning behavior of models with different initialization scales when faced with data of varying complexity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of initialization scale in shaping the type of solution learned by transformers and their ability to learn and generalize compositional tasks.

Initializing Variable-sized Vision Transformers from Learngene with Learnable Transformations
In practical scenarios, it is necessary to build variable-sized models to accommodate diverse resource constraints, with weight initialization serving as a crucial step preceding training. The recently introduced Learngene framework firstly learns one compact module, termed learngene, from a large well-trained model, and then transforms learngene to initialize variable-sized models. However, the existing Learngene methods provide limited guidance on transforming learngene, where transformation mechanisms are manually designed and generally lack a learnable component. Moreover, these methods only consider transforming learngene along depth dimension, thus constraining the flexibility of learngene. Motivated by these concerns, we propose a novel and effective Learngene approach termed LeTra (Learnable Transformations), where we transform the learngene module along both depth and width dimension with a set of learnable transformation matrices for flexible variable-sized model initialization. Specifically, we design an auxiliary model comprising the compact learngene module and learnable transformations, enabling the training of both modules. Given the differing sizes of the target models, we select specific parameters from well-trained transformations to transform learngene under the guidance of several well-designed strategies including continuous selection, step-wise selection and random selection. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that Des-Nets initialized via LeTra outperform those trained from scratch after only 1 epoch tuning. When transferring to downstream datasets, LeTra achieves better results while reducing around 30× training costs compared to training from scratch. Compared to pre-training and fine-tuning method, LeTra demonstrates superior performance while notably reducing around 9.8× initialization parameters and 3.8× pre-training costs.

In-N-Out: Lifting 2D Diffusion Prior for 3D Object Removal via Tuning-Free Latents Alignment
Neural representations for 3D scenes have made substantial advancements recently, yet object removal remains a challenging yet practical issue, due to the absence of multi-view supervision over occluded areas.  Diffusion Models (DMs), trained on extensive 2D imagesd, show diverse and high-fidelity generative capabilities in 2D domain. However, due to not specifically trained on 3D data, their application to multi-view data often exacerbate inconsistency, hence impacts overall quality of the 3D output. To address these issues, we introduce ``In-N-Out'', a novel approach that begins by \underline{in}painting a prior, i.e., the occluded area from a single view using DMs, followed by \underline{out}stretching it to create multi-view inpaintings via latents alignments. Our analysis identifies that the variability in DMs' outputs mainly arises from initial sampled latents, and intermediate latents predicted in the denoising process. We explicitly align of \textbf{initial} latents using a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to establish a consistent foundational structure in the inpainted area,  complemented by an implicit alignment of \textbf{intermediate} latents through cross-view attention during the denoising phases, enhancing appearance consistency across views. To further enhance rendering results, we apply a patch-based hybrid loss to optimize NeRF. We demonstrate that our techniques effectively mitigate the challenges posed by inconsistencies in DMs and substantially improve the fidelity and coherence of inpainted 3D representations.

In Pursuit of Causal Label Correlations for Multi-label Image Recognition
Multi-label image recognition aims to predict all objects present in an input image.  A common belief is that modeling the correlations between objects is beneficial for multi-label recognition.  However, this belief has been recently challenged as label correlations may mislead the classifier in testing,   due to the possible contextual bias in training. Accordingly, a few of recent works not only discarded label correlation   modeling, but also advocated to remove contextual information for multi-label image recognition.  This work explicitly explores label correlations for multi-label image  recognition based on a principled causal intervention approach.   With causal intervention, we pursue causal label correlations and suppress spurious label correlations,  as the former tend to convey useful contextual cues while the later may mislead the classifier. Specifically, we decouple  label-specific features with a Transformer decoder attached to the backbone network, and model the confounders which  may give rise to spurious correlations by clustering spatial features of all training images.   Based on label-specific features and confounders, we employ a cross-attention module to implement causal intervention,  quantifying the causal correlations from all object categories to each predicted object category.   Finally, we obtain image labels by combining the predictions from decoupled features and causal label correlations.  Extensive experiments clearly validate the effectiveness of our approach for multi-label image recognition  in both common and cross-dataset settings.

InstructG2I: Synthesizing Images from Multimodal Attributed Graphs
In this paper, we approach an overlooked yet critical task Graph2Image: generating images from multimodal attributed graphs (MMAGs). This task poses significant challenges due to the explosion in graph size, dependencies among graph entities, and the need for controllability in graph conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a graph context-conditioned diffusion model called InstructG2I. InstructG2I first exploits the graph structure and multimodal information to conduct informative neighbor sampling by combining personalized page rank and re-ranking based on vision-language features. Then, a graph QFormer encoder adaptively encodes the graph nodes into an auxiliary set of graph prompts to guide the denoising process of diffusion. Finally, we propose graph classifier-free guidance, enabling controllable generation by varying the strength of graph guidance and multiple connected edges to a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our approach. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Graph2Image-submit-607E/.

Interactive Deep Clustering via Value Mining
In the absence of class priors, recent deep clustering methods resort to data augmentation and pseudo-labeling strategies to generate supervision signals. Though achieved remarkable success, existing works struggle to discriminate hard samples at cluster boundaries, mining which is particularly challenging due to their unreliable cluster assignments. To break such a performance bottleneck, we propose incorporating user interaction to facilitate clustering instead of exhaustively mining semantics from the data itself. To be exact, we present Interactive Deep Clustering (IDC), a plug-and-play method designed to boost the performance of pre-trained clustering models with minimal interaction overhead. More specifically, IDC first quantitatively evaluates sample values based on hardness, representativeness, and diversity, where the representativeness avoids selecting outliers and the diversity prevents the selected samples from collapsing into a small number of clusters. IDC then queries the cluster affiliations of high-value samples in a user-friendly manner. Finally, it utilizes the user feedback to finetune the pre-trained clustering model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IDC could remarkably improve the performance of various pre-trained clustering models, at the expense of low user interaction costs. The code will be released publically.

InterpBench: Semi-Synthetic Transformers for Evaluating Mechanistic Interpretability Techniques
Mechanistic interpretability methods aim to identify the algorithm a neural network implements, but it is difficult to validate such methods when the algorithm is unknown. This work presents InterpBench, a collection of semi-synthetic yet realistic transformers with known circuits for evaluating these techniques. We propose Strict Interchange Intervention Training (SIIT) to create these models. Like plain Interchange Intervention Training (IIT), SIIT trains neural networks to align with high-level causal models, but it improves on IIT by also preventing non-circuit nodes from affecting the model's output. We evaluate SIIT on sparse transformers produced by the Tracr tool and find that SIIT models maintain Tracr's original circuit while being more realistic. SIIT can also train transformers with larger circuits, like Indirect Object Identification (IOI). Finally, we use our benchmark to evaluate existing circuit discovery techniques.

Interpolating Item and User Fairness in Multi-Sided Recommendations
Today's online platforms heavily lean on algorithmic recommendations for bolstering user engagement and driving revenue. However, these recommendations can impact multiple stakeholders simultaneously---the platform, items (sellers), and users (customers)---each with their unique objectives, making it difficult to find the right middle ground that accommodates all stakeholders. To address this, we introduce a novel fair recommendation framework, Problem (FAIR), that flexibly balances multi-stakeholder interests via a constrained optimization formulation. We next explore Problem (FAIR) in a dynamic online setting where data uncertainty further adds complexity, and propose a low-regret algorithm FORM that concurrently performs real-time learning and fair recommendations, two tasks that are often at odds. Via both theoretical analysis and a numerical case study on real-world data, we demonstrate the efficacy of our framework and method in maintaining platform revenue while ensuring desired levels of fairness for both items and users.

Interpretable Image Classification with Adaptive Prototype-based Vision Transformers
We present ProtoViT, a method for interpretable image classification combining deep learning and case-based reasoning. This method classifies an image by comparing it to a set of learned prototypes, providing explanations of the form ``this looks like that.'' In our model, a prototype consists of **parts**, which can deform over irregular geometries to create a better comparison between images. Unlike existing models that rely on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbones and spatially rigid prototypes, our model integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones into prototype based models, while offering spatially deformed prototypes that not only accommodate geometric variations of objects but also provide coherent and clear prototypical feature representations with an adaptive number of prototypical parts. Our experiments show that our model can generally achieve higher performance than the existing prototype based models. Our comprehensive analyses ensure that the prototypes are consistent and the interpretations are faithful.

Interpretable Lightweight Transformer via Unrolling of Learned Graph Smoothness Priors
We build interpretable and lightweight transformer-like neural networks by unrolling iterative optimization algorithms that minimize graph smoothness priors---the quadratic graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) and the $\ell_1$-norm graph total variation (GTV)---subject to an interpolation constraint. The crucial insight is that a normalized signal-dependent graph learning module amounts to a variant of the basic self-attention mechanism in conventional transformers. Unlike "black-box" transformers that require learning of large key, query and value matrices to compute scaled dot products as affinities and subsequent output embeddings, resulting in huge parameter sets, our unrolled networks employ shallow CNNs to learn low-dimensional features per node to establish pairwise Mahalanobis distances and construct sparse similarity graphs. At each layer, given a learned graph, the target interpolated signal is simply a low-pass filtered output derived from the minimization of an assumed graph smoothness prior, leading to a dramatic reduction in parameter count. Experiments for two image interpolation applications verify the restoration performance, parameter efficiency and robustness to covariate shift of our graph-based unrolled networks compared to conventional transformers.

Interpretable Machine Learning for Datasets with Missing Values
Many important datasets contain samples that are missing one or more features. Maintaining the interpretability of machine learning models in the presence of this missing data is challenging. Singly or multiply imputing missing values complicates the model’s mapping from features to labels. On the other hand, reasoning on indicator variables that represent missingness introduces a potentially large number of additional terms, sacrificing sparsity. We solve these problems with M-GAM, a sparse generalized additive modeling approach that incorporates missingness indicators and their interaction terms while maintaining sparsity through $\ell_0$ regularization. We show that M-GAM provides similar or superior accuracy to prior methods while significantly improving sparsity relative to either imputation or naive inclusion of indicator variables.

Interpretable Mesomorphic Networks for Tabular Data
Even though neural networks have been long deployed in applications involving tabular data, still existing neural architectures are not explainable by design. In this paper, we propose a new class of interpretable neural networks for tabular data that are both deep and linear at the same time (i.e. mesomorphic). We optimize deep hypernetworks to generate explainable linear models on a per-instance basis. As a result, our models retain the accuracy of black-box deep networks while offering free-lunch explainability for tabular data by design. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our explainable deep networks have comparable performance to state-of-the-art classifiers on tabular data and outperform current existing methods that are explainable by design.

Interpreting CLIP with Sparse Linear Concept Embeddings (SpLiCE)
CLIP embeddings have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of multimodal applications. However, these high-dimensional, dense vector representations are not easily interpretable,  limiting our understanding of the rich structure of CLIP and its use in downstream applications that require transparency. In this work, we show that the semantic structure of CLIP's latent space can be leveraged to provide interpretability, at no cost to downstream performance, by decomposing representations into semantic concepts. We formulate this problem as one of sparse recovery and  propose a novel method, Sparse Linear Concept Embeddings (SpLiCE), for transforming CLIP representations into sparse linear combinations of human-interpretable concepts. Distinct from previous work, SpLiCE is task-agnostic and can be used, without training, to explain and even replace traditional dense CLIP representations, maintaining equivalent downstream performance while significantly improving their interpretability. We also demonstrate several use cases of SpLiCE representations including detecting spurious correlations and model editing. Code is provided at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpLiCE-7EAD/.

Interpreting the Weight Space of Customized Diffusion Models
We investigate the space of weights spanned by a large collection of customized diffusion models. We populate this space by creating a dataset of over 60,000 model weights, each of which is fine-tuned to insert a different person's identity. Next, we model the underlying manifold of these weights as a subspace, which we term $\textit{weights2weights}$. We demonstrate three immediate applications of this space -- sampling, editing, and inversion. First, as each point in the space corresponds to an identity, sampling a set of weights from it results in a model encoding a novel identity. Next, we find linear directions in this space corresponding to semantic edits of the identity (e.g., adding a beard). These edits persist in appearance across generated samples. Finally, we show that inverting a single image into this space reconstructs a realistic identity, even if the input image is out of distribution (e.g., a painting). Our results indicate that the weight space of fine-tuned diffusion models behaves as an interpretable latent space of identities.

Intervention and Conditioning in Causal Bayesian Networks
Causal models are crucial for understanding complex systems andidentifying causal relationships among variables. Even though causalmodels are extremely popular, conditional probability calculation offormulas involving interventions pose significant challenges.In case of Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs), Pearl assumes autonomy of mechanisms that determine interventions to calculate a range ofprobabilities. We show that by making simple yetoften realistic independence assumptions, it is possible to uniquely estimate the probability of an interventional formula (includingthe well-studied notions of probability of sufficiency and necessity). We discuss when these assumptions are appropriate.Importantly, in many cases of interest, when the assumptions are appropriate,these probability estimates can be evaluated usingobservational data, which carries immense significance in scenarioswhere conducting experiments is impractical or unfeasible.

IntraMix: Intra-Class Mixup Generation for Accurate Labels and Neighbors
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great performance in various tasks, with the core idea of gaining knowledge from labels and aggregating messages within the neighborhood. However, the prevailing challenges in most graphs are twofold: insufficient accurate (high-quality) labels and adequate neighbors for nodes, resulting in weak GNNs. Existing graph augmentation methods designed for these issues often tackle only one. Moreover, they either require extra training costs for generators, rely on overly simplistic strategies, or need substantial prior knowledge, all of which result in weak generalization abilities. To simultaneously address both of the two challenges faced by graphs in a generalized way, we propose an elegant method called IntraMix. IntraMix innovatively employs Mixup among low-quality (inaccurate) labeled data of the same class, generating high-quality labeled data at minimal cost. Additionally, it finds data with high confidence of being clustered into the same group as the generated data to serve as their neighbors, thereby enriching the neighborhoods of graphs. IntraMix efficiently tackles both issues faced by graphs and challenges the prior notion of the limited effectiveness of Mixup in node classification. IntraMix is a theoretically grounded plug-in-play framework that can be readily applied to all GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IntraMix across various GNNs and datasets.

Intrinsic Robustness of Prophet Inequality to Strategic Reward Signaling
Prophet inequality concerns a basic optimal stopping problem and states that simple threshold stopping policies --- i.e., accepting the first reward larger than a certain threshold --- can achieve tight $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation to the optimal prophet value. Motivated by its economic applications, this paper studies the robustness of this approximation to natural strategic manipulations in which each random reward is associated with a self-interested player who may selectively reveal his realized reward to the searcher in order to maximize his probability of being selected. We say a threshold policy is $\alpha$(-strategically)-robust if it (a) achieves the  $\alpha$-approximation to the prophet value for strategic players; and (b) meanwhile remains a  $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation in the standard non-strategic setting.Starting with a characterization of each player's optimal information revealing strategy, we demonstrate the intrinsic robustness of prophet inequalities to strategic reward signaling through the following results:(1) for arbitrary reward distributions, there is a threshold policy that is $\frac{1-\frac{1}{e}}{2}$-robust, and this ratio is tight;(2) for i.i.d. reward distributions, there is a threshold policy that is $\frac{1}{2}$-robust, which is tight for the setting; and (3) for log-concave (but non-identical) reward distributions, the $\frac{1}{2}$-robustness can also be achieved under certain regularity assumptions.

Invariant subspaces and PCA in nearly matrix multiplication time
Approximating invariant subspaces of generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs) is a fundamental computational problem at the core of machine learning and scientific computing. It is, for example, the root of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and noise filtering, and of Density Functional Theory (DFT), arguably the most popular method to calculate the electronic structure of materials. For a  GEP $HC=SC\Lambda$, let $\Pi_k$ be the true spectral projector on the invariant subspace that is associated with the $k$ smallest (or largest) eigenvalues. Given $H,$ $S$, an integer $k$, and accuracy $\epsilon\in(0,1)$, we show that we can compute a matrix $\widetilde\Pi_k$ such that $\lVert\Pi_k-\widetilde\Pi_k\rVert_2\leq \epsilon$, in $O\left( n^{\omega+\eta}\mathrm{polylog}(n,\epsilon^{-1},\kappa(S),\mathrm{gap}_k^{-1}) \right)$ bit operations in the floating point model with probability $1-1/n$. Here, $\eta>0$ is arbitrarily small, $\omega\lesssim 2.372$ is the matrix multiplication exponent, $\kappa(S)=\lVert S\rVert_2\lVert S^{-1}\rVert_2$, and $\mathrm{gap}_k$ is the gap between eigenvalues $k$ and $k+1$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end analysis achieving such $\text{``forward-error''}$ approximation guarantees with nearly $O(n^{\omega+\eta})$ bit complexity, improving classical $\widetilde O(n^3)$ eigensolvers, even for the regular case where $S=I$. Our methods rely on a new $O(n^{\omega+\eta})$ stability analysis for the Cholesky factorization, and a new smoothed analysis for computing spectral gaps, which can be of independent interest.Ultimately, we obtain new matrix multiplication-type bit complexity upper bounds for PCA problems, including classical PCA and (randomized) low-rank approximation.

Inverse Factorized Soft Q-Learning for Cooperative Multi-agent Imitation Learning
This paper concerns imitation learning (IL) in cooperative multi-agent systems.The learning problem under consideration poses several challenges, characterized by high-dimensional state and action spaces and intricate inter-agent dependencies. In a single-agent setting, IL was shown to be done efficiently via an inverse soft-Q learning process. However, extending this framework to a multi-agent context introduces the need to simultaneously learn both local value functions to capture local observations and individual actions, and a joint value function for exploiting centralized learning.In this work, we introduce a new multi-agent IL algorithm designed to address these challenges. Our approach enables thecentralized learning by leveraging mixing networks to aggregate  decentralized Q functions.We further establish conditions for the mixing networks under which the multi-agent IL objective function exhibits convexity within the Q function space.We present  extensive experiments conducted on some challenging multi-agent game environments, including an advanced version of the Star-Craft multi-agent challenge (SMACv2), which demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm.

InversionView: A General-Purpose Method for Reading Information from Neural Activations
The inner workings of neural networks can be better understood if we can fully decipher the information encoded in neural activations. In this paper, we argue that this information is embodied by the subset of inputs that give rise to similar activations. Computing such subsets is nontrivial as the input space is exponentially large. We propose InversionView, which allows us to practically inspect this subset by sampling from a trained decoder model conditioned on activations. This helps uncover the information content of activation vectors, and facilitates understanding of the algorithms implemented by transformer models. We present three case studies where we investigate models ranging from small transformers to GPT-2. In these studies, we demonstrate the characteristics of our method, show the distinctive advantages it offers, and provide causally verified circuits.

Invisible Image Watermarks Are Provably Removable Using Generative AI
Invisible watermarks safeguard images’ copyright by embedding hidden messages only detectable by owners. They also prevent people from misusing images, especially those generated by AI models. We propose a family of regeneration attacks to remove these invisible watermarks. The proposed attack method first adds random noise to an image to destroy the watermark and then reconstructs the image. This approach is flexible and can be instantiated with many existing image-denoising algorithms and pre-trained generative models such as diffusion models. Through formal proofs and empirical results, we demonstrate that pixel-level invisible watermarks are vulnerable to the proposed attack. For a particularly resilient watermark, RivaGAN, regeneration attacks remove 93-99% of the invisible watermarks while the baseline attacks remove no more than 3%. However, watermarks that keep the image semantically similar can be an alternative defense against our attack. Our finding underscores the need for a shift in research/industry emphasis from invisible watermarks to semantic-preserving watermarks. We provide the code in the supplementary materials.

IPM-LSTM: A Learning-Based Interior Point Method for Solving Nonlinear Programs
Solving constrained nonlinear programs (NLPs) is of great importance in various domains such as power systems, robotics, and wireless communication networks. One widely used approach for addressing NLPs is the interior point method (IPM). The most computationally expensive procedure in IPMs is to solve systems of linear equations via matrix factorization. Recently, machine learning techniques have been adopted to expedite classic optimization algorithms. In this work, we propose using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to approximate the solution of linear systems and integrate this approximating step into an IPM. The resulting approximate NLP solution is then utilized to warm-start an interior point solver. Experiments on various types of NLPs, including Quadratic Programs and Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs, show that our approach can significantly accelerate NLP solving, reducing iterations by up to 60% and solution time by up to 70% compared to the default solver.

IR-CM: The Fast and Universal Image Restoration Method Based on Consistency Model
This paper proposes a fast and general-purpose image restoration method. The key idea is to achieve few-step or even one-step inference by conducting consistency distilling or training on a specific mean-reverting stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, based on this, we propose a novel linear-nonlinear decoupling training strategy, significantly enhancing training effectiveness and surpassing consistency distillation on inference performance. This allows our method to be independent of any pre-trained checkpoint, enabling it to serve as an effective standalone image-to-image transformation model. Finally, to avoid trivial solutions and stabilize model training, we introduce a simple origin-guided loss. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on tasks including image deraining, denoising, deblurring, and low-light image enhancement. The experiments show that our method achieves highly competitive results with only one-step inference. And with just two-step inference, it can achieve state-of-the-art performance in low-light image enhancement. Furthermore, a number of ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training strategy. our code is available at https://github.com.

Is Cross-validation the Gold Standard to Evaluate Model Performance?
Cross-Validation (CV) is the default choice for evaluating the performance of machine learning models. Despite its wide usage, their statistical benefits have remained half-understood, especially in challenging nonparametric regimes. In this paper we fill in this gap and show that in fact, for a wide spectrum of models, CV does not statistically outperform the simple "plug-in" approach where one reuses training data for testing evaluation. Specifically, in terms of both the asymptotic bias and coverage accuracy of the associated interval for out-of-sample evaluation, $K$-fold CV provably cannot outperform plug-in regardless of the rate at which the parametric or nonparametric models converge. Leave-one-out CV can have a smaller bias as compared to plug-in; however, this bias improvement is negligible compared to the variability of the evaluation, and in some important cases leave-one-out again does not outperform plug-in once this variability is taken into account. We obtain our theoretical comparisons via a novel higher-order Taylor analysis that allows us to derive necessary conditions for limit theorems of testing evaluations, which applies to model classes that are not amenable to previously known sufficient conditions. Our numerical results demonstrate that plug-in performs indeed no worse than CV across a wide range of examples.

Is Knowledge Power? Dissecting Information Asymmetry In Repeated Games
When learning in strategic environments, a key question is whether agents can overcome uncertainty about their preferences to achieve outcomes they could have achieved absent any uncertainty. Can they do this solely through interactions with each other? We focus this question on the ability of agents to attain the value of their Stackelberg optimal strategy and study the impact of information asymmetry.We study repeated interactions in fully strategic environments where players' actions are decided based on learning algorithms that take into account their observed histories and knowledge of the game. We study the pure Nash equilibria (PNE) of a meta-game where players choose these algorithms as their actions. We demonstrate that if one player has perfect knowledge about the game, then any initial informational gap persists. That is, while there is always a PNE in which the informed agent achieves her Stackelberg value, there is a game where no PNE of the meta-game allows the partially informed player to achieve her Stackelberg value.On the other hand, if both players start with some uncertainty about the game, the quality of information alone does not determine which agent can achieve her Stackelberg value.In this case, the concept of information asymmetry becomes nuanced and depends on the game's structure. Overall, our findings suggest that repeated strategic interactions alone cannot facilitate learning effectively enough to earn an uninformed player her Stackelberg value.

Is Mamba Compatible with Trajectory Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning?
Transformer-based trajectory optimization methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL), yet it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba in offline RL (dubbed DeMa) from the aspect of data structures and network architectures with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements due to the fact that DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify that the hidden attention mechanism is key to its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations from eight Atari games demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, outdoing Decision Transformer (DT) by 80\% with 30\% fewer parameters, and exceeds DT in MuJoCo with only a quarter of the parameters.

Is One GPU Enough? Pushing Image Generation at Higher-Resolutions with Foundation Models.
In this work, we introduce Pixelsmith, a zero-shot text-to-image generative framework to sample images at higher resolutions with a single GPU. We are the first to show that it is possible to scale the output of a pre-trained diffusion model by a factor of 1000, opening the road to gigapixel image generation at no extra cost. Our cascading method uses the image generated at the lowest resolution as baseline to sample at higher resolutions. For the guidance, we introduce the Slider, a mechanism that fuses the overall structure contained in the first-generated image with enhanced fine details. At each inference step, we denoise patches rather than the entire latent space, minimizing memory demands so that a single GPU can handle the process, regardless of the image's resolution. Our experimental results show that this method not only achieves higher quality and diversity compared to existing techniques but also reduces sampling time and ablation artifacts.

Is Score Matching Suitable for Estimating Point Processes?
Score matching estimators for point processes have gained widespread attention in recent years because they do not require the calculation of intensity integrals, thereby effectively addressing the computational challenges in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Some existing works have proposed score matching estimators for point processes. However, this work demonstrates that the incompleteness of the estimators proposed in those works renders them applicable only to specific problems, and they fail for more general point processes. To address this issue, this work introduces the weighted score matching estimator to point processes. Theoretically, we prove the consistency of the estimator we propose. Experimental results indicate that our estimator accurately estimates model parameters on synthetic data and yields results consistent with MLE on real data. In contrast, existing score matching estimators fail to perform effectively.

Is the MMI Criterion Necessary for Explanation? Degenerating Non-causal Features to Plain Noise
An important line of research in the field of explainability is to extract a small subset of crucial clues from the full input. The most widely used criterion for clue extraction is the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion. However, in certain datasets, there are spurious features non-causally correlated with the label and also get high mutual information, complicating the loss landscape of MMI. Although some penalty-based methods have been developed to penalize the spurious features (e.g., invariance penalty, intervention penalty, etc) to help MMI work better, these are merely remedial measures. In the optimization objectives of these methods, spurious features are still distinguished from plain noise, which hinders the discovery of causal clues. This paper aims to develop a new criterion that treats spurious features as plain noise, allowing the model to work on datasets rich in spurious features as if it were working on clean datasets, thereby making clue extraction easier. We theoretically observe that removing either plain noise or spurious features from the input does not alter the conditional distribution of the remaining components relative to the task label. However, significant changes in the conditional distribution occur only when causal features are eliminated. Based on this discovery, the paper proposes a criterion for \textbf{M}aximizing the \textbf{R}emaining \textbf{D}iscrepancy (MRD). Experiments on six widely used datasets show that our MRD criterion improves clue quality (measured by the overlap with human-annotated clues) by up to $10.4\%$ as compared to several recent competitive MMI variants.

Is Your HD Map Constructor Reliable under Sensor Corruptions?
Driving systems often rely on high-definition (HD) maps for precise environmental information, which is crucial for planning and navigation. While current HD map constructors perform well under ideal conditions, their resilience to real-world challenges, e.g., adverse weather and sensor failures, is not well understood, raising safety concerns. This work introduces MapBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of HD map construction methods against various sensor corruptions. Our benchmark encompasses a total of 29 types of corruptions that occur from cameras and LiDAR sensors. Extensive evaluations across 31 HD map constructors reveal significant performance degradation of existing methods under adverse weather conditions and sensor failures, underscoring critical safety concerns.     We identify effective strategies for enhancing robustness, including innovative approaches that leverage multi-modal fusion, advanced data augmentation, and architectural techniques. These insights provide a pathway for developing more reliable HD map construction methods, which are essential for the advancement of autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit and affiliated code and model checkpoints have been made publicly accessible.

Iteration Head: A Mechanistic Study of Chain-of-Thought
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is known to improve Large Language Models both empirically and in terms of theoretical approximation power.However, our understanding of the inner workings and conditions of apparition of CoT capabilities remains limited.This paper helps fill this gap by demonstrating how CoT reasoning emerges in transformers in a controlled and interpretable setting.In particular, we observe the appearance of a specialized attention mechanism dedicated to iterative reasoning, which we coined "iteration heads".We track both the emergence and the precise working of these iteration heads down to the attention level, and measure the transferability of the CoT skills to which they give rise between tasks.

Iteratively Refined Behavior Regularization for Offline Reinforcement Learning
One of the fundamental challenges for offline reinforcement learning (RL) is ensuring robustness to data distribution. Whether the data originates from a near-optimal policy or not, we anticipate that an algorithm should demonstrate its ability to learn an effective control policy that seamlessly aligns with the inherent distribution of offline data. Unfortunately, behavior regularization, a simple yet effective offline RL algorithm, tends to struggle in this regard. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that substantially enhances behavior-regularization based on conservative policy iteration. Our key observation is that by iteratively refining the reference policy used for behavior regularization, conservative policy update guarantees gradually improvement, while also implicitly avoiding querying out-of-sample actions to prevent catastrophic learning failures. We prove that in the tabular setting this algorithm is capable of learning the optimal policy covered by the offline dataset, commonly referred to as the in-sample optimal policy. We then explore several implementation details of the algorithm when function approximations are applied. The resulting algorithm is easy to implement, requiring only a few lines of code modification to existing methods. Experimental results on the D4RL benchmark indicate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines in most tasks, clearly demonstrate its superiority over behavior regularization.

Iterative Methods via Locally Evolving Set Process
Given the damping factor $\alpha$ and precision tolerance $\epsilon$, \citet{andersen2006local} introduced Approximate Personalized PageRank (APPR), the \textit{de facto local method} for approximating the PPR vector, with runtime bounded by $\Theta(1/(\alpha\epsilon))$ independent of the graph size. Recently,  Fountoulakis \& Yang asked whether faster local algorithms could be developed using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon))$ operations. By noticing that APPR is a local variant of Gauss-Seidel, this paper explores the question of *whether standard iterative solvers can be effectively localized*. We propose to use the *locally evolving set process*, a novel framework to characterize the algorithm locality, and demonstrate that many standard solvers can be effectively localized. Let $\overline{\operatorname{vol}}{ (\mathcal S_t)}$ and $\overline{\gamma_t}$ be the running average of volume and the residual ratio of active nodes $\textstyle \mathcal{S_t}$ during the process. We show $\overline{\operatorname{vol}}{ (\mathcal S_t)}/\overline{\gamma_t} \leq 1/\epsilon$ and prove APPR admits a new runtime bound $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\overline{\operatorname{vol}}(\mathcal S_t)/(\alpha\overline{\gamma_t}))$ mirroring the actual performance. Furthermore, when the geometric mean of residual reduction is $\Theta(\sqrt{\alpha})$, then there exists $c \in (0,2)$ such that the local Chebyshev method has runtime $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\overline{\operatorname{vol}}(\mathcal{S_t})/(\sqrt{\alpha}(2-c)))$ without the monotonicity assumption. Numerical results confirm the efficiency of this novel framework and show up to a hundredfold speedup over corresponding standard solvers on real-world graphs.

IWBVT: Instance Weighting-based Bias-Variance Trade-off for Crowdsourcing
In recent years, a large number of algorithms for label integration and noise correction have been proposed to infer the unknown true labels of instances in crowdsourcing. They have made great advances in improving the label quality of crowdsourced datasets. However, due to the presence of intractable instances, these algorithms are usually not as significant in improving the model quality as they are in improving the label quality. To improve the model quality, this paper proposes an instance weighting-based bias-variance trade-off (IWBVT) approach. IWBVT at first proposes a novel instance weighting method based on the complementary set and entropy, which mitigates the impact of intractable instances and thus makes the bias and variance of trained models closer to the unknown true results. Then, IWBVT performs probabilistic loss regressions based on the bias-variance decomposition, which achieves the bias-variance trade-off and thus reduces the generalization error of trained models. Experimental results indicate that IWBVT can serve as a universal post-processing approach to significantly improving the model quality of existing state-of-the-art label integration algorithms and noise correction algorithms.

Jointly Modeling Inter- & Intra-Modality Dependencies for Multi-modal Learning
Supervised multi-modal learning involves mapping multiple modalities to a target label. Previous studies in this field have concentrated on capturing in isolation either the inter-modality dependencies (the relationships between different modalities and the label) or the intra-modality dependencies (the relationships within a single modality and the label). We argue that these conventional approaches that rely solely on either inter- or intra-modality dependencies may not be optimal in general. We view the multi-modal learning problem from the lens of generative models where we consider the target as a source of multiple modalities and the interaction between them. Towards that end, we propose inter- \& intra-modality modeling (I2M2) framework, which captures and integrates both the inter- and intra-modality dependencies, leading to more accurate predictions. We evaluate our approach using real-world healthcare and vision-and-language datasets with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods focusing only on one type of modality dependency.

Key-Grid: Unsupervised 3D Keypoints Detection using Grid Heatmap Features
Detecting 3D keypoints with semantic consistency is widely used in many scenarios such as pose estimation, shape registration and robotics. Currently, most unsupervised 3D keypoint detection methods focus on the rigid-body objects. However, when faced with deformable objects, the keypoints they identify do not preserve semantic consistency well. In this paper, we introduce an innovative unsupervised keypoint detector Key-Grid for both the rigid-body and deformable objects, which is an autoencoder framework. The encoder predicts keypoints and the decoder utilizes the generated keypoints to reconstruct the objects. Unlike previous work, we leverage the identified keypoint in formation to form a 3D grid feature heatmap called grid heatmap, which is used in the decoder section. Grid heatmap is a novel concept that represents the latent variables for grid points sampled uniformly in the 3D cubic space, where these variables are the shortest distance between the grid points and the “skeleton” connected by keypoint pairs. Meanwhile, we incorporate the information from each layer of the encoder into the decoder section. We conduct an extensive evaluation of Key-Grid on a list of benchmark datasets. Key-Grid achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the semantic consistency and position accuracy of keypoints. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of Key-Grid to noise and downsampling. In addition, we achieve SE-(3) invariance of keypoints though generalizing Key-Grid to a SE(3)-invariant backbone.

KFNN: K-Free Nearest Neighbor For Crowdsourcing
To reduce annotation costs, it is common in crowdsourcing to collect only a few noisy labels from different crowd workers for each instance. However, the limited noisy labels restrict the performance of label integration algorithms in inferring the unknown true label for the instance. Recent works have shown that leveraging neighbor instances can help alleviate this problem. Yet, these works all assume that each instance has the same neighborhood size, which defies common sense. To address this gap, we propose a novel label integration algorithm called K-free nearest neighbor (KFNN). In KFNN, the neighborhood size of each instance is automatically determined based on its attributes and noisy labels. Specifically, KFNN initially estimates a Mahalanobis distance distribution from the attribute space to model the relationship between each instance and all classes. This distance distribution is then utilized to enhance the multiple noisy label distribution of each instance. Subsequently, a Kalman filter is designed to mitigate the impact of noise incurred by neighbor instances. Finally, KFNN determines the optimal neighborhood size by the max-margin learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that KFNN significantly outperforms all the other state-of-the-art algorithms and exhibits greater robustness in various crowdsourcing scenarios.

Knowledge Circuit in Transformers
The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, has allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuit holds potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

KOALA: Empirical Lessons Toward Memory-Efficient and Fast Diffusion Models for Text-to-Image Synthesis
As text-to-image (T2I) synthesis models increase in size, they demand higher inference costs due to the need for more expensive GPUs with larger memory, which makes it challenging to reproduce these models in addition to the restricted access to training datasets. Our study aims to reduce these inference costs and explores how far the generative capabilities of T2I models can be extended using only publicly available datasets and open-source models. To this end, by using the de facto standard text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), we present three key practices in building an efficient T2I model: (1) Knowledge distillation: we explore how to effectively distill the generation capability of SDXL into an efficient U-Net and find that self-attention is the most crucial part. (2) Data: despite fewer samples, high-resolution images with rich captions are more crucial than a larger number of low-resolution images with short captions. (3) Teacher: Step-distilled Teacher allows T2I models to reduce the noising steps. Based on these findings, we build two types of efficient text-to-image models, called KOALA-Turbo & -Lightning, with two compact U-Nets (1B & 700M), reducing the model size up to 54% and 69% of the SDXL U-Net. In particular, the KOALA-Lightning-700M is 4 times faster than SDXL while still maintaining satisfactory generation quality. Moreover, unlike SDXL, our KOALA models can generate 1024px high-resolution images on consumer-grade GPUs with 8GB of VRAMs (3060Ti). We believe that our KOALA models will have a significant practical impact, serving as cost-effective alternatives to SDXL for academic researchers and general users in resource-constrained environments.

Label Delay in Online Continual Learning
Online continual learning, the process of training models on streaming data, has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, a critical aspect often overlooked is the label delay, where new data may not be labeled due to slow and costly annotation processes. We introduce a new continual learning framework with explicit modeling of the label delay between data and label streams over time steps. In each step, the framework reveals both unlabeled data from the current time step t and labels delayed with d steps, from the time step t−d. In our extensive experiments amounting to 1060 GPU days, we show that merely augmenting the computational resources is insufficient to tackle this challenge. Our findings underline a notable performance decline when solely relying on labeled data when the label delay becomes significant. More surprisingly, when using state-of-the-art SSL and TTA techniques to utilize the newer, unlabeled data, they fail to surpass the performance of a naïve method that simply trains on the delayed supervised stream. To this end, we introduce a simple, efficient baseline that rehearses from the labeled memory samples that are most similar to the new unlabeled samples. This method bridges the accuracy gap caused by label delay without significantly increasing computational complexity. We show experimentally that our method is the least affected by the label delay factor and in some cases successfully recovers the accuracy of the non-delayed counterpart. We conduct various ablations and sensitivity experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Label Noise: Ignorance Is Bliss
We establish a new theoretical framework for learning under multi-class, instance-dependent label noise. At the heart of our framework is the concept of \emph{relative signal strength}, which is a point-wise measure of noisiness. We use relative signal strength to establish matching upper and lower bounds for excess risk, and identify precise conditions that guarantee Bayes-consistency of a classifier learned from noisy labels. Our theoretical findings reveal a surprising result: the extremely simple \emph{Noise Ignorant Empirical Risk Minimization (NI-ERM)} principle, which conducts empirical risk minimization as if no label noise exists, is minimax optimal. Finally, we translate these theoretical insights into practice: by using NI-ERM to fit a linear classifier on top of a self-supervised feature extractor, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-N data challenge.

LaKD: Length-agnostic Knowledge Distillation for Trajectory Prediction with Any Length Observations
Trajectory prediction is a crucial technology to help systems avoid traffic accidents, ensuring safe autonomous driving. Previous methods typically use a fixed-length and sufficiently long trajectory of an agent as observations to predict its future trajectory. However, in real-world scenarios, we often lack the time to gather enough trajectory points before making predictions, e.g., when a car suddenly appears due to an obstruction, the system must make immediate predictions to prevent a collision. This poses a new challenge for trajectory prediction systems, requiring them to be capable of making accurate predictions based on observed trajectories of arbitrary lengths, leading to the failure of existing methods. In this paper, we propose a Length-agnostic Knowledge Distillation framework, named LaKD,  which can make accurate trajectory predictions, regardless of the length of observed data. Specifically, considering the fact that long trajectories, containing richer temporal information but potentially additional interference, may perform better or worse than short trajectories, we devise a dynamic length-agnostic knowledge distillation mechanism for exchanging information among trajectories of arbitrary lengths, dynamically determining the transfer direction based on prediction performance. In contrast to traditional knowledge distillation, LaKD employs a unique model that simultaneously serves as both the teacher and the student, potentially causing knowledge collision during the distillation process. Therefore, we design a dynamic soft-masking mechanism, where we first calculate the importance of neuron units and then apply soft-masking to them, so as to safeguard critical units from disruption during the knowledge distillation process. In essence, LaKD is a general and principled framework that can be naturally compatible with existing trajectory prediction models of different architectures. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, Argoverse 1, nuScenes and Argoverse 2, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

LAM3D: Large Image-Point Clouds Alignment Model for 3D Reconstruction from Single Image
Large Reconstruction Models have made significant strides in the realm of automated 3D content generation from single or multiple input images. Despite their success, these models often produce 3D meshes with geometric inaccuracies, stemming from the inherent challenges of deducing 3D shapes solely from image data. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, the Large Image and Point Cloud Alignment Model (LAM3D), which utilizes 3D point cloud data to enhance the fidelity of generated 3D meshes. Our methodology begins with the development of a point-cloud-based network that effectively generates precise and meaningful latent tri-planes, laying the groundwork for accurate 3D mesh reconstruction. Building upon this, our Image-Point-Cloud Feature Alignment technique processes a single input image, aligning to the latent tri-planes to imbue image features with robust 3D information. This process not only enriches the image features but also facilitates the production of high-fidelity 3D meshes without the need for multi-view input, significantly reducing geometric distortions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art high-fidelity 3D mesh reconstruction from a single image in just 6 seconds, and experiments on various datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.

Language-Driven Interactive Traffic Trajectory Generation
Realistic trajectory generation with natural language control is pivotal for advancing autonomous vehicle technology. However, previous methods focus on individual traffic participant trajectory generation, thus failing to account for the complexity of interactive traffic dynamics. In this work, we propose InteractTraj, the first language-driven traffic trajectory generator that can generate interactive traffic trajectories. InteractTraj interprets abstract trajectory descriptions into concrete formatted interaction-aware numerical codes and learns a mapping between these formatted codes and the final interactive trajectories. To interpret language descriptions, we propose a language-to-code encoder with a novel interaction-aware encoding strategy. To produce interactive traffic trajectories, we propose a code-to-trajectory decoder with interaction-aware feature aggregation that synergizes vehicle interactions with the environmental map and the vehicle moves. Extensive experiments show our method demonstrates superior performance over previous SoTA methods, offering a more realistic generation of interactive traffic trajectories with high controllability via diverse natural language commands.

Language Models as Hierarchy Encoders
Interpreting hierarchical structures latent in language is a key limitation of current language models (LMs). While previous research has implicitly leveraged these hierarchies to enhance LMs, approaches for their explicit encoding are yet to be explored. To address this, we introduce a novel approach to re-train transformer encoder-based LMs as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs), harnessing the expansive nature of hyperbolic space. Our method situates the output embedding space of pre-trained LMs within a Poincaré ball with a curvature that adapts to the embedding dimension, followed by re-training on hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses. These losses are designed to effectively cluster related entities (input as texts) and organise them hierarchically. We evaluate HiTs against pre-trained LMs, standard fine-tuned LMs, and several hyperbolic embedding baselines, focusing on their capabilities in simulating transitive inference, predicting subsumptions, and transferring knowledge across hierarchies. The results demonstrate that HiTs consistently outperform all baselines in these tasks, underscoring the effectiveness and transferability of our re-trained hierarchy encoders.

Large Stepsize Gradient Descent for Non-Homogeneous Two-Layer Networks: Margin Improvement and Fast Optimization
The typical training of neural networks using large stepsize gradient descent (GD) under the logistic loss often involves two distinct phases, where the empirical risk oscillates in the first phase but decreases monotonically in the second phase. We investigate this phenomenon in two-layer networks that satisfy a near-homogeneity condition. We show that the second phase begins once the empirical risk falls below a certain threshold, dependent on the stepsize. Additionally, we show that the normalized margin grows nearly monotonically in the second phase, demonstrating an implicit bias of GD in training non-homogeneous predictors. If the dataset is linearly separable and the derivative of the activation function is bounded away from zero, we show that the average empirical risk decreases, implying that the first phase must stop in finite steps. Finally, we demonstrate that by choosing a suitably large stepsize, GD that undergoes this phase transition is more efficient than GD that monotonically decreases the risk. Our analysis applies to networks of any width, beyond the well-known neural tangent kernel and mean-field regimes.

LaSCal: Label-Shift Calibration without target labels
When machine learning systems face dataset shift, model calibration plays a pivotal role in ensuring their reliability.Calibration error (CE) provides insights into the alignment between the predicted confidence scores and the classifier accuracy.While prior works have delved into the implications of dataset shift on calibration, existing CE estimators either (i) assume access to labeled data from the target domain, often unavailable in practice, or (ii) are derived under a covariate shift assumption. In this work we propose a novel, label-free, consistent CE estimator under label shift,  characterized by changes in the marginal label distribution p(Y), with a constant conditional p(X|Y) distribution between the source and target. Furthermore, we introduce a novel calibration method, called LaSCal, which uses the estimator in conjunction with a post-hoc calibration strategy, to perform unsupervised calibration on the target distribution. Our thorough empirical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach across different modalities, model architectures and label shift intensities.

LaSe-E2V: Towards Language-guided Semantic-Aware Event-to-Video Reconstruction
Event cameras harness advantages such as low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range (HDR), compared to standard cameras. Due to the distinct imaging paradigm shift, a dominant line of research focuses on event-to-video (E2V) reconstruction to bridge event-based and standard computer vision. However, this task remains challenging due to its inherently ill-posed nature: event cameras only detect the edge and motion information locally. Consequently, the reconstructed videos are often plagued by artifacts and regional blur, primarily caused by the ambiguous semantics of event data. In this paper, we find language naturally conveys abundant semantic information, rendering it stunningly superior in ensuring semantic consistency for E2V reconstruction.  Accordingly, we propose a novel framework, called LaSe-E2V, that can achieve semantic-aware high-quality E2V reconstruction from a language-guided perspective, buttressed by the text-conditional diffusion models. However, due to diffusion models' inherent diversity and randomness, it is hardly possible to directly apply them to achieve spatial and temporal consistency for E2V reconstruction. Thus, we first propose an Event-guided Spatiotemporal Attention (ESA) module to condition the event data to the denoising pipeline effectively. We then introduce an event-aware mask loss to ensure temporal coherence and a noise initialization strategy to enhance spatial consistency. Given the absence of event-text-video paired data, we aggregate existing E2V datasets and generate textual descriptions using the tagging models for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on three datasets covering diverse challenging scenarios (e.g., fast motion, low light) demonstrate the superiority of our method. Dataset and code will be available upon acceptance. A demo video is provided in the appendix.

Last-Iterate Convergence for Generalized Frank-Wolfe in Monotone Variational Inequalities
We study the behavior of a generalized Frank-Wolfe algorithm in constrained (stochastic) monotone variational inequality (MVI) problems. Recent years have seen many efforts in designing algorithms for solving constrained MVI problems due to their connections with optimization, machine learning, and equilibrium computation in games. The majority of work in this domain has focused on extensions of simultaneous gradient play, with particular emphasis on understanding the convergence properties of extragradient and optimistic gradient methods. In contrast, we study the performance of an algorithm drawn from another well-known class of optimization algorithms: Frank-Wolfe. We show that a generalized variant of this algorithm enjoys a fast $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$ last-iterate convergence in constrained MVI problems. By making connections between our generalized Frank-Wolfe with the well-known smoothed fictious-play (FP) from game theory, we also derive a finite-sample convergence rate for smoothed FP in zero-sum matrix games. Furthermore, we show that a stochastic variant of generalized Frank-Wolfe in MVI problems also converges in a last-iterate sense albeit at a slower $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/6})$ rate of convergence.

Latent Diffusion for Neural Spiking Data
Modern datasets in neuroscience enable unprecedented inquiries into the relationship between complex behaviors and the activity of many simultaneously recorded neurons. While latent variable models can successfully extract low-dimensional embeddings from such recordings, using them to generate realistic spiking data, especially in a behavior-dependent manner, still poses a challenge. Here, we present Latent Diffusion for Neural Spiking data (LDNS), a diffusion-based generative model with a low-dimensional latent space: LDNS employs an autoencoder with structured state-space (S4) layers to project discrete high-dimensional spiking data into continuous time-aligned latents. On these inferred latents, we train expressive (conditional) diffusion models, enabling us to sample neural activity with realistic single-neuron and population spiking statistics. We validate LDNS on synthetic data, accurately recovering latent structure, firing rates, and spiking statistics. Next, we demonstrate its flexibility by generating variable-length data that mimics human cortical activity during attempted speech. We show how to equip LDNS with an expressive observation model that accounts for single-neuron dynamics not mediated by the latent state, further increasing the realism of generated samples. Finally, conditional LDNS trained on motor cortical activity during diverse reaching behaviors can generate realistic spiking data given reach direction or unseen reach trajectories. In summary, LDNS simultaneously enables inference of low-dimensional latents and realistic conditional generation of neural spiking datasets, opening up further possibilities for simulating experimentally testable hypotheses.

Latent functional maps
Neural models learn data representations which lie on low dimensional manifolds, yet modelling the relation between these representational spaces is an ongoing challenge.By integrating spectral geometry principles into neural modeling, we show that this problem can be better addressed in the functional domain, mitigating complexity, while enhancing interpretability and performances on downstream tasks. To this end, we introduce a multi-purpose framework to the representation learning community which allows to: (i) compare different spaces in an interpretable way and measure their intrinsic similarity; (ii) find correspondences between them, both in unsupervised and weakly supervised settings, and (iii) to effectively transfer representations between distinct spaces.We validate our framework on various applications, ranging from stitching to retrieval tasks, demonstrating that latent functional maps can serve as swiss army knife for representation alignment.

Latent Intrinsics Emerge from Training to Relight
Image relighting is the task of showing what a scene from a source image would look like if illuminated differently.  Inverse graphic schemes recover an explicit representation of geometry and a set of chosen intrinsics, then relight with some form of renderer.  But error control for inverse graphics is difficult, and inverse graphics methods can represent only the effects of the chosen intrinsics. This paper describes a relighting method that is entirely data-driven, where intrinsics and lighting are each represented as latent variables.  Our approach produces SOTA relightings of real scenes, as measured by standard metrics.  We show that albedo can be recovered from our latent intrinsics without using any example albedos, and that the albedos recovered are competitive with SOTA methods.

Latent Neural Operator for Solving Forward and Inverse PDE Problems
Neural operators effectively solve PDE problems from data without knowing the explicit equations, which learn the map from the input sequences of observed samples to the predicted values. Most existed works build the model in the original geometric space, leading to high computational costs when the number of sample points is large. We present the Latent Neural Operator (LNO) solving PDEs in the latent space. In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA)  transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem.

Latent Representation Matters: Human-like Sketches in One-shot Drawing Tasks
Humans can effortlessly draw new categories from a single exemplar, a feat that has long posed a challenge for generative models. However, this gap has started to close with recent advances in diffusion models. This one-shot drawing task requires powerful inductive biases that have not been systematically investigated. Here, we study how different inductive biases shape the latent space of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). Along with standard LDM regularizers (KL and vector quantization), we explore supervised regularizations (including classification and prototype-based representation) and contrastive inductive biases (using  SimCLR and redundancy reduction objectives). We demonstrate that LDMs with redundancy reduction and prototype-based regularizations produce near-human-like drawings (regarding both samples' recognizability and originality) -- better mimicking human perception (as evaluated psychophysically). Overall, our results suggest that the gap between humans and machines in one-shot drawings is almost closed.

LCGen: Mining in Low-Certainty Generation for View-consistent Text-to-3D
The Janus Problem is a common issue in SDS-based text-to-3D methods. Due to view encoding approach and 2D diffusion prior guidance, the 3D representation model tends to learn content with higher certainty from each perspective, leading to view inconsistency. In this work, we first model and analyze the problem, visualizing the specific causes of the Janus Problem, which are associated with discrete view encoding and shared priors in 2D lifting. Based on this, we further propose the LCGen method, which guides text-to-3D to obtain different priors with different certainty from various viewpoints, aiding in view-consistent generation. Experiments have proven that our LCGen method can be directly applied to different SDS-based text-to-3D methods, alleviating the Janus Problem without introducing additional information, increasing excessive training burden, or compromising the generation effect.

LCM: Locally Constrained Compact Point Cloud Model for Masked Point Modeling
The pre-trained point cloud model based on Masked Point Modeling (MPM) has exhibited substantial improvements across various tasks. However, these models heavily rely on the Transformer, leading to quadratic complexity and limited decoder, hindering their practice application. To address this limitation, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing Transformer-based MPM, emphasizing the idea that redundancy reduction is crucial for point cloud analysis. To this end, we propose a Locally constrained Compact point cloud Model (LCM) consisting of a locally constrained compact encoder and a locally constrained Mamba-based decoder. Our encoder replaces self-attention with our local aggregation layers to achieve an elegant balance between performance and efficiency. Considering the varying information density between masked and unmasked patches in the decoder inputs of MPM, we introduce a locally constrained Mamba-based decoder. This decoder ensures linear complexity while maximizing the perception of point cloud geometry information from unmasked patches with higher information density. Extensive experimental results show that our compact model significantly surpasses existing Transformer-based models in both performance and efficiency, especially our LCM-based Point-MAE model, compared to the Transformer-based model, achieved an improvement of 2.24%, 0.87%, and 0.94% in performance on the three variants of ScanObjectNN while reducing parameters by 88% and computation by 73%. The code will be released.

Learning 3D Equivariant Implicit Function with Patch-Level Pose-Invariant Representation
Implicit neural representation gains popularity in modeling the continuous 3D surface for 3D representation and reconstruction. In this work, we are motivated by the fact that the local 3D patches repeatedly appear on 3D shapes/surfaces if removing the factor of poses. Based on this observation, we propose the 3D patch-level equivariant implicit function (PEIF) based on the 3D patch-level pose-invariant representation, allowing us to reconstruct 3D surfaces by estimating equivariant displacement vector fields for query points. Specifically, our model is based on the pose-normalized query/patch pairs and enhanced by the proposed intrinsic patch geometry representation, modeling the intrinsic 3D patch geometry feature by learnable multi-head memory banks. Extensive experiments show that PEIF achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple surface reconstruction datasets, and also exhibits better generalization to cross-dataset shapes and robustness to arbitrary rotations.

Learning a Single Neuron Robustly to Distributional Shifts and Adversarial Label Noise
We study the problem of learning a single neuron with respect to the $L_2^2$-loss in the presence of adversarial distribution shifts, where the labels can be arbitrary, and the goal is to find a "best-fit" function.More precisely, given training samples from a reference distribution $p_0$, the goal is to approximate the vector $\mathbf{w}^*$which minimizes the squared loss with respect to the worst-case distribution that is close in $\chi^2$-divergence to $p_{0}$.We design a computationally efficient algorithm that recovers a vector $ \hat{\mathbf{w}}$satisfying $\mathbb{E}\_{p^*} (\sigma(\hat{\mathbf{w}} \cdot \mathbf{x}) - y)^2 \leq C \hspace{0.2em}  \mathbb{E}\_{p^*} (\sigma(\mathbf{w}^* \cdot \mathbf{x}) - y)^2 + \epsilon$, where $C>1$ is a dimension-independent constant and $(\mathbf{w}^*, p^*)$ is the witness attaining the min-max risk$\min_{\mathbf{w}:\|\mathbf{w}\| \leq W} \max\_{p} \mathbb{E}\_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim p} (\sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) - y)^2 - \nu \chi^2(p, p_0)$.Our algorithm follows the primal-dual framework and is designed by directly bounding the risk with respect to the original, nonconvex $L_2^2$ loss.From an optimization standpoint, our work opens new avenues for the design of primal-dual algorithms under structured nonconvexity.

Learning-Augmented Algorithms for the Bahncard Problem
In this paper, we study learning-augmented algorithms for the Bahncard problem. The Bahncard problem is a generalization of the ski-rental problem, where a traveler needs to irrevocably and repeatedly decide between a cheap short-term solution and an expensive long-term one with an unknown future. Even though the problem is canonical, only a primal-dual-based learning-augmented algorithm was explicitly designed for it. We develop a new learning-augmented algorithm, named PFSUM, that incorporates both history and short-term future to improve online decision making. We derive the competitive ratio of PFSUM as a function of the prediction error and conduct extensive experiments to show that PFSUM outperforms the primal-dual-based algorithm.

Learning-Augmented Algorithms with Explicit Predictors
Recent advances in algorithmic design show how to utilize predictions obtained by machine learning models from past and present data. These approaches have demonstrated an enhancement in performance when the predictions are accurate, while also ensuring robustness by providing worst-case guarantees when predictions fail. In this paper we focus on online problems; prior research in this context was focused on a paradigm where the algorithms are oblivious of the predictors' design, treating them as a black box. In contrast, in this work,we unpack the predictor and integrate the learning problem it gives rise for within the algorithmic challenge. In particular we allow the predictor  to learn as it receives larger parts of the input, with the ultimate goal of designing online learning algorithms specifically tailored for the algorithmic task at hand. Adopting this perspective, we focus on a number of fundamental problems, including caching and scheduling, which have been well-studied in the black-box setting. For each of the problems, we introduce new algorithms that take advantage of explicit and carefully designed learning rules. These pairings of online algorithms with corresponding learning rules yields improvements in the overall performance in comparison with previous work.

Learning-Augmented Dynamic Submodular Maximization
In dynamic submodular maximization, the goal is to maintain a high-value solution over a sequence of element insertions and deletions with a fast update time. Motivated by large-scale applications and the fact that dynamic data often exhibits patterns, we ask the following question: can predictions be used to accelerate the update time of dynamic submodular maximization algorithms? We consider the model for dynamic algorithms with predictions where predictions regarding the insertion and deletion times of elements can be used for preprocessing. Our main result is an algorithm with an $O(\text{poly}(\log \eta, \log w, \log k))$ amortized update time over the sequence of updates that achieves a $1/2 - \epsilon$ approximation for dynamic monotone submodular maximization under a cardinality constraint $k$, where the prediction error $\eta$ is the number of elements that are not inserted and deleted within $w$ time steps of their predicted insertion and deletion times. This amortized update time is independent of the length of the stream and instead depends on the prediction error.

Learning-Augmented Priority Queues
Priority queues are one of the most fundamental and widely used data structures in computer science. Their primary objective is to efficiently support the insertion of new elements with assigned priorities and the extraction of the highest priority element.  In this study, we investigate the design of priority queues within the learning-augmented framework, where algorithms use potentially inaccurate predictions to enhance their worst-case performance.We examine three prediction models spanning different use cases, and we show how the predictions can be leveraged to enhance the performance of priority queue operations. Moreover, we demonstrate the optimality of our solution and discuss some possible applications.

Learning Bregman Divergences with Application to Robustness
We propose a novel and general method to learn Bregman divergences from raw high-dimensional data that measure similarity between images in pixel space. As a prototypical application, we learn divergences that consider real-world corruption of images (e.g., blur) as close to the original and noisy perturbations as far, even if in $L^p$-distance the opposite holds. We then define adversarial attacks by replacing the projected gradient descent (PGD) with the mirror descent associated with the learned Bregman divergence, and use them to improve the state-of-the-art in robustness through adversarial training for common image corruptions. In particular, for the contrast corruption that was found problematic in prior work we achieve an accuracy that exceeds the $L^p$- and the LPIPS-based adversarially trained neural networks by a margin of 27.16\% on the CIFAR-10-C corruption dataset.

Learning Commonality, Divergence and Variety for Unsupervised Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification
Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to match specified people in infrared images to visible images without annotation, and vice versa. USVI-ReID is a challenging yet under-explored task. Most existing methods address the USVI-ReID problem using cluster-based contrastive learning, which simply employs the cluster center as a representation of a person. However, the cluster center primarily focuses on commonality, overlooking divergencies. To address the problem, we propose a Progressive Contrastive Learning with Hard and Dynamic Prototypes method for USVI-ReID. In brief, we first generate the hard prototype by selecting the sample with the maximum distance from the cluster center. We theoretically show that the hard prototype is used in the contrastive loss to emphasize divergence. Additionally, instead of rigidly aligning query images to a specific prototype, we generate the dynamic prototype by randomly picking samples within a cluster. The dynamic prototype is used to encourage the variety of features. Finally, we introduce a progressive learning strategy to gradually shift the model's attention towards divergence and variety, avoiding cluster deterioration. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method with an average mAP improvement of 3.9%. The source codes will be released.

Learning Cut Generating Functions for Integer Programming
The branch-and-cut algorithm is the method of choice to solve large scale integer programming problems in practice. A key ingredient of branch-and-cut is the use of *cutting planes* which are derived constraints that reduce the search space for an optimal solution. Selecting effective cutting planes to produce small branch-and-cut trees is a critical challenge in the branch-and-cut algorithm. Recent advances have employed a data-driven approach to select optimal cutting planes from a parameterized family, aimed at reducing the branch-and-bound tree size (in expectation) for a given distribution of integer programming instances. We extend this idea to the selection of the best cut generating function (CGF), which is a tool in the integer programming literature for generating a wide variety of cutting planes that generalize the well-known Gomory Mixed-Integer (GMI) cutting planes. We provide rigorous sample complexity bounds for the selection of an effective CGF from certain parameterized families that provably performs well for any specified distribution on the problem instances. Our empirical results show that the selected CGF can outperform the GMI cuts for certain distributions. Additionally, we explore the sample complexity of using neural networks for instance-dependent CGF selection.

Learning Diffusion at Lightspeed
Diffusion regulates a phenomenal number of natural processes and the dynamics of many successful generative models. Existing models to learn the diffusion terms from observational data rely on complex bilevel optimization problems and properly model only the drift of the system.We propose a new simple model, JKOnet*, which bypasses altogether the complexity of existing architectures while presenting significantly enhanced representational capacity: JKOnet* recovers the potential, interaction, and internal energy components of the underlying diffusion process. JKOnet* minimizes a simple quadratic loss, runs at lightspeed, and drastically outperforms other baselines in practice. Additionally, JKOnet* provides a closed-form optimal solution for linearly parametrized functionals. Our methodology is based on the interpretation of diffusion processes as energy-minimizing trajectories in the probability space via the so-called JKO scheme, which we study via its first-order optimality conditions, in light of few-weeks-old advancements in optimization in the probability space.

Learning Diffusion Priors from Observations by Expectation Maximization
Diffusion models recently proved to be remarkable priors for Bayesian inverse problems. However, training these models typically requires access to large amounts of clean data, which could prove difficult in some settings. In this work, we present a novel method based on the expectation-maximization algorithm for training diffusion models from incomplete and noisy observations only. Unlike previous works, our method leads to proper diffusion models, which is crucial for downstream tasks. As part of our method, we propose and motivate a new posterior sampling scheme for unconditional diffusion models. We present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our method.

Learning Discrete Concepts in Latent Hierarchical Models
Learning concepts from natural high-dimensional data (e.g., images) holds potential in building human-aligned and interpretable machine learning models.    Despite its encouraging prospect, formalization and theoretical insights into this crucial task are still lacking.    In this work, we formalize concepts as discrete latent causal variables that are related via a hierarchical causal model that encodes different abstraction levels of concepts embedded in high-dimensional data (e.g., a dog breed and its eye shapes in natural images).    We formulate conditions to facilitate the identification of the proposed causal model, which reveals when learning such concepts from unsupervised data is possible.    Our conditions permit complex causal hierarchical structures beyond latent trees and multi-level directed acyclic graphs in prior work and can handle high-dimensional, continuous observed variables, which is well-suited for unstructured data modalities such as images.    We substantiate our theoretical claims with synthetic data experiments.    Further, we discuss our theory's implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of latent diffusion models and provide corresponding empirical evidence for our theoretical insights.

Learning Discrete Latent Variable Structures with Tensor Rank Conditions
Unobserved discrete data are ubiquitous in many scientific disciplines, and how to learn the causal structure of these latent variables is crucial for uncovering data patterns. Most studies focus on the linear latent variable model or impose strict constraints on latent structures, which fail to address cases in discrete data involving non-linear relationships or complex latent structures. To achieve this, we explore a tensor rank condition on contingency tables for an observed variable set $\mathbf{X}_p$, showing that the rank is determined by the minimum support of a specific conditional set (not necessary in $\mathbf{X}_p$) that d-separates all variables in $\mathbf{X}_p$. By this, one can locate the latent variable through probing the rank on different observed variables set, and further identify the latent causal structure under some structure assumptions. We present the corresponding identification algorithm and conduct simulated experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method. In general, our results elegantly extend the identification boundary for causal discovery with discrete latent variables and expand the application scope of causal discovery with latent variables.

Learning Distinguishable Trajectory Representation with Contrastive Loss
Policy network parameter sharing is a commonly used technique in advanced deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms to improve learning efficiency by reducing the number of policy parameters and sharing experiences among agents. Nevertheless, agents that share the policy parameters tend to learn similar behaviors. To encourage multi-agent diversity, prior works typically maximize the mutual information between trajectories and agent identities using variational inference. However, this category of methods easily leads to inefficient exploration due to limited trajectory visitations. To resolve this limitation, inspired by the learning of pre-trained models, in this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Trajectory Representation (CTR) method based on learning distinguishable trajectory representations to encourage multi-agent diversity. Specifically, CTR maps the trajectory of an agent into a latent trajectory representation space by an encoder and an autoregressive model. To achieve the distinguishability among trajectory representations of different agents, we introduce contrastive learning to maximize the mutual information between the trajectory representations and learnable identity representations of different agents. We implement CTR on top of QMIX and evaluate its performance in various cooperative multi-agent tasks. The empirical results demonstrate that our proposed CTR yields significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.

Learning Elastic Costs to Shape Monge Displacements
Given a source and a target probability measure supported on $\mathbb{R}^d$, the Monge problem asks to find the most efficient way to map one distribution to the other.This efficiency is quantified by defining a \textit{cost} function between source and target data. Such a cost is often set by default in the machine learning literature to the squared-Euclidean distance, $\ell^2_2(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\tfrac12\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\|_2^2$.Recently, Cuturi et. al '23 highlighted the  benefits of using elastic costs, defined through a regularizer $\tau$ as $c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\ell^2_2(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})+\tau(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})$. Such costs shape the \textit{displacements} of Monge maps $T$, i.e., the difference between a source point and its image $T(\mathbf{x})-\mathbf{x})$, by giving them a structure that matches that of the proximal operator of $\tau$.In this work, we make two important contributions to the study of elastic costs: *(i)* For any elastic cost, we propose a numerical method to compute Monge maps that are provably optimal. This provides a much-needed routine to create synthetic problems where the ground truth OT map is known, by analogy to the Brenier theorem, which states that the gradient of any convex potential is always a valid Monge map for the $\ell_2^2$ cost; *(ii)* We propose a loss to \textit{learn} the parameter $\theta$ of a parameterized regularizer $\tau_\theta$, and apply it in the case where $\tau_{A}(\mathbf{z})=\|A^\perp \mathbf{z}\|^2_2$. This regularizer promotes displacements that lie on a low dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^d$, spanned by the $p$ rows of $A\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times d}$. We illustrate the success of our procedure on synthetic data, generated using our first contribution, in which we show near-perfect recovery of $A$'s subspace using only samples. We demonstrate the applicability of this method by showing predictive improvements on single-cell data tasks.

Learning from higher-order correlations, efficiently: hypothesis tests, random features, and neural networks
Neural networks excel at discovering statistical patterns inhigh-dimensional data sets. In practice, higher-order cumulants, which quantifythe non-Gaussian correlations between three or more variables, are particularlyimportant for the performance of neural networks. But how efficient are neuralnetworks at extracting features from higher-order cumulants? We study thisquestion in the spiked cumulant model, where the statistician needs to recover aprivileged direction or "spike'' from the order-$p\ge 4$ cumulantsof $d$-dimensional inputs. We first discuss the fundamental statistical andcomputational limits of recovering the spike by analysing the number of samples $n$ required to strongly distinguish between inputs from the spikedcumulant model and isotropic Gaussian inputs. Existing literature established the presence of a wide statistical-to-computational gap in this problem. We deepen this line of work by finding an exact formula for the likelihood ratio norm which proves that statisticaldistinguishability requires $n\gtrsim d$ samples, while distinguishing the twodistributions in polynomial time requires $n \gtrsim d^2$ samples for a wideclass of algorithms, i.e. those covered by the low-degree conjecture. Numerical experiments show that neural networks do indeed learn to distinguishthe two distributions with quadratic sample complexity, while ``lazy'' methodslike random features are not better than random guessing in this regime. Ourresults show that neural networks extract information from higher-ordercorrelations in the spiked cumulant model efficiently, and reveal a large gap inthe amount of data required by neural networks and random features to learn fromhigher-order cumulants.

Learning from Noisy Labels via Conditional Distributionally Robust Optimization
While crowdsourcing has emerged as a practical solution for labeling extensive datasets, it presents a significant challenge in learning accurate models due to noisy labels contributed by annotators with diverse expertise. Existing approaches typically estimate the true label posterior conditional on the instance and noisy annotations to infer true labels or adjust loss functions. These estimates, however, ignore potential misspecification in the true label posterior, which can degrade model performances, particularly in scenarios with high noise ratios. To address this issue, we investigate learning from noisy annotations with estimated true label posterior through the lens of conditional distributionally robust optimization (CDRO). In particular, we propose formulating the problem as minimizing the worst-case risk within a distance-based ambiguity set centered around a reference distribution. By examining the strong duality of the formulation, we derive upper bounds for the worst-case risk. Additionally, we develop the analytical solution for the dual robust risk for each data point, which motivates a novel robust pseudo-label collection algorithm by leveraging the likelihood ratio test. This algorithm enables the construction of a pseudo-empirical distribution, serving as a more robust reference probability distribution in CDRO. Moreover, to devise an efficient algorithm for CDRO, we derive a closed-form expression for the empirical robust risk and the optimal Lagrange multiplier of the dual problem, facilitating a principled balance between robustness and model fitting. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Learning from Offline Foundation Features with Tensor Augmentations
We introduce Learning from Offline Foundation Features with Tensor Augmentations (LOFF-TA), an efficient training scheme designed to harness the capabilities of foundation models in limited resource settings where their direct development is not feasible. LOFF-TA involves training a compact classifier on cached feature embeddings  from a frozen foundation model, resulting in up to  $37\times$ faster training and up to $26\times$ reduced GPU memory usage. Because the embeddings of augmented images would be too numerous to store, yet the augmentation process is essential for training, we propose to apply tensor augmentations to the cached embeddings of the original non-augmented images. LOFF-TA makes it possible to leverage the power of foundation models, regardless of their size, in settings with limited computational capacity. Moreover, LOFF-TA can be used to apply foundation models to high-resolution images without increasing compute.    In certain scenarios, we find that training with LOFF-TA yields better results than directly fine-tuning the foundation model.

Learning from Pattern Completion: Self-supervised Controllable Generation
The human brain exhibits a strong ability to spontaneously associate different visual attributes of the same or similar visual scene, such as associating sketches and graffiti with real-world visual objects, usually without supervising information. In contrast, in the field of artificial intelligence, controllable generation methods like ControlNet heavily rely on annotated training datasets such as depth maps, semantic segmentation maps, and poses, which limits the method’s scalability. Inspired by the neural mechanisms that may contribute to the brain’s associative power, specifically the cortical modularization and hippocampal pattern completion, here we propose a self-supervised controllable generation (SCG) framework. Firstly, we introduce an equivariant constraint to promote inter-module independence and intra-module correlation in a modular autoencoder network, thereby achieving functional specialization. Subsequently, based on these specialized modules, we employ a self-supervised pattern completion approach for controllable generation training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modular autoencoder effectively achieves functional specialization, including the modular processing of color, brightness, and edge detection, and exhibits brain-like features including orientation selectivity, color antagonism, and center-surround receptive fields. Through self-supervised training, associative generation capabilities spontaneously emerge in SCG, demonstrating excellent generalization ability to various tasks such as associative generation on painting, sketches, and ancient graffiti. Compared to the previous representative method ControlNet, our proposed approach not only demonstrates superior robustness in more challenging high-noise scenarios but also possesses more promising scalability potential due to its self-supervised manner. Codes will be released on Github.

Learning from Snapshots of Discrete and Continuous Data Streams
Imagine a smart camera trap selectively clicking pictures to understand animal movement patterns within a particular habitat. These "snapshots", or pieces of data captured from a data stream at adaptively chosen times, provide a glimpse of different animal movements unfolding through time. Learning a continuous-time process through snapshots, such as camera traps, is a central theme governing a wide array of online learning situations. In this paper, we adopt a learning-theoretic perspective in understanding the fundamental nature of learning different classes of functions from both discrete data streams and continuous data streams. In our first framework, the update-and-deploy setting, a learning algorithm discretely queries from a process to update a predictor designed to make predictions given as input the data stream. We construct a uniform sampling algorithm that can learn with bounded error any concept class with finite Littlestone dimension. Our second framework, known as the blind-prediction setting, a learning algorithm generates predictions independently of observing the process, only engaging with the process when it chooses to make inquiries. Interestingly, we show a stark contrast in learnability where non-trivial concept classes are unlearnable. However, we find that there are natural pattern classes, sets of time-dependent and data-dependent functions, which are learnable in the blind-prediction and update-and-deploy settings given adaptive learning algorithms. Finally, we develop a theory of pattern classes under discrete data streams for the blind-prediction setting.

Learning from Uncertain Data: From Possible Worlds to Possible Models
We introduce an efficient method for learning linear models from uncertain data, where uncertainty is represented as a set of possible variations in the data, leading to predictive multiplicity. Our approach leverages abstract interpretation and zonotopes, a type of convex polytope, to compactly represent these dataset variations, enabling the symbolic execution of gradient descent on all possible worlds simultaneously. We develop techniques to ensure that this process converges to a fixed point and derive closed-form solutions for this fixed point. Our method provides sound over-approximations of all possible optimal models and viable prediction ranges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through theoretical and empirical analysis, highlighting its potential to reason about model and prediction uncertainty due to data quality issues in training data.

Learning Generalized Linear Programming Value Functions
We develop a theoretically-grounded learning method for the Generalized Linear Programming Value Function (GVF), which models the optimal value of a linear programming (LP) problem as its objective and constraint bounds vary. This function plays a fundamental role in algorithmic techniques for large-scale optimization, particularly in decomposition for two-stage mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). This paper establishes a structural characterization of the GVF that enables it to be modeled as a particular neural network architecture, which we then use to learn the GVF in a way that benefits from three notable properties. First, our method produces a true under-approximation of the value function with respect to the constraint bounds. Second, the model is input-convex in the constraint bounds, which not only matches the structure of the GVF but also enables the trained model to be efficiently optimized over using LP. Finally, our learning method is unsupervised, meaning that training data generation does not require computing LP optimal values, which can be prohibitively expensive at large scales.  We numerically show that our method can approximate the GVF well, even when compared to supervised methods that collect training data by solving an LP for each data point. Furthermore, as an application of our framework, we develop a fast heuristic method for large-scale two-stage MILPs with continuous second-stage variables, via a compact reformulation that can be solved faster than the full model linear relaxation at large scales and orders of magnitude faster than the original model.

Learning Group Actions on Latent Representations
In this work, we introduce a new approach to model group actions in autoencoders. Diverging from prior research in this domain, we propose to learn the group actions on the latent space rather than strictly on the data space. This adaptation enhances the versatility of our model, enabling it to learn a broader range of scenarios prevalent in the real world, where groups can act on latent factors. Our method allows a wide flexibility in the encoder and decoder architectures and does not require group-specific layers. In addition, we show that our model theoretically serves as a superset of methods that learn group actions on the data space. We test our approach on five image datasets with diverse groups acting on them and demonstrate superior performance to recently proposed methods for modeling group actions.

Learning Heuristics for Numeric Planning
In this paper, we explore the possibility of learning heuristics for solving numeric planning tasks. In numeric planning, states may exhibit numeric variables and state transitions are defined by mathematical expressions over these variables. We propose two new learning architectures for numeric planning. Our first approach involves constructing a new graph kernel for graphs with both continuous and categorical attributes, and using it to generate features for numeric planning tasks. This method is quick to compute, transparent and explainable. Our second approach makes use of graph neural networks. Experimental results show that our proposed methods yield competitive coverage performance over several numeric planning benchmarks in comparison to domain-independent planners.

Learning high-dimensional targets by two-parameter models and gradient flow
We explore the theoretical possibility of learning $d$-dimensional targets with $W$-parameter models by gradient flow (GF) when $W<d$. Our main result shows that if the targets are described by a particular $d$-dimensional probability distribution, then there exist models with as few as two parameters that can learn the targets with arbitrarily high success probability. On the other hand, we show that for $W<d$ there is necessarily a large subset of GF-non-learnable targets. In particular, the set of learnable targets is not dense in $\mathbb R^d$, and any subset of $\mathbb R^d$ homeomorphic to the $W$-dimensional sphere contains non-learnable targets. Finally, we observe that the model in our main theorem on almost guaranteed two-parameter learning is constructed using a hierarchical procedure and as a result is not expressible by a single elementary function. We show that this limitation is essential in the sense that most models written in terms of elementary functions cannot achieve the learnability demonstrated in this theorem.

Learning Image Priors Through Patch-Based Diffusion Models for Solving Inverse Problems
Diffusion models can learn strong image priors from underlying data distribution and use them to solve inverse problems,but the training process is computationally expensive and requires lots of data.Such bottlenecks prevent most existing works from being feasible for high-dimensional and high-resolution data such as 3D images.This paper proposes a method to learn an efficient data prior for the entire image by training diffusion models only on patches of images.Specifically, we propose a patch-based position-aware diffusion inverse solver, called PaDIS, where we obtain the score function of the whole image through scores of patches and their positional encoding and utilize this as the prior for solving inverse problems.First of all, we show that this diffusion model achieves an improved memory efficiency and data efficiencywhile still maintaining the  capability to generate entire images via positional encoding.Additionally, the proposed PaDIS model is highly flexible and can be plugged in with different diffusion inverse solvers (DIS).We demonstrate that the proposed PaDIS approach enables solving various inverse problems in both natural and medical image domains, including CT reconstruction, deblurring, and superresolution, given only patch-based priors.Notably, PaDIS outperforms previous DIS methods trained on entire image priors in the case of limited training data, demonstrating the data efficiency of our proposed approach by learning patch-based prior.

Learning in Markov Games with Adaptive Adversaries: Policy Regret, Fundamental Barriers, and Efficient Algorithms
We study learning in a dynamically evolving environment modeled as a  Markov game between a learner and a strategic opponent that can adapt to the learner's strategies. While most existing works in Markov games focus on external regret as the  learning objective, external regret becomes inadequate when the adversaries are adaptive. In this work, we focus on \emph{policy regret} -- a counterfactual notion that aims to compete with the return that would have been attained if the learner had followed the best fixed sequence of policy, in hindsight. We show that if the opponent has unbounded memory or if it is non-stationary, then sample-efficient learning is not possible. For memory-bounded and stationary, we show that learning is still statistically hard if the set of feasible strategies for the learner is exponentially large. To guarantee learnability, we introduce a new notion of \emph{consistent} adaptive adversaries, wherein, the adversary responds similarly to similar strategies of the learner. We provide algorithms that achieve $\sqrt{T}$ policy regret against memory-bounded, stationary, and consistent adversaries.

Learning Linear Causal Representations from General Environments: Identifiability and Intrinsic Ambiguity
We study causal representation learning, the task of recovering high-level latent variables and their causal relationships in the form of a causal graph from low-level observed data (such as text and images), assuming access to observations generated from multiple environments. Prior results on the identifiability of causal representations typically assume access to single-node interventions which is rather unrealistic in practice, since the latent variables are unknown in the first place. In this work, we consider the task of learning causal representation learning with data collected from general environments. We show that even when the causal model and the mixing function are both linear, there exists a surrounded-node ambiguity (SNA) [Varici et al. 2023] which is basically unavoidable in our setting. On the other hand, in the same linear case, we show that identification up to SNA is possible under mild conditions, and propose an algorithm, LiNGCReL which provably achieves such identifiability guarantee. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic data and demonstrate the effectiveness of LiNGCReL in the finite-sample regime.

Learning Low-Rank Feature for Thorax Disease Classification
Deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Visual Transformers (ViT), have achieved stunning success in medical image domain. We study thorax disease classification in this paper. Effective extraction of features for the disease areas is crucial for disease classification on radiographic images. While various neural architectures and training techniques, such as self-supervised learning with contrastive/restorative learning, have been employed for disease classification on radiographic images, there are no principled methods which can effectively reduce the adverse effect of noise and background, or non-disease areas, on the radiographic images for disease classification. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Low-Rank Feature Learning (LRFL) method in this paper, which is universally applicable to the training of all neural networks. The LRFL method is both empirically motivated by a Low Frequency Property (LFP) and theoretically motivated by our sharp generalization bound for neural networks with low-rank features. LFP not only widely exists in deep neural networks for generic machine learning, but also exists on all the thorax medical datasets studied in this paper. In the empirical study, using a neural network such as a ViT or a CNN pre-trained on unlabeled chest X-rays by Masked Autoencoders (MAE), our novel LRFL method is applied on the pre-trained neural network and demonstrates better classification results in terms of both multi-class area under the receiver operating curve (mAUC) and classification accuracy than the current state-of-the-art.

Learning Mixtures of Unknown Causal Interventions
The ability to conduct interventions plays a pivotal role in learning causal relationships among variables, thus facilitating applications across diverse scientific disciplines such as genomics, economics, and machine learning. However, in many instances within these applications, the process of generating interventional data is subject to noise: rather than data being sampled directly from the intended interventional distribution, interventions often yield data sampled from a blend of both intended and unintended interventional distributions.We consider the fundamental challenge of disentangling mixed interventional and observational data within linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs) with Gaussian additive noise without the knowledge of the true causal graph. We demonstrate that conducting interventions, whether do or soft, yields distributions with sufficient diversity and properties conducive to efficiently recovering each component within the mixture. Furthermore, we establish that the sample complexity required to disentangle mixed data inversely correlates with the extent of change induced by an intervention in the equations governing the affected variable values. As a result, the causal graph can be identified up to its interventional Markov Equivalence Class, similar to scenarios where no noise influences the generation of interventional data. We further support our theoretical findings by conducting simulations wherein we perform causal discovery from such mixed data.

Learning Multimodal Behaviors from Scratch with Diffusion Policy Gradient
Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically parameterize the policy as a deep network that outputs either a deterministic action or a stochastic one modeled as a Gaussian distribution, hence restricting learning to a single behavioral mode. Meanwhile, diffusion models emerged as a powerful framework for multimodal learning. However, the use of diffusion policies in online RL is hindered by the intractability of policy likelihood approximation, as well as the greedy objective of RL methods that can easily skew the policy to a single mode. This paper presents Deep Diffusion Policy Gradient (DDiffPG), a novel actor-critic algorithm that learns from scratch multimodal policies parameterized as diffusion models while discovering and maintaining versatile behaviors. DDiffPG explores and discovers multiple modes through off-the-shelf unsupervised clustering combined with novelty-based intrinsic motivation. DDiffPG forms a multimodal training batch and utilizes mode-specific Q-learning to mitigate the inherent greediness of the RL objective, ensuring the improvement of the diffusion policy across all modes. Our approach further allows the policy to be conditioned on mode-specific embeddings to explicitly control the learned modes. Empirical studies validate DDiffPG's capability to master multimodal behaviors in complex, high-dimensional continuous control tasks with sparse rewards, also showcasing proof-of-concept dynamic online replanning when navigating mazes with unseen obstacles.

Learning Neural Contracting Dynamics: Extended Linearization and Global Guarantees
Global stability and robustness guarantees in learned dynamical systems are essential to ensure well-behavedness of the systems in the face of uncertainty. We present Extended Linearized Contracting Dynamics (ELCD), the first neural network-based dynamical system with global contractivity guarantees in arbitrary metrics. The key feature of ELCD is a parametrization of the extended linearization of the nonlinear vector field. In its most basic form, ELCD is guaranteed to be (i) globally exponentially stable, (ii) equilibrium contracting, and (iii) globally contracting with respect to some metric. To allow for contraction with respect to more general metrics in the data space, we train diffeomorphisms between the data space and a latent space and enforce contractivity in the latent space, which ensures global contractivity in the data space. We demonstrate the performance of ELCD on the high dimensional LASA, multi-link pendulum, and Rosenbrock datasets.

Learning Noisy Halfspaces with a Margin: Massart is No Harder than Random
We study the problem of PAC learning $\gamma$-margin halfspaces with Massart noise. We propose a simple  proper learning algorithm, the Perspectron, that has sample complexity $\widetilde{O}((\epsilon\gamma)^{-2})$ and achieves classification error at most $\eta+\epsilon$ where $\eta$ is the Massart noise rate.  Prior works (DGT19, CKMY20)  came with worse sample complexity guarantees (in both $\epsilon$ and $\gamma$) or could only handle random classification noise (DDKWZ23,KITBMV23)--- a much milder noise assumption. We also show that our results extend to the more challenging setting of learning generalized linear models with a known link function under Massart noise, achieving a similar sample complexity to the halfspace case. This significantly improves upon the prior state-of-the-art in this setting due to CKMY20, who introduced this model.

Learning Plaintext-Ciphertext Cryptographic Problems via ANF-based SAT Instance Representation
Cryptographic problems, operating within binary variable spaces, can be routinely transformed into Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems regarding specific cryptographic conditions like plaintext-ciphertext matching. With the fast development of learning for discrete data, this SAT representation also facilitates the utilization of machine-learning approaches with the hope of automatically capturing patterns and strategies inherent in cryptographic structures in a data-driven manner. Existing neural SAT solvers consistently adopt conjunctive normal form (CNF) for instance representation, which in the cryptographic context can lead to scale explosion and a loss of high-level semantics. In particular, extensively used XOR operations in cryptographic problems can incur an exponential number of clauses. In this paper, we propose a graph structure based on Arithmetic Normal Form (ANF) to efficiently handle the XOR operation bottleneck. Additionally, we design an encoding method for AND operations in these ANF-based graphs, demonstrating improved efficiency over alternative general graph forms for SAT. We then propose CryptoANFNet, a graph learning approach that trains a classifier based on a message-passing scheme to predict plaintext-ciphertext satisfiability. Using ANF-based SAT instances, CryptoANFNet demonstrates superior scalability and can naturally capture higher-order operational information. Empirically, CryptoANFNet achieves a 50x speedup over heuristic solvers and outperforms SOTA learning-based SAT solver NeuroSAT, with 96\% vs. 91\% accuracy on small-scale and 72\% vs. 55\% on large-scale datasets from Simon and Speck algorithms. We also introduce a key-solving algorithm that simplifies ANF-based SAT instances from plaintext and ciphertext, enhancing key decryption accuracy from 76.5\% to 82\% and from 72\% to 75\% for datasets generated from Simon and Speck algorithms, respectively.

Learning predictable and robust neural representations by straightening image sequences
Prediction is a fundamental capability of all living organisms, and has been proposed as an objective for learning sensory representations.  Recent work demonstrates that in primate visual systems, prediction is facilitated by neural representations that follow straighter temporal trajectories than their initial photoreceptor encoding, which allows for prediction by linear extrapolation. Inspired by these experimental findings, we develop a self-supervised learning (SSL) objective that explicitly quantifies and promotes straightening. We demonstrate the power of this objective in training deep feedforward neural networks on smoothly-rendered synthetic image sequences that mimic commonly-occurring properties of natural videos. The learned model contains neural embeddings that are predictive, but also factorize the geometric, photometric, and semantic attributes of objects. The representations also prove more robust to noise and adversarial attacks compared to previous SSL methods that optimize for invariance to random augmentations. Moreover, these beneficial properties can be transferred to other training procedures by using the straightening objective as a regularizer, suggesting a broader utility for straightening as a principle for robust unsupervised learning.

Learning Representations for Hierarchies with Minimal Support
When training node embedding models to represent large directed graphs (digraphs), it is impossible to observe all entries of the adjacency matrix during training. As a consequence most methods employ sampling. For very large digraphs, however, this means many (most) entries may be unobserved during training. In general, observing every entry would be necessary to uniquely identify a graph, however if we know the graph has a certain property some entries can be omitted - for example, only half the entries would be required for a symmetric graph. In this work, we develop a novel framework to identify a subset of entries required to uniquely distinguish a graph among all transitively-closed DAGs. We give an explicit algorithm to compute the provably minimal set of entries, and demonstrate empirically that one can train node embedding models with greater efficiency and performance, provided the energy function has an appropriate inductive bias. We achieve robust performance on synthetic hierarchies and a larger real-world taxonomy, observing improved convergence rates in a resource-constrained setting while reducing the set of training examples by as much as 99%.

Learning Structure-Aware Representations of Dependent Types
Agda is a dependently-typed programming language and a proof assistant, pivotal in proof formalization and programming language theory. This paper extends the Agda ecosystem into machine learning territory, and, vice versa, makes Agda-related resources available to machine learning practitioners. We introduce and release a novel dataset of Agda program-proofs that is elaborate and extensive enough to support various machine learning applications -- the first of its kind. Leveraging the dataset's ultra-high resolution, detailing proof states at the subtype level, we propose a novel neural architecture targeted at faithfully representing dependently-typed programs on the basis of structural rather than nominal principles. We instantiate and evaluate our architecture in a premise selection setup, where it achieves strong initial results.

Learning Superconductivity from Ordered and Disordered Material Structures
Superconductivity is a fascinating phenomenon observed in certain materials under certain conditions. However, some critical aspects of it, such as the relationship between superconductivity and materials' chemical/structural features, still need to be understood. Recent successes of data-driven approaches in material science strongly inspire researchers to study this relationship with them, but a corresponding dataset is still lacking. Hence, we present a new dataset for data-driven approaches, namely SuperCon3D, containing both 3D crystal structures and experimental superconducting transition temperature (Tc) for the first time. Based on SuperCon3D, we propose two deep learning methods for designing high Tc superconductors. The first is SODNet, a novel equivariant graph attention model for screening known structures, which differs from existing models in incorporating both ordered and disordered geometric content. The second is a diffusion generative model DiffCSP-SC for creating new structures, which enables high Tc-targeted generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both our proposed dataset and models are advantageous for designing new high Tc superconducting candidates.

Learning symmetries via weight-sharing with doubly stochastic tensors
Group equivariance has emerged as a valuable inductive bias in deep learning, enhancing generalization, data efficiency, and robustness. Classically, group equivariant methods require the groups of interest to be known beforehand, which may not be realistic for real-world data. Additionally, baking in fixed group equivariance may impose overly restrictive constraints on model architecture. This highlights the need for methods that can dynamically discover and apply symmetries as soft constraints. For neural network architectures, equivariance is commonly achieved through group transformations of a canonical weight tensor, resulting in weight sharing over a given group $G$. In this work, we propose to \textit{learn} such a weight-sharing scheme by defining a collection of learnable doubly stochastic matrices that act as soft permutation matrices on canonical weight tensors, which can take regular group representations as a special case. This yields learnable kernel transformations that are jointly optimized with downstream tasks. We show that when the dataset exhibits strong symmetries, the permutation matrices will converge to regular group representations and our weight-sharing networks effectively become regular group convolutions. We also show that our proposed method learns partial symmetries.

Learning the Expected Core of Strictly Convex Stochastic Cooperative Games
Reward allocation, also known as the credit assignment problem, has been an important topic in economics, engineering, and machine learning. An important concept in reward allocation is the core, which is the set of stable allocations where no agent has the motivation to deviate from the grand coalition. In previous works, computing the core requires either knowledge of the reward function in deterministic games or the reward distribution in stochastic games. However, this is unrealistic, as the reward function or distribution is often only partially known and may be subject to uncertainty. In this paper, we consider the core learning problem in stochastic cooperative games, where the reward distribution is unknown. Our goal is to learn the expected core, that is, the set of allocations that are stable in expectation, given an oracle that returns a stochastic reward for an enquired coalition each round. Within the class of strictly convex games, we present an algorithm named \texttt{Common-Points-Picking} that returns a point in the expected core given a polynomial number of samples, with high probability. To analyse the algorithm, we develop a new extension of the separation hyperplane theorem for multiple convex sets.t.

Learning the Infinitesimal Generator of Stochastic Diffusion Processes
We address data-driven learning of the infinitesimal generator of stochastic diffusion processes, essential for understanding numerical simulations of natural and physical systems. The unbounded nature of the generator poses significant challenges, rendering conventional analysis techniques for Hilbert-Schmidt operators ineffective. To overcome this, we introduce a novel framework based on the energy functional for these stochastic processes. Our approach integrates physical priors through an energy-based risk metric in both full and partial knowledge settings. We evaluate the statistical performance of a reduced-rank estimator in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) in the partial knowledge setting. Notably, our approach provides learning bounds independent of the state space dimension and ensures non-spurious spectral estimation. Additionally, we elucidate how the distortion between the intrinsic energy-induced metric of the stochastic diffusion and the RKHS metric used for generator estimation impacts the spectral learning bounds.

Learning the Latent Causal Structure for Modeling Label Noise
In learning with noisy labels, the noise transition matrix reveals how an instance relates from its clean label to its noisy label. Accurately estimating an instance's noise transition matrix is crucial for inferring its clean label. However, when only a noisy dataset is available, noise transition matrices can be estimated only for some "special" instances. To leverage these estimated transition matrices to help estimate transition matrices of other instances, it is essential to explore relations between the matrices of these "special" instances and those of the others.Existing studies usually build the relation by explicitly defining the similarity between the estimated noise transition matrices of "special" instances and those of other instances. However, these similarity-based assumptions are hard to validate and may not be aligned with real-world data. If these assumptions fail, noise transition matrices and clean labels cannot be accurately estimated.In this paper, we found that by learning the latent causal structure governing the generative process of noisy data, we can estimate noise transition matrices directly, eliminating the need for similarity-based assumptions. To achieve this, unlike previous generative label-noise learning methods, we consider causal influences between latent causal variables and model them with a learnable graphical model. Utilizing only noisy data, our method can effectively learn the latent causal structure. Experimental results on various label-noise datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in estimating noise transition matrices, which leads to the improvement of classification accuracy.

Learning the Optimal Policy for Balancing Multiple Short-Term and Long-Term Rewards
Learning the optimal policy to balance multiple short-term and long-term rewards has extensive applications across various domains. Yet, there is a noticeable scarcity of research addressing policy learning strategies in this context. In this paper, we aim to learn the optimal policy capable of effectively balancing multiple short-term and long-term rewards, especially in scenarios where the long-term outcomes are often missing due to data collection challenges over extended periods. Towards this goal, the conventional linear weighting method, which aggregates multiple rewards into a single surrogate reward through weighted summation, can only achieve sub-optimal policies when multiple rewards are related. Motivated by this, we propose a novel decomposition-based policy learning (DPPL) method that converts the whole problem into subproblems. The DPPL method is capable of obtaining optimal policies even when multiple rewards are interrelated. Nevertheless, the DPPL method requires a set of preference vectors specified in advance, posing challenges in practical applications where selecting suitable preferences is non-trivial. To mitigate this, we further theoretically transform the optimization problem in DPPL into an $\varepsilon$-constraint problem, where $\varepsilon$ represents the minimum acceptable levels of other rewards while maximizing one reward. This transformation provides intuitive into the selection of preference vectors. Extensive experiments are conducted on the proposed method and the results validate the effectiveness of the method.

Learning to Assist Humans without Inferring Rewards
Assistive agents should make humans' lives easier. Classically, such assistance is studied through the lens of inverse reinforcement learning, where an assistive agent (e.g., a chatbot, a robot) infers a human's intention and then selects actions to help the human reach that goal. This approach requires inferring intentions, which can be difficult in high-dimensional settings. We build upon prior work that studies assistance through the lens of empowerment: an assistive agent aims to maximize the influence of the human's actions such that they exert a greater control over the environmental outcomes and can solve tasks in fewer steps. We lift the major limitation of prior work in this area—scalability to high-dimensional settings—with contrastive successor representations. We formally prove that these representations estimate a similar notion of empowerment to that studied by prior work and provide a ready-made mechanism for optimizing it. Empirically, our proposed method outperforms prior methods on synthetic benchmarks, and scales to Overcooked, a cooperative game setting. Theoretically, our work connects ideas from information theory, neuroscience, and reinforcement learning, and charts a path for representations to play a critical role in solving assistive problems. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/esr-7E94.

Learning-to-Cache: Accelerating Diffusion Transformer via Layer Caching
Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated unprecedented generative capabilities for various tasks. The encouraging results, however, come with the cost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a transformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an interesting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large proportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a caching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model parameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68% of the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than 0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named Learning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for diffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of layers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore redundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the fundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential search space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we propose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet timestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static computation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms samplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at the same inference speed.

Learning to compute Gröbner bases
Solving a polynomial system, or computing an associated Gröbner basis, has been a fundamental task in computational algebra. However, it is also known for its notorious doubly exponential time complexity in the number of variables in the worst case. This paper is the first to address the learning of Gröbner basis computation with Transformers. The training requires many pairs of a polynomial system and the associated Gröbner basis, raising two novel algebraic problems: random generation of Gröbner bases and transforming them into non-Gröbner ones, termed as backward Gröbner problem. We resolve these problems with 0-dimensional radical ideals, the ideals appearing in various applications. Further, we propose a hybrid input embedding to handle coefficient tokens with continuity bias and avoid the growth of the vocabulary set. The experiments show that our dataset generation method is at least three orders of magnitude faster than a naive approach, overcoming a crucial challenge in learning to compute Gröbner bases, and Gröbner computation is learnable in a particular class.

Learning to Embed Distributions via Maximum Kernel Entropy
Empirical data can often be considered as samples from a set of probability distributions. Kernel methods have emerged as a natural approach for learning to classify these distributions. Although numerous kernels between distributions have been proposed, applying kernel methods to distribution regression tasks remains challenging, primarily because selecting a suitable kernel is not straightforward. Surprisingly, the question of learning a data-dependent distribution kernel has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a novel objective for the unsupervised learning of data-dependent distribution kernel, based on the principle of entropy maximization in the space of probability measure embeddings. We examine the theoretical properties of the latent embedding space induced by our objective, demonstrating that its geometric structure is well-suited for solving downstream discriminative tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the learned kernel across different modalities.

Learning to grok: Emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in modular arithmetic tasks
Large language models can solve tasks that were not present in the training set. This capability is believed to be due to in-context learning and skill composition. In this work, we study the emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in a collection of modular arithmetic tasks. Specifically, we consider a finite collection of linear modular functions $z = a  x + b  y \text{ mod } p$ labeled by the vector $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}_p^2$. We use some of these tasks for pre-training and the rest for out-of-distribution testing. We empirically show that a GPT-style transformer exhibits a transition from in-distribution to out-of-distribution generalization as the number of pre-training tasks increases. We find that the smallest model capable of out-of-distribution generalization requires two transformer blocks, while for deeper models, the out-of-distribution generalization phase is *transient*, necessitating early stopping. Finally, we perform an interpretability study of the pre-trained models, revealing the highly structured representations in both phases; and discuss the learnt algorithm.

Learning to Price Homogeneous Data
We study a data pricing problem, where a seller has access to $N$ homogeneous data points (e.g. drawn i.i.d. from some distribution).There are $N$ types of buyers in the market, where buyers of the same type $i$ have the same valuation curve $v_i:[N]\rightarrow [0,1]$, where $v_i(n)$ is the value for having $n$ data points.*A priori*, the seller is unaware of thedistribution of buyers, but can repeat the market for $T$ rounds so as to learn the revenue-optimal pricing curve $p:[N] \rightarrow [0, 1]$.To solve this online learning problem,we first develop novel discretization schemes to approximate any pricing curve.When compared to prior work,the size of our discretization schemes scales gracefully with the approximation parameter, which translates to better regret in online learning.Under assumptions like smoothness and diminishing returns which are satisfied by data, the discretization size can be reduced further.We then turn to the online learning problem, both in the stochastic and adversarial settings.On each round, the seller chooses an *anonymous* pricing curve $p_t$.A new buyer appears and may choose to purchase some amount of data.She then reveals her type *only if* she makes a purchase.Our online algorithms build on classical algorithms such as UCB and FTPL, but require novel ideas to account for the asymmetric nature of this feedback and to deal with the vastness of the space of pricing curves.Using the improved discretization schemes previously developed, we are able to achieve $\widetilde{O}(N\sqrt{T})$ regret in the stochastic setting and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret in the adversarial setting.

Learning to Reason Iteratively and Parallelly for Complex Visual Reasoning Scenarios
Complex visual reasoning and question answering (VQA) is a challenging task that requires compositional multi-step processing and higher-level reasoning capabilities beyond the immediate recognition and localization of objects and events. Here, we introduce a fully neural Iterative and Parallel Reasoning Mechanism (IPRM) that combines two distinct forms of computation -- iterative and parallel -- to better address complex VQA scenarios.  Specifically, IPRM's "iterative" computation facilitates compositional step-by-step reasoning for scenarios wherein individual operations need to be computed, stored, and recalled dynamically (e.g. when computing the query “determine the color of pen to the left of the child in red t-shirt sitting at the white table”). Meanwhile, its  "parallel'' computation allows for the simultaneous exploration of different reasoning paths and benefits more robust and efficient execution of  operations that are mutually independent (e.g. when counting individual colors for the query: "determine the maximum occurring color amongst all t-shirts'"). We design IPRM as a lightweight and fully-differentiable neural module that can be conveniently applied to both transformer and non-transformer vision-language backbones. It notably outperforms prior task-specific methods and transformer-based attention modules across various image and video VQA benchmarks testing distinct complex reasoning capabilities such as compositional spatiotemporal reasoning (AGQA), situational reasoning (STAR), multi-hop reasoning generalization (CLEVR-Humans) and causal event linking (CLEVRER-Humans). Further, IPRM's internal computations can be visualized across reasoning steps, aiding interpretability and diagnosis of its errors.

Learning to Solve Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization in a Classification Way
The quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) is a well-known NP-hard problem that takes an $n\times n$ matrix $Q$ as input and decides an $n$-dimensional 0-1 vector $x$, to optimize a quadratic function. Existing learning-based models that always formulate the solution process as sequential decisions suffer from high computational overload. To overcome this issue, we propose a neural solver called the Value Classification Model (VCM) that formulates the solution process from a classification perspective. It applies a Depth Value Network (DVN) based on graph convolution that exploits the symmetry property in $Q$ to auto-grasp value features. These features are then fed into a Value Classification Network (VCN) which directly generates classification solutions. Trained by a highly efficient model-tailored Greedy-guided Self Trainer (GST) which does not require any priori optimal labels, VCM significantly outperforms competitors in both computational efficiency and solution quality with a remarkable generalization ability. It can achieve near-optimal solutions in milliseconds with an average optimality gap of just 0.362\% on benchmarks with up to 2500 variables. Notably, a VCM trained at a specific DVN depth can steadily find better solutions by simply extending the testing depth, which narrows the gap to 0.034\% on benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first learning-based model to reach such a performance.

Learning to Understand: Identifying Interactions via the Möbius Transform
One of the key challenges in machine learning is to find interpretable representations of learned functions. The Möbius transform is essential for this purpose, as its coefficients correspond to unique *importance scores* for *sets of input variables*.This transform is closely related to widely used game-theoretic notions of importance like the *Shapley* and *Bhanzaf value*, but it also captures crucial higher-order interactions.Although computing the Möbius Transform of a function with $n$ inputs involves $2^n$ coefficients, it becomes tractable when the function is *sparse* and of *low-degree* as we show is the case for many real-world functions. Under these conditions, the complexity of the transform computation is significantly reduced.When there are $K$ non-zero coefficients, our algorithm recovers the Möbius transform in $O(Kn)$ samples and $O(Kn^2)$ time asymptotically under certain assumptions, the first non-adaptive algorithm to do so. We also uncover a surprising connection between group testing and the Möbius transform. For functions where all interactions involve at most $t$ inputs, we use group testing results to compute the Möbius transform with $O(Kt\log n)$ sample complexity and $O(K\mathrm{poly}(n))$ time. A robust version of this algorithm withstands noise and maintains this complexity. This marks the first $n$ sub-linear query complexity, noise-tolerant algorithm for the M\"{o}bius transform.While our algorithms are conceptualized in an idealized setting, they indicate that the Möbius transform is a potent tool for interpreting deep learning models.

Learning Transferable Features for Implicit Neural Representations
Implicit neural representations (INRs) have demonstrated success in a variety of applications, including inverse problems and neural rendering. An INR is typically trained to capture one signal of interest, resulting in learned neural features that are highly attuned to that signal. Assumed to be less generalizable, we explore the aspect of transferability of such learned neural features for fitting similar signals. We introduce a new INR training framework, STRAINER that learns transferable features for fitting INRs to new signals from a given distribution, faster and with better reconstruction quality. Owing to the sequential layer-wise affine operations in an INR, we propose to learn transferable representations by sharing initial encoder layers across multiple INRs with independent decoder layers. At test time, the learned encoder representations are transferred as initialization for an otherwise randomly initialized INR. We find STRAINER to yield extremely powerful initialization for fitting images from the same domain and allow for a ≈ +10dB gain in signal quality early on compared to an untrained INR itself. STRAINER also provides a simple way to encode data-driven priors in INRs. We evaluate STRAINER on multiple in-domain and out-of-domain signal fitting tasks and inverse problems and further provide detailed analysis and discussion on the transferability of STRAINER’s features.

Learning with Fitzpatrick Losses
Fenchel-Young losses are a family of convex loss functions,encompassing the squared, logistic and sparsemax losses, among others.Each Fenchel-Young loss is implicitly associated with a link function, formapping model outputs to predictions. For instance, the logistic loss isassociated with the soft argmax link function. Can we build new loss functionsassociated with the same link function as Fenchel-Young losses?In this paper, we introduce Fitzpatrick losses, a new family of convex lossfunctions based on the Fitzpatrick function. A well-known theoretical tool inmaximal monotone operator theory, the Fitzpatrick function naturally leads to arefined Fenchel-Young inequality, making Fitzpatrick losses tighter thanFenchel-Young losses, while maintaining the same linkfunction for prediction.  As an example, we introduce the Fitzpatrick logistic loss and theFitzpatrick sparsemax loss, counterparts of the logistic and the sparsemaxlosses. This yields twonew tighter losses associated with the soft argmax and the sparse argmax,two of the most ubiquitous output layers used in machine learning. We study indetails the properties of Fitzpatrick losses and in particular, we show thatthey can be seen as Fenchel-Young losses using a modified, target-dependentgenerating function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Fitzpatrick losses forlabel proportion estimation.

Least Squares Regression Can Exhibit Under-Parameterized Double Descent
The relationship between the number of training data points, the number of parameters, and the generalization capabilities has been widely studied. Previous work has shown that double descent can occur in the over-parameterized regime, and believe that the standard bias-variance trade-off holds in the under-parameterized regime. These works provide multiple reasons for the existence of the peak. We postulate that the location of the peak depends on the technical properties of both the spectrum as well as the eigenvectors of the sample covariance. We present two simple examples that provably exhibit double descent in the under-parameterized regime and do not seem to occur for reasons provided in prior work.

Length Optimization in Conformal Prediction
Conditional validity and length efficiency are two crucial aspects of conformal prediction (CP). Achieving conditional validity ensures accurate uncertainty quantification for data subpopulations, while proper length efficiency ensures that the prediction sets remain informative and non-trivial. Despite significant efforts to address each of these issues individually, a principled framework that reconciles these two objectives has been missing the CP literature. In this paper, we develop Conformal Prediction with Length-Optimization (CPL) - a novel framework that constructs prediction sets with (near-) optimal length while ensuring conditional validity under various classes of covariate shifts, including the key cases of marginal and group-conditional coverage. We provide both infinite sample and finite sample guarantees for CPL's conditional validity and length optimality. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of CPL compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse real-world and synthetic datasets in both classification and regression settings.

Leveraging an ECG Beat Diffusion Model for Morphological Reconstruction from Indirect Signals
Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide essential information about the heart's condition and are widely used for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. The morphology of a single heartbeat over the available leads is a primary biosignal for monitoring cardiac conditions. However, analyzing heartbeat morphology can be challenging due to noise and artifacts, missing leads, and a lack of annotated data.Generative models, such as denoising diffusion generative models (DDMs), have proven successful in generating complex data. We introduce $\texttt{BeatDiff}$, a light-weight DDM tailored for the morphology of multiple leads heartbeats.We then show that many important ECG downstream tasks can be formulated as conditional generation methods in a Bayesian inverse problem framework using $\texttt{BeatDiff}$ as priors. We propose $\texttt{EM-BeatDiff}$, an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, to solve this conditional generation tasks without fine-tuning. We illustrate our results with several tasks, such as removal of ECG noise and artifacts (baseline wander, electrode motion), reconstruction of a 12-lead ECG from a single lead (useful for ECG reconstruction of smartwatch experiments), and unsupervised explainable anomaly detection. Numerical experiments show that the combination of $\texttt{BeatDiff}$ and $\texttt{EM-BeatDiff}$ outperforms SOTA methods for the problems considered in this work.

Leveraging Catastrophic Forgetting to Develop Safe Diffusion Models against Malicious Finetuning
Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating images based on textual prompts. To ensure these models generate safe images, numerous methods have been proposed. Early methods attempt to incorporate safety filters into models to mitigate the risk of generating harmful images but such external filters do not inherently detoxify the model and can be easily bypassed. Hence, model unlearning and data cleaning are the most essential methods for maintaining the safety of models, given their impact on model parameters.However, malicious fine-tuning can still make models prone to generating harmful or undesirable images even with these methods.Inspired by the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting, we propose a training policy using contrastive learning to increase the latent space distance between clean and harmful data distribution, thereby protecting models from being fine-tuned to generate harmful images due to forgetting.Specifically, we have two instantiations: transforming the data latent and guiding diffusion noise. Latent transformation refers to the operation of transforming the latent variable distribution of images. Noise guidance is adding different noises to clean and harmful images to induce different changes in the distribution of images. The experimental results demonstrate that both of our instantiations not only maintain superior image generation capabilities before malicious fine-tuning but also effectively prevent DMs from producing harmful images after malicious fine-tuning. Our method can also be combined with other safety methods to further maintain their safety against malicious fine-tuning.

Leveraging Contrastive Learning for Enhanced Node Representations in Tokenized Graph Transformers
While tokenized graph Transformers have demonstrated strong performance in node classification tasks, their reliance on a limited subset of nodes with high similarity scores for constructing token sequences overlooks valuable information from other nodes, hindering their ability to fully harness graph information for learning optimal node representations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph Transformer called GCFormer. Unlike previous approaches, GCFormer develops a hybrid token generator to create two types of token sequences, positive and negative, to capture diverse graph information. And a tailored Transformer-based backbone is adopted to learn meaningful node representations from these generated token sequences. Additionally, GCFormer introduces contrastive learning to extract valuable information from both positive and negative token sequences, enhancing the quality of learned node representations. Extensive experimental results across various datasets, including homophily and heterophily graphs, demonstrate the superiority of GCFormer in node classification, when compared to representative graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph Transformers.

Leveraging partial stragglers within gradient coding
Within distributed learning, workers typically compute gradients on their assigned dataset chunks and send them to the parameter server (PS), which aggregates them to compute either an exact or approximate version of $\nabla L$ (gradient of the loss function $L$). However, in large-scale clusters, many workers are slower than their promised speed or even failure-prone. A gradient coding solution introduces redundancy within the assignment of chunks to the workers and uses coding theoretic ideas to allow the PS to recover $\nabla L$ (exactly or approximately), even in the presence of stragglers. Unfortunately, most existing gradient coding protocols are inefficient from a computation perspective as they coarsely classify workers as operational or failed; the potentially valuable work performed by slow workers (partial stragglers) is ignored. In this work, we present novel gradient coding protocols that judiciously leverage the work performed by partial stragglers. Our protocols are efficient from a computation and communication perspective and numerically stable. For an important class of chunk assignments, we present efficient algorithms for optimizing the relative ordering of chunks within the workers; this ordering affects the overall execution time. For exact gradient reconstruction, our protocol is around $2\times$ faster than the original class of protocols and for approximate gradient reconstruction, the mean-squared-error of our reconstructed gradient is several orders of magnitude better.

Leveraging Tumor Heterogeneity: Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning for Cancer Survival Prediction in Whole Slide Images
Survival prediction is a significant challenge in cancer management. Tumor is a highly intricate ecosystem consisting of malignant cells and other tissues. The intratumor heterogeneity and the interaction across multiple tissue types profoundly impacts the prognosis. However, current methods often neglect the fact that the contribution to prognosis differs with tissue types. In this paper, we propose ProtoSurv, a novel heterogeneous graph model for WSI survival prediction. The learning process of ProtoSurv is not only driven by data but also incorporates pathological domain knowledge, including the awareness of tissue heterogeneity, the emphasis on prior knowledge of prognostic-related tissues, and the depiction of spatial interaction across multiple tissues. We validate ProtoSurv across five different cancer types from TCGA (i.e., BRCA, LGG, LUAD, COAD and PAAD), and demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art methods.

Lever LM: Configuring In-Context Sequence to Lever Large Vision Language Models
As Archimedes famously said, ``Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world'', in this study, we propose to use a tiny Language Model (LM), \eg, a Transformer with 67M parameters, to lever much larger Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with 9B parameters. Specifically, we use this tiny \textbf{Lever-LM} to configure effective in-context demonstration (ICD) sequences to improve the In-Context Learinng (ICL) performance of LVLMs. Previous studies show that diverse ICD configurations like the selection and ordering of the demonstrations heavily affect the ICL performance, highlighting the significance of configuring effective ICD sequences. Motivated by this and by re-considering the the process of configuring ICD sequence, we find this is a mirror process of human sentence composition and further assume that effective ICD configurations may contain internal statistical patterns that can be captured by Lever-LM. Then a dataset with effective ICD sequences is constructed to train Lever-LM. After training, given novel queries, new ICD sequences are configured by the trained Lever-LM to solve vision-language tasks through ICL. Experiments show that these ICD sequences can improve the ICL performance of two LVLMs compared with some strong baselines in Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning, validating that Lever-LM can really capture the statistical patterns for levering LVLMs. The code is available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Lever-LM-604A/}.

Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Encoding Models for Complex 3D Scene Understanding
Complex 3D scene understanding has gained increasing attention, with scene encoding strategy playing a crucial role in its success. However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We assess these models across four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.

LibMOON: A Gradient-based MultiObjective OptimizatioN Library in PyTorch
Multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) are prevalent in machine learning, with applications in multi-task learning, learning under fairness or robustness constraints, etc. Instead of reducing multiple objective functions into a scalar objective, MOPs aim to optimize for the so-called Pareto optimality or Pareto set learning, which involves optimizing more than one objective function simultaneously, over models with millions of parameters. Existing benchmark libraries for MOPs mainly focus on evolutionary algorithms, most of which are zeroth-order methods that do not utilize higher-order information from multiple objectives and cannot scale to large-scale models with millions of parameters. In light of the above gap, this paper introduces \algoname, the first multiobjective optimization library that supports state-of-the-art gradient-based methods, provides a fair benchmark, and is open-sourced for the community.\footnote{\algoname~is available at \url{https://github.com/xzhang2523/libmoon} and can be installed via ``\texttt{pip install libmoon}''.

Light Unbalanced Optimal Transport
While the continuous Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) field has been actively developing in recent years, it became evident that the classic EOT problem is prone to different issues like the sensitivity to outliers and imbalance of classes in the source and target measures. This fact inspired the development of solvers that deal with the *unbalanced* EOT (UEOT) problem $-$ the generalization of EOT allowing for mitigating the mentioned issues by relaxing the marginal constraints. Surprisingly, it turns out that the existing solvers are either based on heuristic principles or heavy-weighted with complex optimization objectives involving several neural networks. We address this challenge and propose a novel theoretically-justified, lightweight, unbalanced EOT solver. Our advancement consists of developing a novel view on the optimization of the UEOT problem yielding tractable and a non-minimax optimization objective. We show that combined with a light parametrization recently proposed in the field our objective leads to a fast, simple, and effective solver which allows solving the continuous UEOT problem in minutes on CPU. We prove that our solver provides a universal approximation of UEOT solutions and obtain its generalization bounds. We give illustrative examples of the solver's performance.

Lightweight Frequency Masker for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation
Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to first pre-train the model on a large-scale source-domain dataset, and then transfer the model to data-scarce target-domain datasets for pixel-level segmentation. The significant domain gap between the source and target datasets leads to a sharp decline in the performance of existing few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods in cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we discover an intriguing phenomenon: simply filtering different frequency components for target domains can lead to a significant performance improvement, sometimes even as high as 14%. Then, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation, and find such improvements stem from the reduced inter-channel correlation in feature maps, which benefits CD-FSS with enhanced robustness against domain gaps and larger activated regions for segmentation. Based on this, we propose a lightweight frequency masker, which further reduces channel correlations by an amplitude-phase-masker (APM) module and an Adaptive Channel Phase Attention (ACPA) module. Notably, APM introduces only 0.01% additional parameters but improves the average performance by over 10%, and ACPA imports only 2.5% parameters but further improves the performance by over 1.5%, which significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art CD-FSS methods.

Likelihood-based differentiable structure learning
Existing approaches to differentiable structure learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) rely on strong identifiability assumptions in order to guarantee that global minimizers of the acyclicity-constrained optimization problem identifies the true DAG. Moreover, it has been observed empirically that the optimizer may exploit undesirable artifacts in the loss function. We explain and remedy these issues by studying the behavior of differentiable acyclicity-constrained programs under general likelihoods with multiple global minimizers. By carefully regularizing the likelihood, it is possible to identify the sparsest model in the Markov equivalence class, even in the absence of an identifiable parametrization. We first study the Gaussian case in detail, showing how proper regularization of the likelihood defines a score that identifies the sparsest model. Assuming faithfulness, it also recovers the Markov equivalence class. These results are then generalized to general models and likelihoods, where the same claims hold. These theoretical results are validated empirically, showing how this can be done using standard gradient-based optimizers, thus paving the way for differentiable structure learning under general models and losses.

Limits of Transformer Language Models on Learning to Compose Algorithms
We analyze the capabilities of Transformer language models in learning compositional discrete tasks. To this end, we evaluate training LLaMA models and prompting GPT-4 and Gemini on four tasks demanding to learn a composition of several discrete sub-tasks.On both training LLaMA models from scratch and prompting on GPT-4 and Gemini, we measure how well these models can reuse primitives observable in the sub-tasks to learn the composition task. Our results indicate that compositional learning in state-of-the-art Transformer language models is highly sample inefficient: LLaMA requires more data samples than relearning all sub-tasks from scratch to learn the compositional task; in-context prompting with few samples is unreliable and fails at executing the sub-tasks or correcting the errors in multi-round code generation.Further, by leveraging complexity theory, we support these findings with a theoretical analysis focused on the sample inefficiency of gradient descent in memorizing feedforward models.

Linear Causal Representation Learning from Unknown Multi-node Interventions
Despite the multifaceted recent advances in interventional causal representation learning (CRL), they primarily focus on the stylized assumption of single-node interventions. This assumption is not valid in a wide range of applications, and generally, the subset of nodes intervened in an interventional environment is *fully unknown*. This paper focuses on interventional CRL under unknown multi-node (UMN) intervention environments and establishes the first identifiability results for *general* latent causal models (parametric or nonparametric) under stochastic interventions (soft or hard) and linear transformation from the latent to observed space. Specifically, it is established that given sufficiently diverse interventional environments, (i) identifiability *up to ancestors* is possible using only *soft* interventions, and (ii) *perfect* identifiability is possible using *hard* interventions. Remarkably, these guarantees match the best-known results for more restrictive single-node interventions. Furthermore, CRL algorithms are also provided that achieve the identifiability guarantees. A central step in designing these algorithms is establishing the relationships between UMN interventional CRL and score functions associated with the statistical models of different interventional environments. Establishing these relationships also serves as constructive proof of the identifiability guarantees.

Linearly Decomposing and Recomposing Vision Transformers for Diverse-Scale Models
Vision Transformers (ViTs) are widely used in a variety of applications, while they usually have a fixed architecture that may not match the varying computational resources of different deployment environments. Thus it is necessary to adapt ViT architectures to the devices with diverse computation overheads to achieve accuracy-efficient trade-offs. To achieve this, inspired by polynomial decomposition in calculus that a function can be approximated by linearly combining several basic components, we propose to linearly decompose the ViT model into a set of components during element-wise training. These components can then be recomposed into differently scaled, pre-initialized models to satisfy different computational resource constraints. Such decomposition-recomposition strategy provides an economical and flexible approach to generating diverse scales of ViT models for different deployment scenarios. Compared to model compression or training from scratch, which require to repeatedly train on large datasets for diverse-scale models, such strategy reduces computational costs since it only requires to train on large datasets once. Extensive experiments are used to validate the effectiveness of our method: ViTs can be decomposed and the decomposed components can be recomposed into diverse-scale ViTs, which can achieve comparable or better performance compared to traditional model compression and pre-training methods. The code for our experiments is available in the supplemental material.

Linear Regression using Heterogeneous Data Batches
In many learning applications, data are collected from multiple sources, each providing a \emph{batch} of samples that by itself is insufficient to learn its input-output relationship. A common approach assumes that the sources fall in one of several unknown subgroups, each with an unknown input distribution and input-output relationship. We consider one of this setup's most fundamental and important manifestations where the output is a noisy linear combination of the inputs, and there are $k$ subgroups, each with its own regression vector. Prior work [KSS$^+$20] showed that with abundant small-batches, the regression vectors can be learned with only few, $\tilde\Omega( k^{3/2})$, batches of medium-size with $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt k)$ samples each. However, the paper requires that the input distribution for all $k$ subgroups be isotropic Gaussian, and states that removing this assumption is an ``interesting and challenging problem". We propose a novel gradient-based algorithm that improves on the existing results in several ways. It extends the applicability of the algorithm by: (1) allowing the subgroups' underlying input distributions to be different, unknown, and heavy-tailed; (2) recovering all subgroups followed by a significant proportion of batches even for infinite $k$; (3) removing the separation requirement between the regression vectors; (4) reducing the number of batches and allowing smaller batch sizes.

Linear Time Approximation Algorithm for Column Subset Selection with Local Search
The Column Subset Selection (CSS) problem has been widely studied in dimensionality reduction and feature selection, where the goal is to output a submatrix $S$ consisting of k columns from a n×d input matrix A that minimizes the residual error ‖A-SS^\dagger A‖_F^2 and S^\dagger is the Moore-Penrose inverse matrix of $S$. Many previous approximation algorithms have non-linear running times in n and d, while the existing linear time algorithm has a relatively larger approximation ratio. Additionally, the local search algorithms in existing results for solving the CSS problem are heuristic. To achieve linear running time while maintaining better approximation using a local search strategy, we propose a local search-based approximation algorithm for the CSS problem with exactly k columns selected. A key challenge in achieving linear running time with the local search strategy is how to avoid exhaustive enumerations of candidate columns for constructing swap pairs in each local search step. To address this issue, we propose a two-step mixed sampling method which can reduce the number of enumerations for swap pair construction from O(dk) to k in linear time. Although two-step mixed sampling method reduces the search space of local search strategy, bounding the residual error after swaps is a non-trivial task. To estimate the changes in residual error after swaps, we propose a matched swap pair construction method to bound the approximation loss, guaranteeing a constant probability of reduction in loss with each local search step. These techniques enable us to obtain the local search algorithm for the CSS problem with theoretical guarantees, where a 110(k+1)-approximate solution can be obtained in linear running time O(ndk^3\log k) in expectation. Empirical experiments show that our proposed algorithm achieves better quality and time compared to previous algorithms on both small and large datasets. Moreover, it is at least 10 times faster than state-of-the-art algorithms across all large-scale datasets.

Linear Transformers are Versatile In-Context Learners
Recent research has demonstrated that transformers, particularly linear attention models, implicitly execute gradient-descent-like algorithms on data provided in-context during their forward inference step. However, their capability in handling more complex problems remains unexplored. In this paper, we prove that each layer of a linear transformer maintains a weight vector for an implicit linear regression problem and can be interpreted as performing a variant of preconditioned gradient descent. We also investigate the use of linear transformers in a challenging scenario where the training data is corrupted with different levels of noise. Remarkably, we demonstrate that for this problem linear transformers discover an intricate and highly effective optimization algorithm, surpassing or matching in performance many reasonable baselines. We analyze this algorithm and show that it is a novel approach incorporating momentum and adaptive rescaling based on noise levels. Our findings show that even linear transformers possess the surprising ability to discover sophisticated optimization strategies.

Linear Uncertainty Quantification of Graphical Model Inference
Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is vital for decision makers as it offers insights into the potential reliability of data and model, enabling more informed and risk-aware decision-making. Graphical models, known for their capability to represent data with complex dependencies, are widely utilized across various domains. Existing sampling-based UQ methods are unbiased  but cannot guarantee convergence and is time-consuming on large-scale graphs. There are fast UQ methods for graphical models with closed-form solutions and convergence guarantee but with biased uncertainty underestimation.We propose *LinUProp*, a UQ method that utilizes a novel linear propagation of uncertainty to model uncertainty among related nodes additively instead of multiplicatively, to offer linear scalability, guaranteed convergence, and unbiased closed-form solutions.Theoretically, we decompose the expected prediction error of the graphical model and prove that the uncertainty computed by *LinUProp* is the *generalized variance component* of the decomposition. Experimentally, we demonstrated that *LinUProp* is consistent with the sampling-based method but with linear scalability and fast convergence.Moreover, *LinUProp* outperforms competitors in uncertainty-based active learning on four real-world graph datasets, achieving higher accuracy with a lower labeling budget.

Linguistic Collapse: Neural Collapse in (Large) Language Models
Neural collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) is a phenomenon observed in classification tasks where top-layer representations collapse into their class means, which become equinorm, equiangular and aligned with the classifiers.These behaviors -- associated with generalization and robustness -- would manifest under specific conditions: models are trained towards zero loss, with noise-free labels belonging to balanced classes, which do not outnumber the model's hidden dimension.Recent studies have explored $\mathcal{NC}$ in the absence of one or more of these conditions to extend and capitalize on the associated benefits of ideal geometries.Language modeling presents a curious frontier, as \textit{training by token prediction} constitutes a classification task where none of the conditions exist: the vocabulary is imbalanced and exceeds the embedding dimension; different tokens might correspond to similar contextual embeddings; and large language models (LLMs) in particular are typically only trained for a few epochs.This paper empirically investigates the impact of scaling the architectures and training of causal language models (CLMs) on their progression towards $\mathcal{NC}$.We find that $\mathcal{NC}$ properties that develop with scaling are linked to generalization.Moreover, there is evidence of some relationship between $\mathcal{NC}$ and generalization independent of scale.Our work therefore underscores the generality of $\mathcal{NC}$ as it extends to the novel and more challenging setting of language modeling.Downstream, we seek to inspire further research on the phenomenon in order to deepen our understanding of LLMs -- and neural networks at large -- and improve existing architectures based on $\mathcal{NC}$-related properties.

LiteVAE: Lightweight and Efficient Variational Autoencoders for Latent Diffusion Models
Advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs) have revolutionized high-resolution image generation, but the design space of the autoencoder that is central to these systems remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LiteVAE, a family of autoencoders for LDMs that leverage the 2D discrete wavelet transform to enhance scalability and computational efficiency over standard variational autoencoders (VAEs) with no sacrifice in output quality.   We also investigate the training methodologies and the decoder architecture of LiteVAE and propose several enhancements that improve the training dynamics and reconstruction quality. Our base LiteVAE model matches the quality of the established VAEs in current LDMs with a six-fold reduction in encoder parameters, leading to faster training and lower GPU memory requirements, while our larger model outperforms VAEs of comparable complexity across all evaluated metrics (rFID, LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM).

LiveScene: Language Embedding Interactive Radiance Fields for Physical Scene Control and Rendering
This paper aims to advance the progress of physical world interactive scene reconstruction by extending the interactive object reconstruction from single object level to complex scene level. To this end, we first construct one simulated and one real scene-level physical interaction dataset containing 28 scenes with multiple interactive objects per scene. Furthermore, to accurately model the interactive motions of multiple objects in complex scenes, we propose \textbf{\ours}, the first scene-level language-embedded interactive neural radiance field that efficiently reconstructs and controls multiple interactive objects in complex scenes. \ours introduces an efficient factorization that decomposes the interactive scene into multiple local deformable fields to separately reconstruct individual interactive objects, achieving the first accurate and independent control on multiple interactive objects in a complex scene. Moreover, we introduce an interaction-aware language embedding method that generates varying language embeddings to localize individual interactive objects under different interactive states, enabling arbitrary control of interactive objects using natural language. Finally, we evaluate \ours on the constructed datasets \textbf{\simdata} and \textbf{\realdata} with various simulated and real-world complex scenes. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves SOTA novel view synthesis and language grounding performance, surpassing existing methods by +9.89, +1.30, and +1.99 in PSNR on CoNeRF Synthetic, \simdata \#chanllenging, and \realdata \#chanllenging datasets, and +65.12 of mIOU on \simdata, respectively. The code and dataset will be released upon the paper publication.

LLM-based Skill Diffusion for Zero-shot Policy Adaptation
Recent advances in data-driven imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning have highlighted the use of expert data for skill acquisition and the development of hierarchical policies based on these skills. However, these approaches have not significantly advanced in adapting these skills to unseen contexts, which may involve changing environmental conditions or different user requirements. In this paper, we present a novel LLM-based policy adaptation framework LDuS which leverages an LLM to guide the generation process of a skill diffusion model upon contexts specified in language, facilitating zero-shot skill-based policy adaptation to different contexts. To implement the skill diffusion model, we adapt the loss-guided diffusion with a sequential in-painting technique, where target trajectories are conditioned by masking them with past state-action sequences, thereby enabling the robust and controlled generation of skill trajectories in test-time. To have a loss function for a given context, we employ the LLM-based code generation with iterative refinement, by which the code and controlled trajectory are validated to align with the context in a closed-loop manner. Through experiments, we demonstrate the zero-shot adaptability of LDuS to various context types including different specification levels, multi-modality, and varied temporal conditions for several robotic manipulation tasks, outperforming other language-conditioned imitation and planning methods.

LM-HT SNN: Enhancing the Performance of SNN to ANN Counterpart through Learnable Multi-hierarchical Threshold Model
Compared to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has garnered widespread academic interest for its intrinsic ability to transmit information in a more energy-efficient manner. However, despite previous efforts to optimize the learning algorithm of SNNs through various methods, SNNs still lag behind ANNs in terms of performance. The recently proposed multi-threshold model provides more possibilities for further enhancing the learning capability of SNNs. In this paper, we rigorously analyze the relationship among the multi-threshold model, vanilla spiking model and quantized ANNs from a mathematical perspective, then propose a novel LM-HT model, which is an equidistant multi-threshold model that can dynamically regulate the global input current and membrane potential leakage on the time dimension. The LM-HT model can also be transformed into a vanilla single threshold model through reparameterization, thereby achieving more flexible hardware deployment. In addition, we note that the LM-HT model can seamlessly integrate with ANN-SNN Conversion framework under special initialization. This novel hybrid learning framework can effectively improve the relatively poor performance of converted SNNs under low time latency. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that our model can outperform previous state-of-the-art works on various types of datasets, which promote SNNs to achieve a brand-new level of performance comparable to quantized ANNs.

Local and Adaptive Mirror Descents in Extensive-Form Games
We study how to learn $\epsilon$-optimal strategies in zero-sum imperfect information games (IIG) with *trajectory feedback*. In this setting, players update their policies sequentially, based on their observations over a fixed number of episodes denoted by $T$. Existing procedures suffer from high variance due to the use of importance sampling over sequences of actions. To reduce this variance, we consider a *fixed sampling* approach, where players still update their policies over time, but with observations obtained through a given fixed sampling policy. Our approach is based on an adaptive Online Mirror Descent (OMD) algorithm that applies OMD locally to each information set, using individually decreasing learning rates and a *regularized loss*. We show that this approach guarantees a convergence rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/2})$ with high probability and has a near-optimal dependence on the game parameters when applied with the best theoretical choices of learning rates and sampling policies. To achieve these results, we generalize the notion of OMD stabilization, allowing for time-varying regularization with convex increments.

Local Curvature Smoothing with Stein's Identity for Efficient Score Matching
The training of score-based diffusion models (SDMs) is based on score matching. The challenge of score matching is that it includes a computationally expensive Jacobian trace. While several methods have been proposed to avoid this computation, each has drawbacks, such as instability during training and approximating the learning as learning a denoising vector field rather than a true score.We propose a novel score matching variant, local curvature smoothing with Stein's identity (LCSS). The LCSS bypasses the Jacobian trace by applying Stein's identity, enabling regularization effectiveness and efficient computation. We show that LCSS surpasses existing methods in sample generation performance and matches the performance of denoising score matching, widely adopted by most SDMs, in evaluations such as FID, Inception score, and bits per dimension. Furthermore, we show that LCSS enables realistic image generation even at a high resolution of $1024 \times 1024$.

Localize, Understand, Collaborate: Semantic-Aware Dragging via Intention Reasoner
Flexible and accurate drag-based editing is a challenging task that has recently garnered significant attention. Current methods typically model this problem as automatically learning “how to drag” through point dragging and often produce one deterministic estimation, which presents two key limitations: 1) Overlooking the inherently ill-posed nature of drag-based editing, where multiple results may correspond to a given input, as illustrated in Fig.1; 2) Ignoring the constraint of image quality, which may lead to unexpected distortion.To alleviate this, we propose LucidDrag, which shifts the focus from "how to drag" to a paradigm of "what-then-how."  LucidDrag comprises an intention reasoner and a collaborative guidance sampling mechanism. The former infers several optimal editing strategies, identifying what content and what semantic direction to be edited. Based on the former, the latter addresses "how to drag" by collaboratively integrating existing editing guidance with the newly proposed semantic guidance and quality guidance.Specifically, semantic guidance is derived by establishing a semantic editing direction based on reasoned intentions, while quality guidance is achieved through classifier guidance using an image fidelity discriminator.Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the superiority of LucidDrag over previous methods. The code will be released.

Localizing Memorization in SSL Vision Encoders
Recent work on studying memorization in self-supervised learning (SSL) suggests that even though SSL encoders are trained on millions of images, they still memorize individual data points. While effort has been put into characterizing the memorized data and linking encoder memorization to downstream utility, little is known about where the memorization happens inside SSL encoders. To close this gap, we propose two metrics for localizing memorization in SSL encoders on a per-layer (LayerMem) and per-unit basis (UnitMem). Our localization methods are independent of the downstream task, do not require any label information, and can be performed in a forward pass. By localizing memorization in various encoder architectures (convolutional and transformer-based) trained on diverse datasets with contrastive and non-contrastive SSL frameworks, we find that (1) while SSL memorization increases with layer depth, highly memorizing units are distributed across the entire encoder, (2) a significant fraction of units in SSL encoders experiences surprisingly high memorization of individual data points, which is in contrast to models trained under supervision, (3) atypical (or outlier) data points cause much higher layer and unit memorization than standard data points, and (4) in vision transformers, most memorization happens in the fully-connected layers. Finally, we show that localizing memorization in SSL has the potential to improve fine-tuning and to inform pruning strategies.

Local to Global: Learning Dynamics and Effect of Initialization for Transformers
In recent years, transformer-based models have revolutionized deep learning, particularly in sequence modeling. To better understand this phenomenon, there is a growing interest in using Markov input processes to study transformers. However, our current understanding in this regard remains limited with many fundamental questions about how transformers learn Markov chains still unanswered. In this paper, we address this by focusing on first-order Markov chains and single-layer transformers, providing a comprehensive characterization of the learning dynamics in this context. Specifically, we prove that transformer parameters trained on next-token prediction loss can either converge to global or local minima, contingent on the initialization and the Markovian data properties, and we characterize the precise conditions under which this occurs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind highlighting the role of initialization. We further demonstrate that our theoretical findings are corroborated by empirical evidence. Based on these insights, we provide guidelines for the initilization of transformer parameters and demonstrate their effectiveness. Finally, we outline several open problems in this arena.

LocCa: Visual Pretraining with Location-aware Captioners
Image captioning was recently found to be an effective pretraining method similar to contrastive pretraining. This opens up the largely-unexplored potential of using natural language as a flexible and powerful interface for handling diverse pretraining tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate this with a novel visual pretraining paradigm, LocCa, that incorporates location-aware tasks into captioners to teach models to extract rich information from images. Specifically, LocCa employs two tasks, bounding box prediction and location-dependent captioning, conditioned on the image pixel input. Thanks to the multitask capabilities of an encoder-decoder architecture, we show that an image captioner can effortlessly handle multiple tasks during pretraining. LocCa significantly outperforms standard captioners on downstream localization tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on RefCOCO/+/g, while maintaining comparable performance on holistic tasks. Our work paves the way for further exploration of natural language interfaces in visual pretraining.

Log-concave Sampling from a Convex Body with a Barrier: a Robust and Unified Dikin Walk
We consider the problem of sampling from a $d$-dimensional log-concave distribution $\pi(\theta) \propto \exp(-f(\theta))$ for $L$-Lipschitz $f$, constrained to a convex body (described by $n$ hyperplanes) equipped with a barrier function, contained in a ball of radius $R$ with a $w$-warm start. We propose a \emph{robust} sampling framework that computes spectral approximations to the Hessian of the barrier functions in each iteration. We prove that for the polytope constraints, sampling with the Lee-Sidford barrier function mixes within $\widetilde O((d^2+dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps with a per step cost of $\widetilde O(nd^{\omega-1})$, where $\omega\approx 2.37$ is the fast matrix multiplication exponent. Compared to the prior work of Mangoubi and Vishnoi, our approach gives faster mixing time as we are able to design a generalized soft-threshold Dikin walk beyond log-barrier.We further extend our result to show how to sample from a $d$-dimensional spectrahedron, the constrained set of a semidefinite program, specified by the set $\{x\in \mathbb{R}^d: \sum_{i=1}^d x_i A_i \succeq C \}$ where $A_1,\ldots,A_d, C$ are $n\times n$ real symmetric matrices. We design a walk that mixes in $\widetilde O((nd+dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps with a per iteration cost of $\widetilde O(n^\omega+n^2d^{3\omega-5})$. We improve the mixing time bound of prior best Dikin walk due to Narayanan and Rakhlin that mixes in $\widetilde O((n^2d^3+n^2dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps.

Logical characterizations of recurrent graph neural networks with reals and floats
In pioneering work from 2019, Barceló and coauthors identified logics that precisely match the expressive power of constant iteration-depth graph neural networks (GNNs) relative to properties definable in first-order logic. In this article, we give exact logical characterizations of recurrent GNNs in two scenarios: (1) in the setting with floating-point numbers and (2) with reals. For floats, the formalism matching recurrent GNNs is a rule-based modal logic with counting, while for reals we use a suitable infinitary modal logic, also with counting. These results give exact matches between logics and GNNs in the recurrent setting without relativising to a background logic in either case, but using some natural assumptions about floating-point arithmetic. Applying our characterizations, we also prove that, relative to graph properties definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO), our infinitary and rule-based logics are equally expressive. This implies that recurrent GNNs with reals and floats have the same expressive power over MSO-definable properties and shows that, for such properties, also recurrent GNNs with reals are characterized by a (finitary!) rule-based modal logic. In the general case, in contrast, the expressive power  with floats is weaker than with reals. In addition to logic-oriented results, we also characterize recurrent GNNs, with both reals and floats, via distributed automata,  drawing links to distributed computing models.

Long-range Brain Graph Transformer
Understanding communication and information processing among brain regions of interest (ROIs) is highly dependent on long-range connectivity, which plays a crucial role in facilitating diverse functional neural integration across the entire brain. However, previous studies generally focused on the short-range dependencies within brain networks while neglecting the long-range dependencies, limiting an integrated understanding of brain-wide communication. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive Long-range aware TransformER (ALTER), a brain graph transformer to capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs utilizing biased random walk. Specifically, we present a novel long-range aware strategy to explicitly capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs. By guiding the walker towards the next hop with higher correlation value, our strategy simulates the real-world brain-wide communication. Furthermore, by employing the transformer framework, ALERT adaptively integrates both short- and long-range dependencies between brain ROIs, enabling an integrated understanding of multi-level communication across the entire brain. Extensive experiments on ABIDE and ADNI datasets demonstrate that ALTER consistently outperforms generalized state-of-the-art graph learning methods (including SAN, Graphormer, GraphTrans, and LRGNN) and other graph learning based brain network analysis methods (including FBNETGEN, BrainNetGNN, BrainGNN, and BrainNETTF) in neurological disease diagnosis.

Long-range Meta-path Search on Large-scale Heterogeneous Graphs
Utilizing long-range dependency, a concept extensively studied in homogeneous graphs, remains underexplored in heterogeneous graphs, especially on large ones, posing two significant challenges: Reducing computational costs while maximizing effective information utilization in the presence of heterogeneity, and overcoming the over-smoothing issue in graph neural networks. To address this gap, we investigate the importance of different meta-paths and introduce an automatic framework for utilizing long-range dependency on heterogeneous graphs, denoted as Long-range Meta-path Search through Progressive Sampling (LMSPS). Specifically, we develop a search space with all meta-paths related to the target node type. By employing a progressive sampling algorithm, LMSPS dynamically shrinks the search space with hop-independent time complexity. Through a sampling evaluation strategy, LMSPS conducts a specialized and effective meta-path selection, leading to retraining with only effective meta-paths, thus mitigating costs and over-smoothing. Extensive experiments across diverse heterogeneous datasets validate LMSPS's capability in discovering effective long-range meta-paths, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LMSPS-BBEC.

Long-tailed Object Detection Pretraining: Dynamic Rebalancing Contrastive Learning with Dual Reconstruction
Although large-scale pretraining followed by downstream fine-tuning is a prevalent approach in object detection, it often underperforms on datasets with significant long-tailed distributions. Our investigation identifies biases originating not only from extreme imbalances in classifier weight norms but also from simplicity biases at the feature representation level. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel pretraining methodology, Dynamic Rebalancing Contrastive Learning with Dual Reconstruction (DRCL). This method seamlessly integrates holistic and object-level contrasts within a contrastive learning framework, utilizes a dynamic rebalancing technique that transitions from image-level to instance-level resampling, and implements a dual reconstruction strategy to preserve both natural appearance and internal semantic consistency. By synergistically combining self-supervised and supervised learning modalities, our approach substantially reduces pretraining time and resource demands. Demonstrating significant enhancements over traditional long-tailed detection methods, particularly for rare classes, our methodology achieves State-of-the-Art performance on the extensive LVIS dataset across multiple detection frameworks and backbone networks.

Lookback Prophet Inequalitites
Prophet inequalities are fundamental optimal stopping problems, where a decision-maker observes sequentially items with values sampled independently from known distributions, and must decide at each new observation to either stop and gain the current value or reject it irrevocably and move to the next step. This model is often too pessimistic and does not adequately represent real-world online selection processes. Potentially, rejectesd items can be revisited and a fraction of their value can be recovered. To analyze this problem, we consider general decay functions $D_1,D_2,\ldots$, quantifying the value to be recovered from a rejected item, depending on how far it has been observed in the past. We analyze how lookback improves, or not, the competitive ratio in prophet inequalities in different order models. We show that, under mild monotonicity assumptions on the decay functions, the problem can be reduced to the case where all the decay functions are equal to the same function $x \mapsto \gamma x$, where $\gamma = \inf_{x>0} \inf_{j \geq 1} D_j(x)/x$. Consequently, we focus on this setting and refine the analyses of the competitive ratios, with upper and lower bounds expressed as increasing functions of $\gamma$.

Looks Too Good To Be True: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Hallucinations in Generative Restoration Models
The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data.However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations – realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images.The presence of hallucinations introduces uncertainty regarding the reliability of the models' predictions, raising major concerns about their practical application.In this paper, we employ information-theory tools to investigate this phenomenon, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between mean squared-error distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through an analysis of single image super-resolution algorithms.Our work aims to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.

LoRA-GA: Low-Rank Adaptation with Gradient Approximation
Fine-tuning large-scale pretrained models is prohibitively expensive in terms of computational and memory costs. LoRA, as one of the most popular Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, offers a cost-effective alternative by fine-tuning an auxiliary low-rank model that has significantly fewer parameters. Although LoRA reduces the computational and memory requirements significantly at each iteration, extensive empirical evidence indicates that it converges at a considerably slower rate compared to full fine-tuning, ultimately leading to increased overall compute and often worse test performance. In our paper, we perform an in-depth investigation of the initialization method of LoRA and show that careful initialization (without any change of the architecture and the training algorithm) can significantly enhance both efficiency and performance. In particular, we introduce a novel initialization method, LoRA-GA (Low Rank Adaptation with Gradient Approximation), which aligns the gradients of low-rank matrix product with those of full fine-tuning at the first step. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-GA achieves a convergence rate comparable to that of full fine-tuning (hence being significantly faster than vanilla LoRA as well as various recent improvements) while simultaneously attaining comparable or even better performance. For example, on the subset of the GLUE dataset with T5-Base, LoRA-GA outperforms LoRA by 5.69% on average. On larger models such as Llama 2-7B, LoRA-GA shows performance improvements of 0.34, 11.52%, and 5.05% on MTbench, GSM8k, and Human-eval, respectively. Additionally, we observe up to 2-4 times convergence speed improvement compared to vanilla LoRA, validating its effectiveness in accelerating convergence and enhancing model performance.

Lorentz-Equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformers for High-Energy Physics
Extracting scientific understanding from particle-physics experiments requires solving diverse learning problems with high precision and good data efficiency. We propose the Lorentz Geometric Algebra Transformer (L-GATr), a new multi-purpose architecture for high-energy physics. L-GATr represents high-energy data in a geometric algebra over four-dimensional space-time and is equivariant under Lorentz transformations, the symmetry group of relativistic kinematics. At the same time, the architecture is a Transformer, which makes it versatile and scalable to large systems. L-GATr is first demonstrated on regression and classification tasks from particle physics. We then construct the first Lorentz-equivariant generative model: a continuous normalizing flow based on an L-GATr network, trained with Riemannian flow matching. Across our experiments, L-GATr is on par with or outperforms strong domain-specific baselines.

Loss Symmetry and Noise Equilibrium of Stochastic Gradient Descent
Symmetries exist abundantly in the loss function of neural networks. We characterize the learning dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) when exponential symmetries, a broad subclass of continuous symmetries, exist in the loss function. We establish that when gradient noises do not balance, SGD has the tendency to move the model parameters toward a point where noises from different directions are balanced. Here, a special type of fixed point in the constant directions of the loss function emerges as a candidate for solutions for SGD. As the main theoretical result, we prove that every parameter $\theta$ connects without loss function barrier to a unique noise-balanced fixed point $\theta^*$. The theory implies that the balancing of gradient noise can serve as a novel alternative mechanism for relevant phenomena such as progressive sharpening and flattening and can be applied to understand common practical problems such as representation normalization, matrix factorization, warmup, and formation of latent representations.

Low Degree Hardness for Broadcasting on Trees
We study the low-degree hardness of broadcasting on trees.Broadcasting on trees has been extensively studied in statistical physics, in computational biology in relation to phylogenetic reconstruction and in statistics and computer science in the context of block model inference,  and as a simple data model for algorithms that may require depth for inference. The inference of the root can be carried by celebrated Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm which achieves Bayes-optimal performance. Despite the fact that this algorithm runs in linear time (using real operations), recent works indicated that this algorithm in fact requires high level of complexity. Moitra, Mossel and Sandon constructed a chain for which estimating the root better than random (for a typical input) is $NC1$ complete. Kohler and Mossel constructed chains such that for trees with $N$ leaves, recovering the root better than random requires a polynomial of degree $N^{\Omega(1)}$. Both works above asked if such complexity bounds hold in general below the celebrated {\em Kesten-Stigum} bound. In this work, we prove that this is indeed the case for low degree polynomials. We show that for the broadcast problem using any Markov chain on trees with $N$ leaves, below the Kesten Stigum bound, any $O(\log N)$ degree polynomial has vanishing correlation with the root.  Our result is one of the first low-degree lower bound that is proved in a setting that is not based or easily reduced to a product measure.

Lower Bounds and Optimal Algorithms for Non-Smooth Convex Decentralized Optimization over Time-Varying Networks
We consider the task of minimizing the sum of convex functions stored in a decentralized manner across the nodes of a communication network. This problem is relatively well-studied in the scenario when the objective functions are smooth, or the links of the network are fixed in time, or both. In particular, lower bounds on the number of decentralized communications and (sub)gradient computations required to solve the problem have been established, along with matching optimal algorithms. However, the remaining and most challenging setting of non-smooth decentralized optimization over time-varying networks is largely underexplored, as neither lower bounds nor optimal algorithms are known in the literature. We resolve this fundamental gap with the following contributions: (i) we establish the first lower bounds on the communication and subgradient computation complexities of solving non-smooth convex decentralized optimization problems over time-varying networks; (ii) we develop the first optimal algorithm that matches these lower bounds and offers substantially improved theoretical performance compared to the existing state of the art.

Lower Bounds of Uniform Stability in Gradient-Based Bilevel Algorithms for Hyperparameter Optimization
Gradient-based bilevel programming leverages unrolling differentiation (UD) or implicit function theorem (IFT) to solve hyperparameter optimization (HO) problems, and is proven effective and scalable in practice. To understand the generalization behavior, existing work establishes upper bounds of uniform stability in these algorithms, while their tightness is still unclear. To this end, this paper attempts to establish lower bounds for UD-based and IFT-based algorithms. The intricate behavior of bilevel programming, i.e. the dependence of each outer-level update on the current turn of inner optimization, poses challenges for deriving stability lower bounds.To address this problem, we introduce lower-bounded expansion properties to characterize the instability in update rules which can serve as general tools for lower-bound analysis. These properties guarantee the hyperparameter divergence at the outer level and the Lipschitz constant of inner output at the inner level in the context of HO.Guided by these insights, we construct a quadratic example that yields tight lower bounds for UD-based algorithms and meaningful bounds for representative IFT-based algorithms.Our tight result indicates that uniform stability has reached its limit in stability analysis for UD-based algorithms.

Low-Rank Optimal Transport through Factor Relaxation with Latent Coupling
Optimal transport (OT) is a general framework for finding a minimum-cost transport plan, or coupling, between probability distributions, and has many applications in machine learning. A key challenge in applying OT to massive datasets is the quadratic scaling of the coupling matrix with the size of the dataset. Low-rank OT methods [Forrow et al. 2019, Scetbon et al. 2021] address this problem by optimizing factored couplings. We derive an alternative parameterization of the low-rank problem based on the _latent coupling_ (LC) factorization previously introduced by [Lin et al. 2021] in the context of hierarchical OT.  The LC factorization has multiple  advantages for low-rank OT including decoupling the problem into three OT problems and greater flexibility and interpretability. We leverage these advantages to derive a new algorithm _Factor Relaxation with Latent Coupling_ (FRLC), which uses _coordinate_ mirror descent  to compute the LC factorization. FRLC handles multiple OT objectives (Wasserstein, Gromov-Wasserstein, Fused Gromov-Wasserstein), and marginal constraints (balanced, unbalanced, and semi-relaxed) with linear space complexity. We provide theoretical results on FRLC, and demonstrate superior performance on diverse applications -- including graph clustering and spatial transcriptomics --  while demonstrating its interpretability.

LRM-Zero: Training Large Reconstruction Models with Synthesized Data
We present LRM-Zero, a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) trained entirely on synthesized 3D data, achieving high-quality sparse-view 3D reconstruction. The core of LRM-Zero is our procedural 3D dataset, Zeroverse, which is automatically synthesized from simple primitive shapes with random texturing and augmentations (e.g., height fields, boolean differences, and wireframes). Unlike previous 3D datasets (e.g., Objaverse) which are often captured or crafted by humans to approximate real 3D data, Zeroverse completely ignores realistic global semantics but is rich in complex geometric and texture details that are locally similar to or even more intricate than real objects. We demonstrate that our LRM-Zero, trained with our fully synthesized Zeroverse, can achieve high visual quality in the reconstruction of real-world objects, competitive with models trained on Objaverse. We also analyze several critical design choices of Zeroverse that contribute to LRM-Zero's capability and training stability. Our work demonstrates that 3D reconstruction, one of the core tasks in 3D vision, can potentially be addressed without the semantics of real-world objects. We will release Zeroverse's procedural synthesis code to support future research. Interactive visualization is available at our anonymous website: https://lrmzero.github.io/.

L-TTA: Lightweight Test-Time Adaptation Using a Versatile Stem Layer
Test-time adaptation (TTA) is the most realistic methodology for adapting deep learning models to the real world using only unlabeled data from the target domain. Numerous TTA studies in deep learning have aimed at minimizing entropy. However, this necessitates forward/backward processes across the entire model and is limited by the incapability to fully leverage data based solely on entropy. This study presents a groundbreaking TTA solution that involves a departure from the conventional focus on minimizing entropy. Our innovative approach uniquely remodels the stem layer (i.e., the first layer) to emphasize minimizing a new learning criterion, namely, uncertainty. This method requires minimal involvement of the model's backbone, with only the stem layer participating in the TTA process. This approach significantly reduces the memory required for training and enables rapid adaptation to the target domain with minimal parameter updates. Moreover, to maximize data leveraging, the stem layer applies a discrete wavelet transform to the input features. It extracts multi-frequency domains and focuses on minimizing their individual uncertainties. The proposed method integrated into ResNet-26 and ResNet-50 models demonstrates its robustness by achieving outstanding TTA performance while using the least amount of memory compared to existing studies on CIFAR-10-C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-C benchmark datasets.

LucidAction: A Hierarchical and Multi-model Dataset for Comprehensive Action Quality Assessment
Action Quality Assessment (AQA) research confronts formidable obstacles due to limited, mono-modal datasets sourced from one-shot competitions, which hinder the generalizability and comprehensiveness of AQA models. To address these limitations, we present LucidAction, the first systematically collected multi-view AQA dataset structured on curriculum learning principles. LucidAction features a three-tier hierarchical structure, encompassing eight diverse sports events with four curriculum levels, facilitating sequential skill mastery and supporting a wide range of athletic abilities. The dataset encompasses multi-modal data, including multi-view RGB video, 2D and 3D pose sequences, enhancing the richness of information available for analysis. Leveraging a high-precision multi-view Motion Capture (MoCap) system ensures precise capture of complex movements. Meticulously annotated data, incorporating detailed penalties from professional gymnasts, ensures the establishment of robust and comprehensive ground truth annotations. Experimental evaluations employing diverse contrastive regression baselines on LucidAction elucidate the dataset's complexities. Through ablation studies, we investigate the advantages conferred by multi-modal data and fine-grained annotations, offering insights into improving AQA performance. The data and code will be openly released to support advancements in the AI sports field.

Lumina-Next : Making Lumina-T2X Stronger and Faster with Next-DiT
Lumina-T2X is a nascent family of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) that establishes a unified framework for transforming noise into various modalities, such as images and videos, conditioned on text instructions. Despite its promising capabilities, Lumina-T2X still encounters challenges including training instability, slow inference, and extrapolation artifacts. In this paper, we present Lumina-Next, an improved version of Lumina-T2X, showcasing stronger generation performance with increased training and inference efficiency. We begin with a comprehensive analysis of the Flag-DiT architecture and identify several suboptimal components, which we address by introducing the Next-DiT architecture with 3D RoPE and sandwich normalizations. To enable better resolution extrapolation, we thoroughly compare different context extrapolation methods applied to text-to-image generation with 3D RoPE, and propose Frequency- and Time-Aware Scaled RoPE tailored for diffusion transformers. Additionally, we introduce a sigmoid time discretization schedule for diffusion sampling, which achieves high-quality generation in 5-10 steps combined with higher-order ODE solvers. Thanks to these improvements, Lumina-Next not only improves the basic text-to-image generation but also demonstrates superior resolution extrapolation capabilities as well as multilingual generation using decoder-based LLMs as the text encoder, all in a zero-shot manner. To further validate Lumina-Next as a versatile generative framework, we instantiate it on diverse tasks including visual recognition, multi-views, audio, music, and point cloud generation, showcasing strong performance across these domains. By releasing all codes and model weights, we aim to advance the development of next-generation generative AI capable of universal modeling.

LuSh-NeRF: Lighting up and Sharpening NeRFs for Low-light Scenes
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown remarkable performances in producing novel-view images from high-quality scene images. However, hand-held low-light photography challenges NeRFs as the captured images may simultaneously suffer from low visibility, noise, and camera shakes. While existing NeRF methods may handle either low light or motion, directly combining them or incorporating additional image-based enhancement methods does not work as these degradation factors are highly coupled. We observe that noise in low-light images is always sharp regardless of camera shakes, which implies an implicit order of these degradation factors within the image formation process. This inspires us to explore such an order to decouple and remove these degradation factors while training the NeRF. To this end, we propose in this paper a novel model, named LuSh-NeRF, which can reconstruct a clean and sharp NeRF from a group of hand-held low-light images. The key idea of LuSh-NeRF is to sequentially model noise and blur in the images via multi-view feature consistency and frequency information of NeRF, respectively. Specifically, LuSh-NeRF includes a novel Scene-Noise Decomposition (SND) module for decoupling the noise from the scene representation and a novel Camera Trajectory Prediction (CTP) module for the estimation of camera motions based on low-frequency scene information. To facilitate training and evaluations, we construct a new dataset containing both synthetic and real images. Experiments show that LuSh-NeRF outperforms existing approaches. We will release the code and dataset.

M3LEO: A Multi-Modal, Multi-Label Earth Observation Dataset Integrating Interferometric SAR and RGB Data
Satellite-based remote sensing has revolutionised the way we address global chal-lenges in a rapidly evolving world. Huge quantities of Earth Observation (EO) dataare generated by satellite sensors daily, but processing these large datasets for use inML pipelines is technically and computationally challenging. Specifically, differenttypes of EO data are often hosted on a variety of platforms, with differing degreesof availability for Python preprocessing tools. In addition, spatial alignment acrossdata sources and data tiling for easier handling can present significant technicalhurdles for novice users. While some preprocessed Earth observation datasets exist,their content is often limited to optical or near-optical wavelength data, which isineffective at night or in adverse weather conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR), an active sensing technique based on microwave length radiation, offersa viable alternative. However, the application of machine learning to SAR hasbeen limited due to a lack of ML-ready data and pipelines, particularly for the fulldiversity of SAR data, including polarimetry, coherence and interferometry. In thiswork, we introduce M3LEO, a multi-modal, multi-label Earth observation datasetthat includes polarimetric, interferometric, and coherence SAR data derived fromSentinel-1, alongside Sentinel-2 RGB imagery and a suite of labelled tasks formodel evaluation. M3LEO spans 17.5TB and contains approximately 10M datachips, each measuring 4x4 km, across six diverse geographic regions. The datasetis complemented by a flexible PyTorch Lightning framework, with configurationmanagement using Hydra, to accommodate its use across diverse ML applicationsin Earth observation. Additionally, we provide tools to process any dataset availableon popular platforms such as Google Earth Engine for seamless integration withour framework. Initial experiments validate the utility of our data and framework,and show that SAR imagery contains information additional to that extractablefrom RGB data alone. Data is available at huggingface.co/M3LEO, and code atgithub.com/spaceml-org/M3LEO.

MAC Advice for facility location mechanism design
Algorithms with predictions are gaining traction across various domains, as a way to surpass traditional worst-case bounds through (machine-learned) advice. We study the canonical problem of $k$-facility location mechanism design,where the $n$ agents are strategic and might misreport their locations. We receive a prediction for each agent's location, and these predictions are crucially allowed to be only "mostly" and "approximately" correct (MAC for short): a $\delta$-fraction of the predicted locations are allowed to be arbitrarily incorrect, and the remainder of the predictions are required to be correct up to an $\varepsilon$-error. Moreover, we make no assumption on the independence of the errors.Can such "flawed" predictions allow us to beat the current best bounds for strategyprooffacility location?We show how natural robustness of the $1$-median (also known as the geometric median) of a set of points leads to an algorithm for single-facility location with MAC predictions. We extend our results to a natural "balanced" variant of the $k$-facility case, and show that without balancedness, robustness completely breaks down even for $k=2$ facilities on a line. As our main result, for this "unbalanced" setting we devise a truthful random mechanism, which outperforms the best known mechanism (with no predictions) by Lu et al.~[2010]. En route, we introduce the problem of "second" facility location, in which the first facility location is already fixed. Our robustness findings may be of independent interest, as quantitative versions of classic breakdown-point results in robust statistics.

MADiff: Offline Multi-agent Learning with Diffusion Models
Diffusion model (DM), as a powerful generative model, recently achieved huge success in various scenarios including offline reinforcement learning, where the policy learns to conduct planning by generating trajectory in the online evaluation. However, despite the effectiveness shown for single-agent learning, it remains unclear how DMs can operate in multi-agent problems, where agents can hardly complete teamwork without good coordination by independently modeling each agent's trajectories. In this paper, we propose MADiff, a novel generative multi-agent learning framework to tackle this problem. MADiff is realized with an attention-based diffusion model to model the complex coordination among behaviors of multiple agents. To the best of our knowledge, MADiff is the first diffusion-based multi-agent learning framework, which behaves as both a decentralized policy and a centralized controller. During decentralized executions, MADiff simultaneously performs teammate modeling, and the centralized controller can also be applied in multi-agent trajectory predictions. Our experiments show the superior performance of MADiff compared to baseline algorithms in a wide range of multi-agent learning tasks, which emphasizes the effectiveness of MADiff in modeling complex multi-agent interactions.

Make Fashion Real: Texture-preserving Rendered-to-Real Translation with Diffusion Models
Bridging the longstanding gap between rendering (computer graphics) and the real world remains a significant challenge. Particularly in the realm of fashion, existing methods still struggle to produce realistic and consistent results. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework that effectively translates rendered images into realistic counterparts, ensuring the preservation of texture details. Our approach comprises two primary stages: Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI) and Realistic Image Generation (RIG). In the DKI stage, the rendered-to-real domain-specific knowledge is injected into the pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model through positive domain finetuning and negative domain embedding, enhancing its capability to generate realistic images. Subsequently, the RIG stage employs a Texture-preserving Attention Control (TAC) specifically designed to maintain fine-grained clothing textures during image generation. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset named SynFashion, featuring detailed digital high-resolution clothing with diverse textures, which will be made public available for rendered fashion applications. Extensive experimental results show the superiority and effectiveness of our method in rendered-to-real image translation.

MALT Powers Up Adversarial Attacks
Current adversarial attacks for multi-class classifiers choose potential adversarial target classes naively based on the classifier's confidence levels. We present a novel adversarial targeting method, \textit{MALT - Mesoscopic Almost Linearity Targeting}, based on local almost linearity assumptions. Our attack wins over the current state of the art AutoAttack on the standard benchmark datasets CIFAR-100 and Imagenet and for different robust models. In particular, our attack uses a \emph{five times faster} attack strategy than AutoAttack's while successfully matching AutoAttack's successes and attacking additional samples that were previously out of reach. We additionally prove formally and demonstrate empirically that our targeting method, although inspired by linear predictors, also applies to non-linear models.

MambaAD: Exploring State Space Models for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
Recent advancements in anomaly detection have seen the efficacy of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Mamba-based models, with their superior long-range modeling and linear efficiency, have garnered substantial attention. This study pioneers the application of Mamba to multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection, presenting MambaAD, which consists of a pre-trained encoder and a Mamba decoder featuring (Locality-Enhanced State Space) LSS modules at multi-scales. The proposed LSS module, integrating parallel cascaded (Hybrid State Space) HSS blocks and multi-kernel convolutions operations, effectively captures both long-range and local information. The HSS block, utilizing (Hybrid Scanning) HS encoders, encodes feature maps into five scanning methods and eight directions, thereby strengthening global connections through the (State Space Model) SSM. The use of Hilbert scanning and eight directions significantly improves feature sequence modeling. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse anomaly detection datasets and seven metrics demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, substantiating the method's effectiveness.

MambaLLIE: Implicit Retinex-Aware Low Light Enhancement with Global-then-Local State Space
Recent advances in low light image enhancement have been dominated by Retinex-based learning framework, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers. However, the vanilla Retinex theory primarily addresses global illumination degradation and neglects local issues such as noise and blur in dark conditions. Moreover, CNNs and Transformers struggle to capture global degradation due to their limited receptive fields. While state space models (SSMs) have shown promise in the long-sequence modeling, they face challenges in combining local invariants and global context in visual data. In this paper, we introduce MambaLLIE, an implicit Retinex-aware low light enhancer featuring a global-then-local state space design. We first propose a Local-Enhanced State Space Module (LESSM) that incorporates an augmented local bias within a 2D selective scan mechanism, enhancing the original SSMs by preserving local 2D dependency. Additionally, an Implicit Retinex-aware Selective Kernel module (IRSK) dynamically selects features using spatially-varying operations, adapting to varying inputs through an adaptive kernel selection process. Our Global-then-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) integrates LESSM and IRSK with layer normalization (LN) as its core. This design enables MambaLLIE to achieve comprehensive global long-range modeling and flexible local feature aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaLLIE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer-based methods.

MambaTalk: Co-Speech Gesture Generation with Selective State Space Models
Gesture synthesis is a vital realm of human-computer interaction, with wide-ranging applications across various fields like film, robotics, and virtual reality. Recent advancements have utilized the diffusion model to improve gesture synthesis. However, the high computational complexity of these techniques limits the application in reality. In this study, we explore the potential of state space models (SSMs).Direct application of SSMs in gesture synthesis encounters difficulties, which stem primarily from the diverse movement dynamics of various body parts. The generated gestures may also exhibit unnatural jittering issues.To address these, we implement a two-stage modeling strategy with discrete motion priors to enhance the quality of gestures.Built upon the selective scan mechanism, we introduce MambaTalk, which integrates hybrid fusion modules, local and global scans to refine latent space representations.Subjective and objective experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art models.

MaNo: Exploiting Matrix Norm for Unsupervised Accuracy Estimation Under Distribution Shifts
Leveraging the model’s outputs, specifically the logits, is a common approach to estimating the test accuracy of a pre-trained neural network on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples without requiring access to the corresponding ground-truth labels. Despite their ease of implementation and computational efficiency, current logit-based methods are vulnerable to overconfidence issues, leading to prediction bias, especially under the natural shift. In this work, we first study the relationship between logits and generalization performance from the view of low-density separation assumption. Our findings motivate our proposed method MANO that 1) applies a data-dependent normalization on the logits to reduce prediction bias, and 2) takes the $L_p$ norm of the matrix of normalized logits as the estimation score. Our theoretical analysis highlights the connection between the provided score and the model's uncertainty. We conduct an extensive empirical study on common unsupervised accuracy estimation benchmarks and demonstrate that MANO achieves state-of-the-art performance across various architectures in the presence of synthetic, natural, or subpopulation shifts.

Map It Anywhere: Empowering BEV Map Prediction using Large-scale Public Datasets
Top-down Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps are a popular representation for ground robot navigation due to their richness and flexibility for downstream tasks. While recent methods have shown promise for predicting BEV maps from First-Person View (FPV) images, their generalizability is limited to small regions captured by current autonomous vehicle-based datasets.In this context, we show that a more scalable approach towards generalizable map prediction can be enabled by using two large-scale crowd-sourced mapping platforms, Mapillary for FPV images and OpenStreetMap for BEV semantic maps.We introduce Map It Anywhere (MIA), a data engine that enables seamless curation and modeling of labeled map prediction data from existing open-source map platforms.Using our MIA data engine, we display the ease of automatically collecting a 1.2 million FPV & BEV pair dataset encompassing diverse geographies, landscapes, environmental factors, camera models & capture scenarios.We further train a simple camera model-agnostic model on this data for BEV map prediction.Extensive evaluations using established benchmarks and our dataset show that the data curated by MIA enables effective pretraining for generalizable BEV map prediction, with zero-shot performance far exceeding baselines trained on existing datasets by 35%.Our analysis highlights the promise of using large-scale public maps for developing & testing generalizable BEV perception, paving the way for more robust autonomous navigation.

Marginalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Linear Mixed-Effects Models
Bayesian reasoning in linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) is challenging and often requires advanced sampling techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). A common approach is to write the model in a probabilistic programming language and then sample via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). However, there are many ways a user can transform a model that make HMC more or less efficient.In particular, marginalizing some variables can greatly improve HMC but is difficult for users to do manually. We develop an algorithm to easily marginalize random effects in LMMs. A naive approach introduces cubic time operations within HMC, but we reduce the running time to linear using fast linear algebra techniques. We show that marginalization is always beneficial when applicable and highlight improvements in various models, especially ones from cognitive sciences.

Markovian Flow Matching: Accelerating MCMC with Continuous Normalizing Flows
Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) learn the probability path between a reference and a target density by modeling the vector field generating said path using neural networks. Recently,  Lipman et al. (2022) introduced a simple and inexpensive method for training CNFs in generative modeling, termed flow matching (FM). In this paper, we re-purpose this method for probabilistic inference by incorporating Markovian sampling methods in evaluating the FM objective and using the learned probability path to improve Monte Carlo sampling. We propose a sequential method, which uses samples from a Markov chain to fix the probability path defining the FM objective. We augment this scheme with an adaptive tempering mechanism that allows the discovery of multiple modes in the target. Under mild assumptions, we establish convergence to a local optimum of the FM objective, discuss improvements in the convergence rate, and illustrate our methods on synthetic and real-world examples.

Masked Hard-Attention Transformers Recognize Exactly the Star-Free Languages
The expressive power of transformers over inputs of unbounded size can be studied through their ability to recognize classes of formal languages. We consider transformer encoders with hard attention (in which all attention is focused on exactly one position) and strict future masking (in which each position only attends to positions strictly to its left), and prove that they are equivalent to linear temporal logic (LTL), which defines exactly the star-free languages. A key technique is the use of Boolean RASP as a convenient intermediate language between transformers and LTL. We then take numerous results known for LTL and apply them to transformers, characterizing how position embeddings, strict masking, and depth increase expressive power.

Masked Pre-training Enables Universal Zero-shot Denoiser
In this work, we observe that model trained on vast general images via masking strategy, has been naturally embedded with their distribution knowledge, thus spontaneously attains the underlying potential for strong image denoising.Based on this observation, we propose a novel zero-shot denoising paradigm, i.e., $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{P}$re-train then $\textbf{I}$terative fill ($\textbf{MPI}$).MPI first trains model via masking and then employs pre-trained weight for high-quality zero-shot image denoising on a single noisy image.Concretely, MPI comprises two key procedures:$\textbf{1) Masked Pre-training}$ involves training model to reconstruct massive natural images with random masking for generalizable representations, gathering the potential for valid zero-shot denoising on images with varying noise degradation and even in distinct image types.$\textbf{2) Iterative filling}$ exploits pre-trained knowledge for effective zero-shot denoising. It iteratively optimizes the image by leveraging pre-trained weights, focusing on alternate reconstruction of different image parts, and gradually assembles fully denoised image within limited number of iterations.Comprehensive experiments across various noisy scenarios underscore the notable advances of MPI over previous approaches with a marked reduction in inference time.

MaskFactory: Towards High-quality Synthetic Data Generation For Dichotomous Image Segmentation
Dichotomous Image Segmentation (DIS) tasks require highly precise annotations, and traditional dataset creation methods are labor intensive, costly, and require extensive domain expertise. Although using synthetic data for DIS is a promising solution to these challenges, current generative models and techniques struggle with the issues of scene deviations, noise-induced errors, and limited training sample variability. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach, MaskFactory, which provides a scalable solution for generating diverse and precise datasets, markedly reducing preparation time and costs. We first introduce a general mask editing method that combines rigid and non-rigid editing techniques to generate high-quality synthetic masks. Specially, rigid editing leverages geometric priors from diffusion models to achieve precise viewpoint transformations under zero-shot conditions, while non-rigid editing employs adversarial training and self-attention mechanisms for complex, topologically consistent modifications. Then, we generate pairs of high-resolution image and accurate segmentation mask using a multi-conditional control generation method. Finally, our experiments on the widely-used DIS5K dataset benchmark demonstrate superior performance in quality and efficiency compared to existing methods. Codes will be publicly available.

Matrix Denoising with Doubly Heteroscedastic Noise: Fundamental Limits and Optimal Spectral Methods
We study the matrix denoising problem of estimating the singular vectors of a rank-$1$ signal corrupted by noise with both column and row correlations. Existing works are either unable to pinpoint the exact asymptotic estimation error or, when they do so, the resulting approaches (e.g., based on whitening or singular value shrinkage) remain vastly suboptimal. On top of this, most of the literature has focused on the special case of estimating the left singular vector of the signal when the noise only possesses row correlation (one-sided heteroscedasticity). In contrast, our work establishes the information-theoretic and algorithmic limits of matrix denoising with doubly heteroscedastic noise. We characterize the exact asymptotic minimum mean square error, and design a novel spectral estimator with rigorous optimality guarantees: under a technical condition, it attains positive correlation with the signals whenever information-theoretically possible and, for one-sided heteroscedasticity, it also achieves the Bayes-optimal error. Numerical experiments demonstrate the significant advantage of our theoretically principled method with the state of the art. The proofs draw connections with statistical physics and approximate message passing, departing drastically from standard random matrix theory techniques.

MatrixNet: Learning over symmetry groups using learned group representations
Group theory has been used in machine learning to provide a theoretically grounded approach for incorporating known symmetry transformations in tasks from robotics to protein modeling. In these applications, equivariant neural networks use known symmetry groups with predefined representations to learn over geometric input data. We propose MatrixNet, a neural network architecture that learns matrix representations of group element inputs instead of using predefined representations. MatrixNet achieves higher sample efficiency and generalization over several more general baselines in prediction tasks over the symmetric group and Artin braid group.  We additionally show that MatrixNet has better generalization to unseen group elements of greater word length than the training set.

MC-DiT: Contextual Enhancement via Clean-to-Clean Reconstruction for Masked Diffusion Models
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) is emerging as a cutting-edge trend in the landscape of generative diffusion models for image generation. Recently, masked-reconstruction strategies have been considered to improve the efficiency and semantic consistency in training DiT but suffer from deficiency in contextual information extraction. In this paper, we provide a new insight to reveal that noisy-to-noisy masked-reconstruction harms sufficient utilization of contextual information. We further demonstrate the insight with theoretical analysis and empirical study on the mutual information between unmasked and masked patches. Guided by such insight, we propose a novel training paradigm named MC-DiT for fully learning contextual information via diffusion denoising at different noise variances with clean-to-clean mask-reconstruction. Moreover, to avoid model collapse, we design two complementary branches of DiT decoders for enhancing the use of noisy patches and mitigating excessive reliance on clean patches in reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on 256$\times$256 and 512$\times$512 image generation on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the proposed MC-DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional and conditional image generation with enhanced convergence speed.

Mean-Field Langevin Dynamics for Signed Measures via a Bilevel Approach
Mean-field Langevin dynamics (MLFD) is a class of interacting particle methods that tackle convex optimization over probability measures on a manifold, which are scalable, versatile, and enjoy computational guarantees. However, some important problems -- such as risk minimization for infinite width two-layer neural networks, or sparse deconvolution -- are originally defined over the set of signed, rather than probability, measures. In this paper, we investigate how to extend the MFLD framework to convex optimization problems over signed measures.Among two known reductions from signed to probability measures -- the lifting and the bilevel approaches -- we show that the bilevel reduction leads to stronger guarantees and faster rates (at the price of a higher per-iteration complexity).In particular, we investigate the convergence rate of MFLD applied to the bilevel reduction in the low-noise regime and obtain two results. First, this dynamics is amenable to an annealing schedule, adapted from [Suzuki et al., 2023], that results in polynomial convergence rates to a fixed multiplicative accuracy. Second, we investigate the problem of learning a single neuron with the bilevel approach and obtain local exponential convergence rates that depend polynomially on the dimension and noise level (to compare with the exponential dependence that would result from prior analyses).

Measuring Progress in Dictionary Learning for Language Model Interpretability with Board Game Models
What latent features are encoded in language model (LM) representations? Recent work on training sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle interpretable features in LM representations has shown significant promise. However, evaluating the quality of these SAEs is difficult because we lack a ground-truth collection of interpretable features which we expect good SAEs to identify. We thus propose to measure progress in interpretable dictionary learning by working in the setting of LMs trained on Chess and Othello transcripts. These settings carry natural collections of interpretable features—for example, “there is a knight on F3”—which we leverage into metrics for SAE quality. To guide progress in interpretable dictionary learning, we introduce a new SAE training technique, $p$-annealing, which demonstrates improved performance on our metric.

Mechanism design augmented with output advice
Our work revisits the design of mechanisms via the learning-augmented framework. In this model, the algorithm is enhanced with imperfect (machine-learned) information concerning the input, usually referred to as prediction. The goal is to design algorithms whose performance degrades gently as a function of the prediction error and, in particular, perform well if the prediction is accurate, but also provide a worst-case guarantee under any possible error. This framework has been successfully applied recently to various mechanism design settings, where in most cases the mechanism is provided with a prediction about the types of the players.We adopt a perspective in which the mechanism is provided with an output recommendation. We make no assumptions about the quality of the suggested outcome, and the goal is to use the recommendation to design mechanisms with low approximation guarantees whenever the recommended outcome is reasonable, but at the same time to provide worst-case guarantees whenever the recommendation significantly deviates from the optimal one. We propose a generic, universal measure, which we call quality of recommendation, to evaluate mechanisms across various information settings. We demonstrate how this new metric can provide refined analysis in existing results.This model introduces new challenges, as the mechanism receives limited information comparing to settings that use predictions about the types of the agents. We study, through this lens, several well-studied mechanism design paradigms, devising new mechanisms, but also providing refined analysis for existing ones, using as a metric the quality of recommendation. We complement our positive results, by exploring the limitations of known classes of strategyproof mechanisms that can be devised using output recommendation.

Mechanism Design Through Exploration Control: Optimizing the Trade-Off Between User and Creator Engagement
On User-Generated Content (UGC) platforms, recommendation algorithms significantly impact creators' motivation to produce content as they compete for algorithmically allocated traffic. This phenomenon subtly shapes the volume and diversity of the content pool, which is crucial for the sustainability of the platform. In this work, we demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that a purely relevance-driven policy with low exploration strength boosts short-term user satisfaction but undermines the long-term richness of the content pool. This reveals an intrinsic trade-off between user engagement and content diversity on UGC platforms. Building on this finding, we propose an efficient optimization method to identify the optimal exploration strength, balancing user and creator engagement. Our model serves as a pre-deployment audit tool for UGC platforms, facilitating the alignment between their short-term and long-term goals.

Megalodon: Efficient LLM Pretraining and Inference with Unlimited Context Length
The quadratic complexity and weak length extrapolation of Transformers limits their ability to scale to long sequences, and while sub-quadratic solutions like linear attention and state space models exist, they empirically underperform Transformers in pretraining efficiency and downstream task accuracy. We introduce MEGALODON, an neural architecture for efficient sequence modeling with unlimited context length. MEGALODON inherits the architecture of MEGA (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability and stability, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA), timestep normalization layer, normalized attention mechanism and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration. In a controlled head-to-head comparison with LLAMA2, MEGALODON achieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens. MEGALODON reaches a training loss of 1.70, landing mid-way between LLAMA2-7B (1.75) and LLAMA2-13B (1.67). This result is robust throughout a wide range of benchmarks, where MEGALODON consistently outperforms Transformers across different tasks, domains, and modalities.

MeLLoC: Lossless Compression with High-order Mechanism Learning
Lossless compression of large-scale scientific floating-point data is critical yet challenging due to the presence of noise and high-order information that arises from model truncation and discretization errors. Existing entropy coding techniques fail to effectively leverage the mechanisms underlying the data generation process. This paper introduces MeLLoC(Mechanism Learning for Lossless Compression), a novel approach that combines high-order mechanism learning with classical encoding to enhance lossless compression for scientific data. The key idea is to treat the data as discrete samples from an underlying physical field described by differential equations, and solve an inverse problem to identify the governing equation coefficients exhibiting more compressible numeric representations. Periodic extension techniques are employed to accelerate the decompression. Through extensive experiments on various scientific datasets, MeLLoC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art lossless compressors while offering compelling trade-offs between compression ratios and computational costs. This work opens up new avenues for exploiting domain knowledge and high-order information to improve data compression in scientific computing.

Membership Inference on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Conditional Likelihood Discrepancy
Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in the field of controllable image generation, while also coming along with issues of privacy leakage and data copyrights. Membership inference arises in these contexts as a potential auditing method for detecting unauthorized data usage. While some efforts have been made on diffusion models, they are not applicable to text-to-image diffusion models due to the high computation overhead and enhanced generalization capabilities. In this paper, we first identify a conditional overfitting phenomenon in text-to-image diffusion models, indicating that these models tend to overfit the conditional distribution of images given the text rather than the marginal distribution of images. Based on this observation, we derive an analytical indicator, namely Conditional Likelihood Discrepancy (CLiD), to perform membership inference. This indicator reduces the stochasticity in estimating the memorization of individual samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across various data distributions and scales. Additionally, our method shows superior resistance to overfitting mitigation strategies such as early stopping and data augmentation.

MeMo: Meaningful, Modular Controllers via Noise Injection
Robots are often built from standardized assemblies, (e.g. arms, legs, or fingers), but each robot must be trained from scratch to control all the actuators of all the parts together. In this paper we demonstrate a new approach that takes a single robot and its controller as input and produces a set of modular controllers for each of these assemblies such that when a new robot is built from the same parts, its control can be quickly learned by reusing the modular controllers. We achieve this with a framework called MeMo which learns (Me)aningful, (Mo)dular controllers. Specifically, we propose a novel modularity objective to learn an appropriate division of labor among the modules. We demonstrate that this objective can be optimized simultaneously with standard behavior cloning loss via noise injection. We benchmark our framework in locomotion and grasping environments on simple to complex robot morphology transfer. We also show that the modules help in task transfer. On both structure and task transfer, MeMo achieves improved training efficiency to graph neural network and Transformer baselines.

Memorize What Matters: Emergent Scene Decomposition from Multitraverse
Humans naturally retain memories of permanent elements, while ephemeral moments often slip through the cracks of memory. This selective retention is crucial for perception, localization, and mapping. To endow robots with this capability, we introduce 3D Gaussian Mapping (3DGM), a self-supervised, camera-only offline mapping framework grounded in 3D Gaussian Splatting. 3DGM converts multitraverse RGB videos from the same region into a Gaussian-based environmental map, while concurrently performing 2D ephemeral object segmentation. Such environment-object decomposition exploits self-supervision from repeated traversals: the consensus and dissensus in images correspond, respectively, to the permanent environment and ephemeral objects in 3D. This is because the environment remains consistent across traversals, while objects frequently change. Specifically, 3DGM formulates multitraverse environmental mapping as a robust differentiable rendering problem, treating pixels of the environment and objects as inliers and outliers, respectively. Using robust feature distillation, feature residuals mining, and robust optimization, 3DGM jointly performs 3D mapping and 2D segmentation without human intervention. Moreover, we curate the Mapverse benchmark, sourced from the Ithaca365 and nuPlan datasets, to evaluate our method in unsupervised 2D segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and neural rendering. Extensive results verify our method's effectiveness and potential for self-driving applications, such as autolabeling, camera-only 3D reconstruction and neural simulation.

Memory-Efficient Gradient Unrolling for Large-Scale Bi-level Optimization
Bi-level optimizaiton (BO) has become a fundamental mathematical framework for addressing hierarchical machine learning problems.As deep learning models continue to grow in size, the demand for scalable bi-level optimization has become increasingly critical.Traditional gradient-based bi-level optimizaiton algorithms, due to their inherent characteristics, are ill-suited to meet the demands of large-scale applications.In this paper, we introduce **F**orward **G**radient **U**nrolling with **F**orward **G**radient, abbreviated as **$($FG$)^2$U**, which achieves an unbiased stochastic approximation of the meta gradient for bi-level optimizaiton.$($FG$)^2$U circumvents the memory and approximation issues associated with classical bi-level optimizaiton approaches, and delivers significantly more accurate gradient estimates than existing large-scale bi-level optimizaiton approaches.Additionally, $($FG$)^2$U is inherently designed to support parallel computing, enabling it to effectively leverage large-scale distributed computing systems to achieve significant computational efficiency.In practice, $($FG$)^2$U and other methods can be strategically placed at different stages of the training process to achieve a more cost-effective two-phase paradigm.Further, $($FG$)^2$U is easy to implement within popular deep learning frameworks, and can be conveniently adapted to address more challenging zeroth-order bi-level optimizaiton scenarios.We provide a thorough convergence analysis and a comprehensive practical discussion for $($FG$)^2$U, complemented by extensive empirical evaluations, showcasing its superior performance in diverse large-scale bi-level optimizaiton tasks.

MemoryFormer : Minimize Transformer Computation by Removing Fully-Connected Layers
In order to reduce the computational complexity of large language models, great efforts have been made to to improve the efficiency of transformer models such as linear attention and flash-attention. However, the model size and corresponding computational complexity are constantly scaled up in pursuit of higher performance.In this work, we present MemoryFormer, a novel transformer architecture which significantly reduces the computational complexity (FLOPs) from a new perspective.% as opposed to modifying the self-attention mechanism.We eliminate nearly all the computations of the transformer model except for the necessary computation required by the multi-head attention operation. This is made possible by utilizing an alternative method for feature transformation to replace the linear projection of fully-connected layers.Specifically, we first construct a group of in-memory lookup tables that store a large amount of discrete vectors to replace the weight matrix used in linear projection. We then use a hash algorithm to retrieve a correlated subset of vectors dynamically based on the input embedding. The retrieved vectors combined together will form the output embedding, which provides an estimation of the result of matrix multiplication operation in a fully-connected layer.Compared to conducting matrix multiplication, retrieving data blocks from memory is a much cheaper operation which requires little computations.We train MemoryFormer from scratch and conduct extensive experiments on various benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

MemVLT: Vision-Language Tracking with Adaptive Memory-based Prompts
Vision-language tracking (VLT) enhances traditional visual object tracking by integrating language descriptions, requiring the tracker to flexibly understand complex and diverse text in addition to visual information. However, most existing vision-language trackers still overly rely on initial fixed multimodal prompts, which struggle to provide effective guidance for dynamically changing targets. Fortunately, the Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory suggests that the human memory system can dynamically store and utilize multimodal perceptual information, thereby adapting to new scenarios. Inspired by this, (i) we propose a Memory-based Vision-Language Tracker (MemVLT). By incorporating memory modeling to adjust static prompts, our approach can provide adaptive prompts for tracking guidance. (ii) Specifically, the memory storage and memory interaction modules are designed in accordance with CLS theory. These modules facilitate the storage and flexible interaction between short-term and long-term memories, generating prompts that adapt to target variations. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on mainstream VLT datasets (e.g., MGIT, TNL2K, LaSOT and LaSOT$_{ext}$). Experimental results show that MemVLT achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Impressively, it achieves 69.4% AUC on the MGIT and 63.3% AUC on the TNL2K, improving the existing best result by 8.4% and 4.7%, respectively.

MeshFormer : High-Quality Mesh Generation with 3D-Guided Reconstruction Model
Open-world 3D reconstruction models have recently garnered significant attention. However, without sufficient 3D inductive bias, existing methods typically entail expensive training costs and struggle to extract high-quality 3D meshes. In this work, we introduce MeshFormer, a sparse-view reconstruction model that explicitly leverages 3D native structure, input guidance, and training supervision. Specifically, instead of using a triplane representation, we store features in 3D sparse voxels and combine transformers with 3D convolutions to leverage an explicit 3D structure and projective bias. In addition to sparse-view RGB input, we require the network to take input and generate corresponding normal maps. The input normal maps can be predicted by 2D diffusion models, significantly aiding in the guidance and refinement of the geometry's learning. Moreover, by combining Signed Distance Function (SDF) supervision with surface rendering, we directly learn to generate high-quality meshes without the need for complex multi-stage training processes. By incorporating these explicit 3D biases, MeshFormer can be trained efficiently and deliver high-quality textured meshes with fine-grained geometric details. It can also be integrated with 2D diffusion models to enable fast single-image-to-3D and text-to-3D tasks. **Videos are available at https://meshformer3d.github.io/**

Meta-Controller: Few-Shot Imitation of Unseen Embodiments and Tasks in Continuous Control
Generalizing across robot embodiments and tasks is crucial for adaptive robotic systems. Modular policy learning approaches adapt to new embodiments but are limited to specific tasks, while few-shot imitation learning (IL) approaches often focus on a single embodiment.In this paper, we introduce a few-shot behavior cloning framework to simultaneously generalize to unseen embodiments and tasks using a few (e.g., five) reward-free demonstrations. Our framework leverages a joint-level input-output representation to unify the state and action spaces of heterogeneous embodiments and employs a novel structure-motion state encoder that is parameterized to capture both shared knowledge across all embodiments and embodiment-specific knowledge. A matching-based policy network then predicts actions from a few demonstrations, producing an adaptive policy that is robust to over-fitting. Evaluated in the DeepMind Control suite, our framework termed Meta-Controller demonstrates superior few-shot generalization to unseen embodiments and tasks over modular policy learning and few-shot IL approaches.

Meta-Diffu$B$: A Contextualized Sequence-to-Sequence Text Diffusion Model with Meta-Exploration
The diffusion model, a new generative modeling paradigm, has achieved significant success in generating images, audio, video, and text. It has been adapted for sequence-to-sequence text generation (Seq2Seq) through DiffuSeq, termed S2S Diffusion. Existing S2S-Diffusion models predominantly rely on fixed or hand-crafted rules to schedule noise during the diffusion and denoising processes. However, these models are limited by non-contextualized noise, which fails to fully consider the characteristics of Seq2Seq tasks. In this paper, we propose the Meta-Diffu$B$ framework—a novel scheduler-exploiter S2S-Diffusion paradigm designed to overcome the limitations of existing S2S-Diffusion models. We employ Meta-Exploration to train an additional scheduler model dedicated to scheduling contextualized noise for each sentence. Our exploiter model, an S2S-Diffusion model, leverages the noise scheduled by our scheduler model for updating and generation. Meta-Diffu$B$ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous S2S-Diffusion models and fine-tuned pre-trained language models (PLMs) across four Seq2Seq benchmark datasets. We further investigate and visualize the impact of Meta-Diffu$B$'s noise scheduling on the generation of sentences with varying difficulties. Additionally, our scheduler model can function as a "plug-and-play" model to enhance DiffuSeq without the need for fine-tuning during the inference stage.

Meta-DT: Offline Meta-RL as Conditional Sequence Modeling with World Model Disentanglement
A longstanding goal of artificial general intelligence is highly capable generalists that can learn from diverse experiences and generalize to unseen tasks. The language and vision communities have seen remarkable progress toward this trend by scaling up transformer-based models trained on massive datasets, while reinforcement learning (RL) agents still suffer from poor generalization capacity under such paradigms. To tackle this challenge, we propose Meta Decision Transformer (Meta-DT), which leverages the sequential modeling ability of the transformer architecture and robust task representation learning via world model disentanglement to achieve efficient generalization in offline meta-RL. We pretrain a context-aware world model to learn a compact task representation, and inject it as a contextual condition to the causal transformer to guide task-oriented sequence generation. Then, we subtly utilize history trajectories generated by the meta-policy as a self-guided prompt to exploit the architectural inductive bias. We select the trajectory segment that yields the largest prediction error on the pretrained world model to construct the prompt, aiming to encode task-specific information complementary to the world model maximally. Notably, the proposed framework eliminates the requirement of any expert demonstration or domain knowledge at test time. Experimental results on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks across various dataset types show that Meta-DT exhibits superior few and zero-shot generalization capacity compared to strong baselines while being more practical with fewer prerequisites.

Meta-Exploiting Frequency Prior for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning
Meta-learning offers a promising avenue for few-shot learning (FSL), enabling models to glean a generalizable feature embedding through episodic training on synthetic FSL tasks in a source domain. Yet, in practical scenarios where the target task diverges from that in the source domain, meta-learning based method is susceptible to over-fitting. To overcome this, we introduce a novel framework, Meta-Exploiting Frequency Prior for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning, which is crafted to comprehensively exploit the cross-domain transferable image prior that each image can be decomposed into complementary low-frequency content details and high-frequency robust structural characteristics. Motivated by this insight, we propose to decompose each query image into its high-frequency and low-frequency components, and parallel incorporate them into the feature embedding network to enhance the final category prediction. More importantly, we introduce a feature reconstruction prior and a prediction consistency prior to separately encourage the consistency of the intermediate feature as well as the final category prediction between the original query image and its decomposed frequency components. This allows for collectively guiding the network's meta-learning process with the aim of learning generalizable image feature embeddings, while not introducing any extra computational cost in the inference phase. Our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results on multiple cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

MetaLA: Unified Optimal Linear Approximation to Softmax Attention Map
Various linear complexity models, such as Linear Transformer (LinFormer), State Space Model (SSM), and Linear RNN (LinRNN), have been proposed to replace the conventional softmax attention in Transformer structures. However, the optimal design of these linear models is still an open question. In this work, we attempt to answer this question by finding the best linear approximation to softmax attention from a theoretical perspective. We start by unifying existing linear complexity models as the linear attention form and then identify three conditions for the optimal linear attention design: (1) Dynamic memory ability; (2) Static approximation ability; (3) Least parameter approximation. We find that none of the current linear models meet all three conditions, resulting in suboptimal performance. Instead, we propose Meta Linear Attention (MetaLA) as a solution that satisfies these conditions. Our experiments on Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) task, language modeling, image classification, and Long-Range Arena (LRA) benchmark demonstrate that MetaLA is more effective than the existing linear models.

Metric Space Magnitude for Evaluating the Diversity of Latent Representations
The *magnitude* of a metric space is a novelinvariant that provides a measure of the 'effective size' of a space acrossmultiple scales, while also capturing numerous geometrical properties, such as curvature, density, or entropy.We develop a family of magnitude-based measures of the intrinsicdiversity of latent representations, formalising a novel notion ofdissimilarity between magnitude functions of finite metric spaces.Our measures are provably stable under perturbations of the data, can beefficiently calculated, and enable a rigorous multi-scale characterisation and comparison oflatent representations. We show their utility and superior performance across different domains and tasks, includingthe automated estimation of diversity,the detection of mode collapse, andthe evaluation of generative models for text, image, and graph data.

Metric Transforms and Low Rank Representations of Kernels
We introduce a new linear-algebraic tool based on Abelian group representation theory, and use it to address three key problems in machine learning.1. Past researchers have suggested fast algorithms for attention by approximating or replacing softmax attention with other functions like polynomials. The key mathematical property enabling fast algorithms is the polynomial method: any low-degree polynomial $f$ applied entry-wise to the matrix $QK^{\top}$ has low rank, when $Q$ and $K$ are $n \times d$ matrices and $n \gg d$.  This suggests a natural question: for what functions $f$ is such a low rank decomposition possible? If other functions $f$ exist, they could be used in place of softmax for subquadratic attention. It was previously known that polynomials have this low-rank decomposition property. We show that polynomials are the \textit{only} continuous functions with this property. This suggests that the low rank approach for fast attention computations can \textit{only} work for functions $f$ that are approximable by polynomials.2. We prove the first full classification of all positive definite kernels that are functions of Manhattan or $\ell_1$ distance. Our work generalizes an existing theorem at the heart of all kernel methods in machine learning: the classification of all positive definite kernels that are functions of Euclidean distance. 3. The key problem in metric transforms, a mathematical theory used in geometry and machine learning, asks what functions transform pairwise distances in semi-metric space $M$ to semi-metric space $N$ for specified $M$ and $N$. We provide the first full classification of functions that transform Manhattan distances to Manhattan distances. Our work generalizes the foundational work of Schoenberg, which fully classifies functions that transform Euclidean to Euclidean distances. We additionally prove results about stable-rank preserving functions that are potentially useful in algorithmic design, and more. Our core new tool is called the representation theory of the hyperrectangle.

MIDGArD: Modular Interpretable Diffusion over Graphs for Articulated Designs
Providing functionality through articulation and interaction with objects is a key objective in 3D generation. We introduce MIDGArD (Modular Interpretable Diffusion over Graphs for Articulated Designs), a novel diffusion-based framework for articulated 3D asset generation. MIDGArD improves over foundational work in the field by enhancing quality, consistency, and controllability in the generation process. This is achieved through MIDGArD's modular approach that separates the problem into two primary components: structure generation and shape generation. The structure generation module of MIDGArD aims at producing coherent articulation features from noisy or incomplete inputs. It acts on the object's structural and kinematic attributes, represented as features of a graph that are being progressively denoised to issue coherent and interpretable articulation solutions. This denoised graph then serves as an advanced conditioning mechanism for the shape generation module, a 3D generative model that populates each link of the articulated structure with consistent 3D meshes. Experiments show the superiority of MIDGArD on the quality, consistency, and interpretability of the generated assets. Importantly, the generated models are fully simulatable, i.e., can be seamlessly integrated into standard physics engines such as MuJoCo, broadening MIDGArD's applicability to fields such as digital content creation, meta realities, and robotics.

MILP-StuDio: MILP Instance Generation via Block Structure Decomposition
Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is one of the most popular mathematical formulations with numerous applications. In practice, improving the performance of MILP solvers often requires a large amount of high-quality data, which can be challenging to collect. Researchers thus turn to generation techniques to generate additional MILP instances. However, existing approaches do not take into account specific block structures—which are closely related to the problem formulations—in the constraint coefficient matrices (CCMs) of MILPs. Consequently, they are prone to generate computationally trivial or infeasible instances due to the disruptions of block structures and thus problem formulations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel MILP generation framework, called Block Structure Decomposition (MILP-StuDio), to generate high-quality instances by preserving the block structures. Specifically, MILP-StuDio begins by identifying the blocks in CCMs and decomposing the instances into block units, which serve as the building blocks of MILP instances. We then design three operators to construct new instances by removing, substituting, and appending block units in the original instances, enabling us to generate instances with flexible sizes. An appealing feature of MILP-StuDio is its strong ability to preserve the feasibility and computational hardness of the generated instances. Experiments on the commonly-used benchmarks demonstrate that using instances generated by MILP-StuDio is able to significantly reduce over 10% of the solving time for learning-based solvers.

Mind the Gap: A Causal Perspective on Bias Amplification in Prediction & Decision-Making
As society increasingly relies on AI-based tools for decision-making in socially sensitive domains, investigating fairness and equity of such automated systems has become a critical field of inquiry. Most of the literature in fair machine learning focuses on defining and achieving fairness criteria in the context of prediction, while not explicitly focusing on how these predictions may be used later on in the pipeline. For instance, if commonly used criteria, such as independence or sufficiency, are satisfied for a prediction score $S$ used for binary classification, they need not be satisfied after an application of a simple thresholding operation on $S$ (as commonly used in practice). In this paper, we take an important step to address this issue in numerous statistical and causal notions of fairness. We introduce the notion of a margin complement, which measures how much a prediction score $S$ changes due to a thresholding operation.We then demonstrate that the marginal difference in the optimal 0/1 predictor $\widehat Y$ between groups, written $P(\hat y \mid x_1) - P(\hat y \mid x_0)$, can be causally decomposed into the influences of $X$ on the $L_2$-optimal prediction score $S$ and the influences of $X$ on the margin complement $M$, along different causal pathways (direct, indirect, spurious). We then show that under suitable causal assumptions, the influences of $X$ on the prediction score $S$ are equal to the influences of $X$ on the true outcome $Y$. This yields a new decomposition of the disparity in the predictor $\widehat Y$ that allows us to disentangle causal differences inherited from the true outcome $Y$ that exists in the real world vs. those coming from the optimization procedure itself. This observation highlights the need for more regulatory oversight due to the potential for bias amplification, and to address this issue we introduce new notions of weak and strong business necessity, together with an algorithm for assessing whether these notions are satisfied. We apply our method to three real-world datasets and derive new insights on bias amplification in prediction and decision-making.

Mind the Gap Between Prototypes and Images in Cross-domain Few-shot Classification
In _cross-domain few-shot classification_ (CFC), recent works mainly focus on adapting a simple transformation head on top of a frozen pre-trained backbone with few labeled data to project embeddings into a task-specific metric space where classification can be performed by measuring similarities between image instance and prototype representations. Technically, an _assumption_ implicitly adopted in such a framework is that the prototype and image instance embeddings share the same representation transformation. However, in this paper, we find that there naturally exists a gap, which resembles the modality gap, between the prototype and image instance embeddings extracted from the frozen pre-trained backbone, and simply applying the same transformation during the adaptation phase constrains exploring the optimal representation distributions and shrinks the gap between prototype and image representations. To solve this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method, _contrastive prototype-image adaptation_ (CoPA), to adapt different transformations for prototypes and images similarly to CLIP by treating prototypes as text prompts.   Extensive experiments on Meta-Dataset demonstrate that CoPA achieves the _state-of-the-art_ performance more efficiently. Meanwhile, further analyses also indicate that CoPA can learn better representation clusters, enlarge the gap, and achieve the minimum validation loss at the enlarged gap.

Mind the Graph When Balancing Data for Fairness or Robustness
Failures of fairness or robustness in machine learning predictive settings can be due to undesired dependencies between covariates, outcomes and auxiliary factors of variation. A common strategy to mitigate these failures is data balancing, which attempts to remove those undesired dependencies. In this work, we define conditions on the training distribution for data balancing to lead to fair or robust models. Our results display that in many cases, the balanced distribution does not correspond to selectively removing the undesired dependencies in a causal graph of the task, leading to multiple failure modes and even interference with other mitigation techniques such as regularization. Overall, our results highlight the importance of taking the causal graph into account before performing data balancing.

Minimax Optimal and Computationally Efficient Algorithms for Distributionally Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning
Distributionally robust offline reinforcement learning (RL), which seeks robust policy training against environment perturbation by modeling dynamics uncertainty, calls for function approximations when facing large state-action spaces. However, the consideration of dynamics uncertainty introduces essential nonlinearity and computation burden, posing unique challenges for analyzing and practically employing function approximation. Focusing on a basic setting where the nominal model and perturbed models are linearly parameterized, we propose minimax optimal and computationally efficient algorithms realizing function approximation, and initiate the study on instance-dependent suboptimality analysis in the context of robust offline RL. Our results uncover that function approximation in robust offline RL is essentially distinct from and probably harder than that in standard offline RL. Our algorithms and theoretical results crucially depend on a variety of new techniques, involving a novel function approximation mechanism incorporating vari- ance information, a new procedure of suboptimality and estimation uncertainty decomposition, a quantification of the robust value function shrinkage, and a meticulously designed family of hard instances, which might be of independent interest.

Minimizing UCB: a Better Local Search Strategy in Local Bayesian Optimization
Local Bayesian optimization is a promising practical approach to solve the high dimensional black-box function optimization problem. Among them is the approximated gradient class of methods, which implements a strategy similar to gradient descent. These methods have achieved good experimental results and theoretical guarantees. However, given the distributional properties of the Gaussian processes applied on these methods, there may be potential to further exploit the information of the Gaussian processes to facilitate the BO search. In this work, we develop the relationship between the steps of the gradient descent method and one that minimizes the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and show that the latter can be a better strategy than direct gradient descent when a Gaussian process is applied as a surrogate. Through this insight, we propose a new local Bayesian optimization algorithm, MinUCB, which replaces the gradient descent step with minimizing UCB in GIBO. We further show that MinUCB maintains a similar convergence rate with GIBO. We then improve the acquisition function of MinUCB further through a look ahead strategy, and obtain a more efficient algorithm LA-MinUCB. We apply our algorithms on different synthetic and real-world functions, and the results show the effectiveness of our method. Our algorithms also illustrate improvements on local search strategies from an upper bound perspective in Bayesian optimization, and provides a new direction for future algorithm design.

Minimum Entropy Coupling with Bottleneck
This paper investigates a novel lossy compression framework operating under logarithmic loss, designed to handle situations where the reconstruction distribution diverges from the source distribution. This framework is especially relevant for applications that require joint compression and retrieval, and in scenarios involving distributional shifts due to processing. We show that the proposed formulation extends the classical minimum entropy coupling framework by integrating a bottleneck, allowing for controlled variability in the degree of stochasticity in the coupling.We explore the decomposition of the Minimum Entropy Coupling with Bottleneck (MEC-B) into two distinct optimization problems: Entropy-Bounded Information Maximization (EBIM) for the encoder, and Minimum Entropy Coupling (MEC) for the decoder. Through extensive analysis, we provide a greedy algorithm for EBIM with guaranteed performance, and characterize the optimal solution near functional mappings, yielding significant theoretical insights into the structural complexity of this problem.Furthermore, we illustrated the practical application of MEC-B through experiments in Markov Coding Games (MCGs) under rate limits. These games simulate a communication scenario within a Markov Decision Process, where an agent must transmit a compressed message from a sender to a receiver through its actions. Our experiments highlighted the trade-offs between MDP rewards and receiver accuracy across various compression rates, showcasing the efficacy of our method compared to conventional compression baseline.

Mining and Transferring Feature-Geometry Coherence for Unsupervised Point Cloud Registration
Point cloud registration, a fundamental task in 3D vision, has achieved remarkable success with learning-based methods in outdoor environments. Unsupervised outdoor point cloud registration methods have recently emerged to circumvent the need for costly pose annotations. However, they suffer from the poor quality of pseudo-labels due to inadequate integration of low-level geometric and high-level contextual information while discovering latent correspondences. We have observed that in the feature space, points of latent new inlier correspondences tend to cluster around respective positive anchors that summarize features of existing inliers. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel unsupervised registration method termed INTEGER to incorporate high-level contextual information for reliable pseudo-label mining. Specifically, we propose the Feature-Geometry Coherence Mining module to dynamically adapt the teacher for each mini-batch of data during training and discover reliable pseudo labels by considering both high-level feature representations and low-level geometric cues. Furthermore, we propose Anchor-Based Contrastive Learning to facilitate contrastive learning with anchors for a robust feature space. Lastly, we introduce a Mix-Density Student to learn density-invariant features, addressing challenges related to density variation and low overlap in the outdoor scenario.  Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our INTEGER achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and generalizability.

MINI-SEQUENCE TRANSFORMER: Optimizing Intermediate Memory for Long Sequences Training
We introduce MINI-SEQUENCE TRANSFORMER (MsT), a simple and effective methodology for highly efficient and accurate LLM training with extremely long sequences. By partitioning the input sequence and iteratively processing mini-sequences, MsT reduces intermediate memory usage for activation. Integrated with activation recomputation, it enables significant memory savings in both forward and backward passes. It supports any sequence length. Experiments show that up to 4x longer sequence lengths, there is no degradation of throughput or convergence using our method. Experiments on the Llama3-8b model demonstrate that MsT supports 12x longer sequence lengths than standard implementation and 4x longer than activation recomputation, maintains throughput and convergence equivalents, and is fully general and implementation-agnostic.

Mitigating Backdoor Attack by Injecting Proactive Defensive Backdoor
Data-poisoning backdoor attacks are serious security threats to machine learning models, where an adversary can manipulate the training dataset to inject backdoors into models. In this paper, we focus on in-training backdoor defense, aiming to train a clean model even when the dataset may be potentially poisoned. Unlike most existing methods that primarily detect and remove/unlearn suspicious samples to mitigate malicious backdoor attacks, we propose a novel defense approach called PDB (Proactive Defensive Backdoor). Specifically, PDB leverages the “home field” advantage of defenders by proactively injecting a defensive backdoor into the model during training. Taking advantage of controlling the training process, the defensive backdoor is designed to suppress the malicious backdoor effectively while remaining secret to attackers. In addition, we introduce a reversible mapping to determine the defensive target label. During inference, PDB embeds a defensive trigger in the inputs and reverses the model’s prediction, suppressing malicious backdoor and ensuring the model's utility on the original task. Experimental results across various datasets and models demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art defense performance against a wide range of backdoor attacks.

Mitigating Biases in Blackbox Feature Extractors for Image Classification Tasks
In image classification, it is common to utilize a pretrained model to extract meaningful features of the input images, and then to train a classifier on top of it to make predictions for any downstream task. Trained on enormous amounts of data, these models have been shown to contain harmful biases which can hurt their performance when adapted for a downstream classification task. Further, very often they may be blackbox, either due to scale, or because of unavailability of model weights or architecture. Thus, during a downstream task, we cannot debias such models by updating the weights of the feature encoder, as only the classifier can be finetuned. In this regard, we investigate the suitability of some existing debiasing techniques and thereby motivate the need for more focused research towards this problem setting. Furthermore, we propose a simple method consisting of a clustering-based adaptive margin loss with a blackbox feature encoder, with no knowledge of the bias attribute. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple benchmarks.

Mitigating Covariate Shift in Behavioral Cloning via Robust Distribution Correction Estimation
We consider offline imitation learning (IL), which aims to train an agent to imitate from the dataset of expert demonstrations without online interaction with the environment. Behavioral Cloning (BC) has been a simple yet effective approach to offline IL, but it is also well-known to be vulnerable to the covariate shift resulting from the mismatch between the state distributions induced by the learned policy and the data collection policy. In this paper, to mitigate the effect of covariate shift in BC, we formulate a robust BC training objective, and employ a stationary distribution correction ratio estimation (DICE) to derive a feasible solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method through an extensive set of experiments covering diverse covariate shift scenarios. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in improving the robustness against the shifts, outperforming existing offline IL methods in such scenarios.

Mitigating Spurious Correlations via Disagreement Probability
Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) are prone to be biased towards spurious correlations between target labels and bias attributes, which leads to poor performance on data groups lacking spurious correlations. It is particularly challenging to address this problem when access to bias labels is not permitted. To mitigate the effect of spurious correlations without bias labels, we first introduce a novel training objective designed to robustly enhance model performance across all data samples, irrespective of the presence of spurious correlations. From this objective, we then derive a debiasing method, Disagreement Probability based Resampling for debiasing (DPR), which does not require bias labels. DPR leverages the disagreement between the target label and the prediction of a biased model to identify bias-conflicting samples—those without spurious correlations—and upsamples them according to the disagreement probability. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DPR achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines that do not use bias labels. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis that details how DPR reduces dependency on spurious correlations.

Mixed Dynamics In Linear Networks: Unifying the Lazy and Active Regimes
The training dynamics of linear networks are well studied in two distinct setup: the lazy regime and balanced/active regime, depending on the initialization and width of the network. We provide a surprisingly simple unifying formula for the evolution of the learned matrix that contains as special cases both lazy and balanced regimes but also a mixed regime in between the two. In the mixed regime, a part of the network is lazy while the other is balanced. More precisely the network is lazy along singular values that are below a certain threshold and balanced along those that are above the same threshold. At initialization, all singular values are lazy, allowing for the network to align itself with the task, so that later in time, when some of the singular value cross the threshold and become active they will converge rapidly (convergence in the balanced regime is notoriously difficult in the absence of alignement). The mixed regime is the `best of both worlds': it converges from any random initialization (in contrast to balanced dynamics which require special initialization), and has a low rank bias (absent in the lazy dynamics). This allows us to prove an almost complete phase diagram of training behavior as a function of the variance at initialization and the width, for a MSE training task.

Mixture of Adversarial LoRAs: Boosting Robust Generalization in Meta-tuning
This paper introduces AMT, an \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{M}eta-\textbf{T}uning methodology, to boost the robust generalization of pre-trained models in the out-of-domain (OOD) few-shot learning. To address the challenge of transferring knowledge from source domains to unseen target domains, we construct the robust LoRAPool by meta-tuning LoRAs with double perturbations on both inputs and singular values and vectors at varying robustness levels. On top of that, we introduce a simple yet effective test-time merging mechanism for adaptively merging discriminative LoRAs for test-time task customization. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the AMT brings substantial improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods across a range of OOD few-shot image classification tasks on three benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of our approach to boost the robust generalization of pre-trained models.

ML with New Compute Paradigms
Digital computing is approaching fundamental limits and faces serious challenges in terms of scalability, performance, and sustainability. At the same time, generative AI is fuelling an explosion in compute demand. There is, thus, a growing need to explore non-traditional computing paradigms, such as (opto-)analog, neuromorphic hardware, and physical systems.Expanding on last year's successful NeurIPS workshop, which was the first of its kind in this community, we aim to bring together researchers from machine learning and alternative computation fields to establish new synergies between ML models and non-traditional hardware. Co-designing models with specialized hardware, a feature that has also been key to the synergy of digital chips like GPUs and deep learning, has the potential to offer a step change in the efficiency and sustainability of machine learning at scale. Beyond speeding up standard deep learning, new hardware may open the door for efficient inference and training of model classes that have been limited by compute resources, such as energy-based models and deep equilibrium models. So far, however, these hardware technologies have fallen short due to inherent noise, device mismatch, a limited set of compute operations, and reduced bit-depth. As a community, we need to develop new models and algorithms that can embrace and, in fact, exploit these characteristics. This workshop aims to encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration to exploit the opportunities offered by emerging AI accelerators both at training and at inference.

MMLU-Pro: A More Robust and Challenging Multi-Task Language Understanding Benchmark
In the age of large-scale language models, benchmarks like the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have been pivotal in pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in language comprehension and reasoning across diverse domains. However, as models continue to improve, their performance on these benchmarks has begun to plateau, making it increasingly difficult to discern differences in model capabilities. This paper introduces MMLU-Pro, an enhanced dataset designed to extend the mostly knowledge-driven MMLU benchmark by integrating more challenging, reasoning-focused questions and expanding the choice set from four to ten options. Additionally, MMLU-Pro eliminates part of the trivial and noisy questions in MMLU. Our experimental results show that MMLU-Pro not only raises the challenge, causing a significant drop in accuracy by 16\% to 33\% compared to MMLU, but also demonstrates greater stability under varying prompts. With 24 different prompt styles tested, the sensitivity of model scores to prompt variations decreased from 4-5\% in MMLU to just 2\% in MMLU-Pro. Additionally, we found that models utilizing Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning achieved better performance on MMLU-Pro compared to direct answering, which is in stark contrast to the findings on the original MMLU, indicating that MMLU-Pro includes more complex reasoning questions. Our assessments confirm that MMLU-Pro is more discriminative benchmark to better track progress in the field.

MO-DDN: A Coarse-to-Fine Attribute-based Exploration Agent for Multi-Object Demand-driven Navigation
The process of satisfying daily demands is a fundamental aspect of humans' daily lives. With the advancement of embodied AI, robots are increasingly capable of satisfying human demands. Demand-driven navigation (DDN) is a task in which an agent must locate an object to satisfy a specified demand instruction, such as ''I am thirsty.'' The previous study typically assumes that each demand instruction requires only one object to be fulfilled and does not consider individual preferences. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-object Demand-driven Navigation (MO-DDN) benchmark, which addresses these nuanced aspects, including multi-object search and personal preferences, thus making the MO-DDN task more reflective of real-life scenarios compared to DDN. Building upon previous work, we employ the concept of ''attribute'' to tackle this new task. However, instead of solely relying on attribute features in an end-to-end manner like DDN, we propose a modular method that involves constructing a coarse-to-fine attribute-based exploration agent. Our experimental results illustrate that this coarse-to-fine exploration strategy capitalizes on the advantages of attributes at various decision-making levels, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods.

Model Based Inference of Synaptic Plasticity Rules
Inferring the synaptic plasticity rules that govern learning in the brain is a key challenge in neuroscience. We present a novel computational method to infer these rules from experimental data, applicable to both neural and behavioral data. Our approach approximates plasticity rules using a parameterized function, employing either truncated Taylor series for theoretical interpretability or multilayer perceptrons. These plasticity parameters are optimized via gradient descent over entire trajectories to align closely with observed neural activity or behavioral learning dynamics. This method can uncover complex rules that induce long nonlinear time dependencies, particularly involving factors like postsynaptic activity and current synaptic weights. We validate our approach through simulations, successfully recovering established rules such as Oja's, as well as more intricate plasticity rules with reward-modulated terms. We assess the robustness of our technique to noise and apply it to behavioral data from \textit{Drosophila} in a probabilistic reward-learning experiment. Notably, our findings reveal an active forgetting component in reward learning in flies, improving predictive accuracy over previous models. This modeling framework offers a promising new avenue for elucidating the computational principles of synaptic plasticity and learning in the brain.

Model Collapse Demystified: The Case of Regression
The era of proliferation of large language and image generation models begs the question of what happens if models are trained on the synthesized outputs of other models. The phenomenon of "model collapse" refers to the situation whereby as a model is trained recursively on data generated from previous generations of itself over time, its performance degrades until the model eventually becomes completely useless, i.e.~the model collapses. In this work, we study this phenomenon in the setting of high-dimensional regression, under low- and high-dimensional asymptotics, and obtain analytic formulae which quantitatively outline this phenomenon in a broad range of regimes. We show how test error increases linearly in the number of model iterations in terms of all problem hyperparameters (covariance spectrum, regularization, label noise level, dataset size) and further isolate how model collapse affects both bias and variance terms. We show that even in the noise-free case, catastrophic (exponentially fast) model-collapse can happen in the over-parametrized regime.In the special case of polynomial decaying spectral and source conditions, we obtain modified scaling laws which exhibit new crossover phenomena from fast to slow rates. We also propose a simple strategy based on adaptive regularization to mitigate model collapse. Our theoretical results are validated with experiments.

Model Lego: Creating Models Like Disassembling and Assembling Building Blocks
With the rapid development of deep learning, the increasing complexity and scale of parameters make training a new model increasingly resource-intensive. In this paper, we start from the classic convolutional neural network (CNN) and explore a paradigm that does not require training to obtain new models. Similar to the birth of CNN inspired by receptive fields in the biological visual system, we draw inspiration from the information subsystem pathways in the biological visual system and propose Model Disassembling and Assembling (MDA). During model disassembling, we introduce the concept of relative contribution and propose a component locating technique to extract task-aware components from trained CNN classifiers. For model assembling, we present the alignment padding strategy and parameter scaling strategy to construct a new model tailored for a specific task, utilizing the disassembled task-aware components.The entire process is akin to playing with LEGO bricks, enabling arbitrary assembly of new models, and providing a novel perspective for model creation and reuse. Extensive experiments showcase that task-aware components disassembled from CNN classifiers or new models assembled using these components closely match or even surpass the performance of the baseline,demonstrating its promising results for model reuse. Furthermore, MDA exhibits diverse potential applications, with comprehensive experiments exploring model decision route analysis, model compression, knowledge distillation, and more. The source codes are included in the \emph{Supplementary Material}.

Model Reconstruction Using Counterfactual Explanations: A Perspective From Polytope Theory
Counterfactual explanations provide ways of achieving a favorable model outcome with minimum input perturbation. However, counterfactual explanations can also be leveraged to reconstruct the model by strategically training a surrogate model to give similar predictions as the original (target) model. In this work, we analyze how model reconstruction using counterfactuals can be improved byfurther leveraging the fact that the counterfactuals also lie quite close to the decision boundary. Our main contribution is to derive novel theoretical relationships between the error in model reconstruction and the number of counterfactual queries required using polytope theory. Our theoretical analysis leads us to propose a strategy for model reconstruction that we call Counterfactual Clamping Attack (CCA) which trains a surrogate model using a unique loss function that treats counterfactuals differently than ordinary instances. Our approach also alleviates the related problem of decision boundary shift that arises in existing model reconstruction approaches when counterfactuals are treated as ordinary instances. Experimental results demonstrate that our strategy improves fidelity between the target and surrogate model predictions on several datasets.

Model Sensitivity Aware Continual Learning
Continual learning (CL) aims to adapt to non-stationary data distributions while retaining previously acquired knowledge. However, CL models typically face a trade-off between preserving old task knowledge and excelling in new task performance. Existing approaches often sacrifice one for the other. To overcome this limitation, orthogonal to existing approaches, we propose a novel perspective that views the CL model ability in preserving old knowledge and performing well in new task as a matter of model sensitivity to parameter updates. Excessive parameter sensitivity can lead to two drawbacks: (1) significant forgetting of previous knowledge; and (2) overfitting to new tasks.To reduce parameter sensitivity, we optimize the model's performance based on the parameter distribution, which achieves the worst-case CL performance within a distribution neighborhood. This innovative learning paradigm offers dual benefits: (1) reduced forgetting of old knowledge by mitigating drastic changes in model predictions under small parameter updates; and (2) enhanced new task performance by preventing overfitting to new tasks. Consequently, our method achieves superior ability in retaining old knowledge and achieving excellent new task performance simultaneously.Importantly, our approach is compatible with existing CL methodologies, allowing seamless integration while delivering significant improvements in effectiveness, efficiency, and versatility with both theoretical and empirical  support.

Molecule Design by Latent Prompt Transformer
Recent advancements in conditional generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality language and images based on prompts. These advancements can be extended to the challenging problem of molecule design by framing it as a conditional generative modeling task, with target biological properties or desired chemical constraints as conditioning variables.We propose the Latent Prompt Transformer (LPT) model, a novel generative model comprising three components: (1) a latent vector with a learnable prior distribution modeled by a neural transformation of a Gaussian white noise; (2) a molecule generation model using a causal Transformer with the latent vector as a prompt; and (3) a property prediction model that predicts a molecule's target property value based on the latent prompt. LPT can be learned by maximum likelihood estimation on molecule-property pairs. During property optimization, the latent prompt is inferred from expected property and constraints via posterior sampling and then guides the autoregressive molecule generation.After initial training on existing molecules and their properties, we progressively shift the model distribution towards regions supporting desired target properties. Experiments show that LPT effectively discovers useful molecules in single-objective, multi-objective, and structure-constrained optimization tasks.

MoMu-Diffusion: On Learning Long-Term Motion-Music Synchronization and Correspondence
Motion-to-music and music-to-motion have been studied separately, each attracting substantial research interest within their respective domains. The interaction between human motion and music is a reflection of advanced human intelligence, and establishing a unified relationship between them is particularly important. However, to date, there has been no work that considers them jointly to explore the modality alignment within. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework, termed MoMu-Diffusion, for long-term and synchronous motion-music generation. Firstly, to mitigate the huge computational costs raised by long sequences, we propose a novel Bidirectional Contrastive Rhythmic Variational Auto-Encoder (BiCoR-VAE) that extracts the modality-aligned latent representations for both motion and music inputs. Subsequently, leveraging the aligned latent spaces, we introduce a multi-modal diffusion Transformer model and a cross-guidance sampling strategy to enable various generation tasks, including cross-modal, multi-modal, and variable-length generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoMu-Diffusion surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, and can synthesize realistic, diverse, long-term, and beat-matched music or motion sequences. The generated motion-music samples are available at https://momu-diffusion.github.io/.

Monoculture in Matching Markets
Algorithmic monoculture arises when many decision-makers rely on the same algorithm to evaluate applicants. An emerging body of work investigates possible harms of this kind of homogeneity, but has been limited by the challenge of incorporating market effects in which the preferences and behavior of many applicants and decision-makers jointly interact to determine outcomes.Addressing this challenge, we introduce a tractable theoretical model of algorithmic monoculture in a two-sided matching market with many participants. We use the model to analyze outcomes under monoculture (when decision-makers all evaluate applicants using a common algorithm) and under polyculture (when decision-makers evaluate applicants independently). All else equal, monoculture (1) selects less-preferred applicants when noise is well-behaved, (2) matches more applicants to their top choice, though individual applicants may be worse off depending on their value to decision-makers and risk tolerance, and (3) is more robust to disparities in the number of applications submitted.

Monomial Matrix Group Equivariant Neural Functional Networks
Neural functional networks (NFNs) have recently gained significant attention due to their diverse applications, ranging from predicting network generalization and network editing to classifying implicit neural representation. Previous NFN designs often depend on permutation symmetries in neural networks' weights, which traditionally arise from the unordered arrangement of neurons in hidden layers. However, these designs do not take into account the weight scaling symmetries of ReLU networks, and the weight sign flipping symmetries of sin or Tanh networks. In this paper, we extend the study of the group action on the network weights from the group of permutation matrices to the group of monomial matrices by incorporating scaling/sign-flipping symmetries. Particularly, we encode these scaling/sign-flipping symmetries by designing our corresponding equivariant and invariant layers. We name our new family of NFNs the Monomial Matrix Group Equivariant Neural Functional Networks (Monomial-NFN). Because of the expansion of the symmetries, Monomial-NFN has much fewer independent trainable parameters compared to the baseline NFNs in the literature, thus enhancing the model's efficiency. Moreover, for fully connected and convolutional neural networks, we theoretically prove that all groups that leave these networks invariant while acting on their weight spaces are some subgroups of the monomial matrix group. We provide empirical evidences to demonstrate the advantages of our model over existing baselines, achieving competitive performance and efficiency.

Monte Carlo Tree Search based Space Transfer for Black Box Optimization
Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular method for computationally expensive black-box optimization (BBO) problems. However, traditional BO methods need to solve new problems from scratch, leading to slow convergence. Recent studies try to extend BO to a transfer learning setup to speed up the optimization, where search space transfer is one of the most promising approaches and has shown impressive performance on many tasks. However, existing search space transfer methods either lack an adaptive mechanism or are not flexible enough, making it difficult to efficiently identify promising search space during the optimization process. In this paper, we propose a search space transfer learning method based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), called MCTS-transfer, to iteratively divide, select, and optimize in a learned subspace. MCTS-transfer can not only provide a well-performing search space for warm-start but also adaptively identify and leverage the information of similar source tasks to reconstruct the search space during the optimization process. Experiments on synthetic functions, real-world problems and hyper-parameter optimization show that MCTS-transfer can demonstrate superior performance compared to other search space transfer methods under different settings.

MOTE-NAS: Multi-Objective Training-based Estimate for Efficient Neural Architecture Search
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods seek effective optimization toward performance metrics regarding model accuracy and generalization while facing challenges regarding search costs and GPU resources. Recent Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) NAS methods achieve remarkable search efficiency based on a training-free model estimate; however, they overlook the non-convex nature of the DNNs in the search process. In this paper, we develop Multi-Objective Training-based Estimate (MOTE) for efficient NAS, retaining search effectiveness and achieving the new state-of-the-art in the accuracy and cost trade-off. To improve NTK and inspired by the Training Speed Estimation (TSE) method, MOTE is designed to model the actual performance of DNNs from macro to micro perspective by draw loss landscape and convergence speed simultaneously. Using two reduction strategies, the MOTE is generated based on a reduced architecture and a reduced dataset. Inspired by evolutionary search, our iterative ranking-based, coarse-to-fine architecture search is highly effective. Experiments on NASBench-201 show MOTE-NAS achieves 94.32% accuracy on CIFAR-10, 72.81% on CIFAR-100, and 46.38% on ImageNet-16-120, outperforming NTK-based NAS approaches. An evaluation-free (EF) version of MOTE-NAS delivers high efficiency in only 5 minutes, delivering a model more accurate than KNAS.

MOTI$\mathcal{V}\mathcal{E}$: A Drug-Target Interaction Graph For Inductive Link Prediction
Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is crucial for identifying newtherapeutics and detecting mechanisms of action. While structure-based methodsaccurately model physical interactions between a drug and its protein target,cell-based assays such as Cell Painting can better capture complex DTIinteractions. This paper introduces MOTI$\mathcal{V}\mathcal{E}$, a MorphologicalcOmpound Target Interaction Graph datasetthat comprises Cell Painting features for $11,000$ genes and $3,600$ compoundsalong with their relationships extracted from seven publicly availabledatabases. We provide random, cold-source (new drugs), and cold-target (newgenes) data splits to enable rigorous evaluation under realistic use cases. Ourbenchmark results show that graph neural networks that use Cell Paintingfeatures consistently outperform those that learn from graph structure alone,feature-based models, and topological heuristics. MOTI$\mathcal{V}\mathcal{E}$accelerates both graph ML research and drug discovery by promoting thedevelopment of more reliable DTI prediction models. MOTI$\mathcal{V}\mathcal{E}$ resources areavailable at https://github.com/carpenter-singh-lab/motive.

Motif-oriented influence maximization for viral marketing in large-scale social networks
The \emph{influence maximization (IM)} problem aims to identify a budget set of nodes with the highest potential to influence the largest number of users in a given cascade model in the viral marketing. In the traditional \emph{IM}, each user/node is considered independently as a potential target customer. However, in many scenarios, the target customers are motifs, and activating only one (or a few) users within a motif is useless in viral marketing, which, nevertheless, receives little attention. For example, if a motif of three friends plan to dine together, it is essential that all three users are targeted simultaneously for the restaurant advertisement to be successful.In this paper, we investigate the motif-oriented influence maximization problem under the linear threshold model. We demonstrate that the motif-oriented IM problem is NP-hard and the influence function exhibits neither supermodular nor submodular properties, in contrast to the submodular property in the classical \emph{IM} setting.To simplify the problem, we establish the submodular upper and lower bounds for the influence function. Leveraging the submodular property, we propose a natural greedy strategy that could maximize the upper and lower bounds simultaneously. Our algorithm has an approximation ratio of  $\tau\cdot (1-1/e-\varepsilon)$ and a near-linear time complexity of $O((k+l)(m+\eta)\log \eta/\varepsilon^2)$.We conduct experiments on diverse datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in terms of motif maximization.

Motion Consistency Model: Accelerating Video Diffusion with Disentangled Motion-Appearance Distillation
Image diffusion distillation achieves high-fidelity generation with very few sampling steps. However, directly applying these techniques to video models results in unsatisfied frame quality. This issue arises from the limited frame appearance quality in public video datasets, affecting the performance of both teacher and student video diffusion models. Our study aims to improve video diffusion distillation and meanwhile enabling the student model to improve frame appearance using the abundant high-quality image data. To this end, we propose motion consistency models (MCM), a single-stage video diffusion distillation method that disentangles motion and appearance learning. Specifically, MCM involves a video consistency model that distills motion from the video teacher model, and an image discriminator that boosts frame appearance to match high-quality image data. However, directly combining these components leads to two significant challenges: a conflict in frame learning objectives, where video distillation learns from low-quality video frames while the image discriminator targets high-quality images, and training-inference discrepancies due to the differing quality of video samples used during training and inference. To address these challenges, we introduce disentangled motion distillation and mixed trajectory distillation. The former applies the distillation objective solely to the motion representation, while the latter mitigates training-inference discrepancies by mixing distillation trajectories from both the low- and high-quality video domains. Extensive experiments show that our MCM achieves state-of-the-art video diffusion distillation performance. Additionally, our method can enhance frame quality in video diffusion models, producing frames with high aesthetic value or specific styles.

MotionCraft: Physics-Based Zero-Shot Video Generation
Generating videos with realistic and physically plausible motion is one of the main recent challenges in computer vision. While diffusion models are achieving compelling results in image generation, video diffusion models are limited by heavy training and huge models, resulting in videos that are still biased to the training dataset. In this work we propose MotionCraft, a new zero-shot video generator to craft physics-based and realistic videos. MotionCraft is able to warp the noise latent space of an image diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion, by applying an optical flow derived from a physics simulation. We show that warping the noise latent space results in coherent application of the desired motion while allowing the model to generate missing elements consistent with the scene evolution, which would otherwise result in artefacts or missing content if the flow was applied in the pixel space.We compare our method with the state-of-the-art Text2Video-Zero reporting qualitative and quantitative improvements, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach to generate videos with finely-prescribed complex motion dynamics.

Multi-Agent Coordination via Multi-Level Communication
The partial observability and stochasticity in multi-agent settings can be mitigated by accessing more information about others via communication. However, the coordination problem still exists since agents cannot communicate actual actions with each other at the same time due to the circular dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level communication scheme, Sequential Communication (SeqComm). SeqComm treats agents asynchronously (the upper-level agents make decisions before the lower-level ones) and has two communication phases. In the negotiation phase, agents determine the priority of decision-making by communicating hidden states of observations and comparing the value of intention, which is obtained by modeling the environment dynamics. In the launching phase, the upper-level agents take the lead in making decisions and then communicate their actions with the lower-level agents. Theoretically, we prove the policies learned by SeqComm are guaranteed to improve monotonically and converge. Empirically, we show that SeqComm outperforms existing methods in a variety of cooperative multi-agent tasks.

Multi-Agent Imitation Learning: Value is Easy, Regret is Hard
We study a multi-agent imitation learning (MAIL) problem where we take the perspective of a learner attempting to coordinate a group of agents in a Markov Game by recommending actions based on demonstrations of an expert doing so. Most prior work in MAIL essentially reduces the problem to matching the behavior of the expert *within* the support of the demonstrations. While doing so is sufficient to drive the *value gap* between the learner and the expert to zero under the assumption that agents are non-strategic, it does not guarantee robustness to deviations by strategic agents. Intuitively, this is because strategic deviations can depend on a counterfactual quantity: the coordinator's recommendations outside of the state distribution their recommendations induce. In response, we initiate the study of an alternative objective for MAIL in Markov Games we term the *regret gap* that explicitly accounts for potential deviations by agents in the group. We first perform an in-depth exploration of the relationship between the value and regret gaps. First, we show that while the value gap can be efficiently minimized via a direct extension of single-agent IL algorithms, even *value equivalence* can lead to an arbitrarily large regret gap. This implies that achieving regret equivalence is harder than achieving value equivalence in MAIL. We then provide a pair of efficient reductions to no-regret online convex optimization that are capable of minimizing the regret gap *(a)* under a coverage assumption on the expert (MALICE) or *(b)* with access to a queryable expert (BLADES).

Multidimensional Fractional Programming for Normalized Cuts
The Normalized cut (NCut) problem is a fundamental and yet notoriously difficult one in the unsupervised clustering field. Because the NCut problem is fractionally structured, the fractional programming (FP) based approach has worked its way into a new frontier. However, the conventional FP techniques are insufficient: the classic Dinkelbach's transform can only deal with a single ratio and hence is limited to the two-class clustering, while the state-of-the-art quadratic transform accounts for multiple ratios but fails to convert the NCut problem to a tractable form. This work advocates a novel extension of the quadratic transform to the multidimensional ratio case, thereby recasting the fractional 0-1 NCut problem into a bipartite matching problem---which can be readily solved in an iterative manner. Furthermore, we explore the connection between the proposed multidimensional FP method and the minorization-maximization theory to verify the convergence.

Multi-Instance Partial-Label Learning with Margin Adjustment
Multi-instance partial-label learning (MIPL) is an emerging learning framework where each training sample is represented as a multi-instance bag associated with a candidate label set. Existing MIPL algorithms often overlook the margins for attention scores and predicted probabilities, leading to suboptimal generalization performance. A critical issue with these algorithms is that the highest prediction probability of the classifier may appear on a non-candidate label. In this paper, we propose an algorithm named MIPLMA, i.e., Multi-Instance Partial-Label learning with dual Margin Adjustment, which adjusts the margins for attention scores and predicted probabilities. We introduce a margin-aware attention mechanism to dynamically adjust the margins for attention scores and propose a margin-compliant loss to constrain the margins between the predicted probabilities on candidate and non-candidate label sets. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MIPLMA over existing MIPL algorithms, as well as other well-established multi-instance learning algorithms and partial-label learning algorithms. The source code of MIPLMA is included in the supplementary material and will be publicly accessible.

Multi-Label Learning with Stronger Consistency Guarantees
We present a detailed study of surrogate losses and algorithms for multi-label learning, supported by $H$-consistency bounds. We first show that, for the simplest form of multi-label loss (the popular Hamming loss), the well-known consistent binary relevance surrogate suffers from a sub-optimal dependency on the number of labels in terms of $H$-consistency bounds, when using smooth losses such as logistic losses. Furthermore, this loss function fails to account for label correlations. To address these drawbacks, we introduce a novel surrogate loss, *multi-label logistic loss*,  that accounts for label correlations and benefits from label-independent $H$-consistency bounds. We then broaden our analysis to cover a more extensive family of multi-label losses, including all common ones and a new extension defined based on linear-fractional functions with respect to the confusion matrix. We also extend our multi-label logistic losses to more comprehensive multi-label comp-sum losses, adapting comp-sum losses from standard classification to the multi-label learning. We prove that this family of surrogate losses benefits from $H$-consistency bounds, and thus Bayes-consistency, across any general multi-label loss. Our work thus proposes a unified surrogate loss framework benefiting from strong consistency guarantees for any multi-label loss, significantly expanding upon previous work which only established Bayes-consistency and for specific loss functions. Additionally, we adapt constrained losses from standard classification to multi-label constrained losses in a similar way, which also benefit from $H$-consistency bounds and thus Bayes-consistency for any multi-label loss. We further describe efficient gradient computation algorithms for minimizing the multi-label logistic loss.

Multimodal Conformal Prediction in Dynamic Environments
Conformal prediction is an uncertainty quantification method that constructs a prediction set for a previously unseen datum, ensuring the true label is included with a predetermined coverage probability. Adaptive conformal prediction has been developed to address data distribution shifts in dynamic environments. However, the efficiency of prediction sets varies depending on the learning model used. Employing a single fixed model may not consistently offer the best performance in dynamic environments with unknown data distribution shifts. To address this issue, we introduce a novel adaptive conformal prediction framework, where the model used for creating prediction sets is selected ‘on the fly’ from multiple candidate models. The proposed algorithm is proven to achieve strongly adaptive regret over all intervals while maintaining valid coverage. Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets corroborate that the proposed approach consistently yields more efficient prediction sets while maintaining valid coverage, outperforming alternative methods.

Multistable Shape from Shading Emerges from Patch Diffusion
Models for monocular shape reconstruction of surfaces with diffuse reflection---shape from shading---ought to produce distributions of outputs, because there are fundamental mathematical ambiguities of both continuous (e.g., bas-relief) and discrete (e.g., convex/concave) varieties which are also experienced by humans. Yet, the outputs of current models are limited to point estimates or tight distributions around single modes, which prevent them from capturing these effects. We introduce a model that reconstructs a multimodal distribution of shapes from a single shading image, which aligns with the human experience of multistable perception. We train a small denoising diffusion process to generate surface normal fields from $16\times 16$ patches of synthetic images of everyday 3D objects. We deploy this model patch-wise at multiple scales, with guidance from inter-patch shape consistency constraints. Despite its relatively small parameter count and predominantly bottom-up structure, we show that multistable shape explanations emerge from this model for ``ambiguous'' test images that humans experience as being multistable. At the same time, the model produces veridical shape estimates for object-like images that include distinctive occluding contours and appear less ambiguous. This may inspire new architectures for stochastic 3D shape perception that are more efficient and better aligned with human experience.

Multi-Stage Predict+Optimize for (Mixed Integer) Linear Programs
The recently-proposed framework of Predict+Optimize tackles optimization problems with parameters that are unknown at solving time, in a supervised learning setting. Prior frameworks consider only the scenario where all unknown parameters are (eventually) revealed simultaneously. In this work, we propose Multi-Stage Predict+Optimize, a novel extension catering to applications where unknown parameters are revealed in sequential stages, with optimization decisions made in between. We further develop three training algorithms for neural networks (NNs) for our framework as proof of concept, both of which handle all mixed integer linear programs. The first baseline algorithm is a natural extension of prior work, training a single NN which makes a single prediction of unknown parameters. The second and third algorithms instead leverage the possibility of updating parameter predictions between stages, and trains one NN per stage. To handle the interdependency between the neural networks, we adopt sequential and parallelized versions of coordinate descent for training. Experimentation on three benchmarks demonstrates the superior learning performance of our methods over classical approaches.

Multistep Distillation of Diffusion Models via Moment Matching
We present a new method for making diffusion models faster to sample. The method distills many-step diffusion models into few-step models by matching conditional expectations of the clean data given noisy data along the sampling trajectory. Our approach extends recently proposed one-step methods to the multi-step case, and provides a new perspective by interpreting these approaches in terms of moment matching. By using up to 8 sampling steps, we obtain distilled models that outperform not only their one-step versions but also their original many-step teacher models, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on the Imagenet dataset. We also show promising results on a large text-to-image model where we achieve fast generation of high resolution images directly in image space, without needing autoencoders or upsamplers.

Multi-times Monte Carlo Rendering for Inter-reflection Reconstruction
Inverse rendering methods have achieved remarkable performance in reconstructing high-fidelity 3D objects with disentangled geometries, materials, and environmental light. However, they still face huge challenges in reflective surface reconstruction. Although recent methods model the light trace to learn specularity, the ignorance of indirect illumination makes it hard to handle inter-reflections among multiple smooth objects. In this work, we propose Ref-MC2 that introduces the multi-time Monte Carlo sampling which comprehensively computes the environmental illumination and meanwhile considers the reflective light from object surfaces. To address the computation challenge as the times of Monte Carlo sampling grow, we propose a specularity-adaptive sampling strategy, significantly reducing the computational complexity. Besides the computational resource, higher geometry accuracy is also required because geometric errors accumulate multiple times. Therefore, we further introduce a reflection-aware surface model to initialize the geometry and refine it during inverse rendering. We construct a challenging dataset containing scenes with multiple objects and inter-reflections. Experiments show that our method outperforms other inverse rendering methods on various object groups. We also show downstream applications, e.g., relighting and material editing, to illustrate the disentanglement ability of our method.

Multivariate Stochastic Dominance via Optimal Transport and Applications to Models Benchmarking
Stochastic dominance is an important concept in probability theory, econometrics and social choice theory for robustly modeling agents' preferences between random outcomes.  While many works have been dedicated to the univariate case,little has been done in the multivariate scenario, wherein an agent has to decide between different multivariate outcomes. By exploiting a  characterization  of  multivariate first stochastic dominance in terms of couplings, we  introduce  a statistic that assesses multivariate almost stochastic dominance under the framework of Optimal Transport  with a smooth cost. Further, we introduce an entropic regularization of this statistic, and establish a central limit theorem (CLT) and consistency of the bootstrap procedure for the empirical statistic. Armed with this CLT, we propose a hypothesis testing framework as well as an efficient implementation using the Sinkhorn algorithm. We showcase our  method in comparing and benchmarking Large Language Models that are evaluated on multiple metrics. Our multivariate stochastic dominance test allows us to capture the dependencies between the metrics in order to make an informed and statistically significant  decision on the relative performance of the models.

Multiview Scene Graph
A proper scene representation is central to the pursuit of spatial intelligence where agents can robustly reconstruct and efficiently understand 3D scenes. A scene representation is either metric, such as landmark maps in 3D reconstruction, 3D bounding boxes in object detection, or voxel grids in occupancy prediction, or topological, such as pose graphs with loop closures in SLAM or visibility graphs in SfM.  In this work, we propose to build Multiview Scene Graphs (MSG) from unposed images, representing a scene topologically with interconnected place and object nodes.   The task of building MSG is challenging for existing representation learning methods since it needs to jointly address both visual place recognition, object detection, and object association from images with limited fields of view and potentially large viewpoint changes.  To evaluate any method tackling this task, we developed an MSG dataset and annotation based on a public 3D dataset.  We also propose an evaluation metric based on the intersection-over-union score of MSG edges.   Moreover, we develop a novel baseline method built on mainstream pretrained vision models, combining visual place recognition and object association into one Transformer decoder architecture.   Experiments demonstrate our method has superior performance compared to existing relevant baselines.

Mutual Information Estimation via Normalizing Flows
We propose a novel approach to the problem of mutual information (MI) estimation via introducing a family of estimators based on normalizing flows. The estimator maps original data to the target distribution, for which MI is easier to estimate. We additionally explore the target distributions with known closed-form expressions for MI. Theoretical guarantees are provided to demonstrate that our approach yields MI estimates for the original data. Experiments with high-dimensional data are conducted to highlight the practical advantages of the proposed method.

MUVERA: Multi-Vector Retrieval via Fixed Dimensional Encoding
Neural embedding models have become a fundamental component of modern information retrieval (IR) pipelines. These models produce a single embedding $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ per data-point, allowing for fast retrieval via highly optimized maximum inner product search (MIPS) algorithms. Recently, beginning with the landmark ColBERT paper, multi-vector models, which produce a set of embedding per data point, have achieved markedly superior performance for IR tasks. Unfortunately, using these models for IR is computationally expensive due to the increased complexity of multi-vector retrieval and scoring. In this paper, we introduce MUVERA (MUlti-VEctor Retrieval Algorithm), a retrieval mechanism which reduces multi-vector similarity search to single-vector similarity search. This enables the usage of off-the-shelf MIPS solvers for multi-vector retrieval. MUVERA asymmetrically generates Fixed Dimensional Encodings (FDEs) of queries and documents, which are vectors whose inner product approximates multi-vector similarity. We prove that FDEs give high-quality $\epsilon$-approximations, thus providing the first single-vector proxy for multi-vector similarity with theoretical guarantees. Empirically, we find that FDEs achieve the same recall as prior state-of-the-art heuristics while retrieving 2-5$\times$ fewer candidates. Compared to prior state of the art implementations, MUVERA achieves consistently good end-to-end recall and latency across a diverse set of the BEIR retrieval datasets, achieving an average of 10% improved recall with 90% lower latency.

MVGamba: Unify 3D Content Generation as State Space Sequence Modeling
Recent 3D large reconstruction models (LRMs) can generate high-quality 3D content in sub-seconds by integrating multi-view diffusion models with scalable multi-view reconstructors. Current works further leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting as 3D representation for improved visual quality and rendering efficiency. However, we observe that existing Gaussian reconstruction models often suffer from multi-view inconsistency and blurred textures. We attribute this to the compromise of multi-view information propagation in favor of adopting powerful yet computationally intensive architectures (e.g., Transformers). To address this issue, we introduce MVGamba, a general and lightweight Gaussian reconstruction model featuring a multi-view Gaussian reconstructor based on the RNN-like State Space Model (SSM). Our Gaussian reconstructor propagates causal context containing multi-view information for cross-view self-refinement while generating a long sequence of Gaussians for fine-detail modeling with linear complexity.With off-the-shelf multi-view diffusion models integrated, MVGamba unifies 3D generation tasks from a single image, sparse images, or text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVGamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in all 3D content generation scenarios with approximately only 0.1x of the model size.

MVSplat360: Benchmarking 360$\textdegree$ Generalizable 3D Novel View Synthesis from Sparse Views
We introduce MVSplat360, a feed-forward approach for 360$\textdegree$ novel view synthesis (NVS) in wild scene scenarios given only sparse observations. This task of generalizable 360$\textdegree$ scene reconstruction from sparse views is challenging and ill-posed. Existing methods fail to achieve plausible 360$\textdegree$ scene reconstruction from such sparse observations due to insufficient information to recover the entire scene and the minimal overlap between given views. Therefore, our MVSplat360 takes an initial step toward addressing these challenges, which first matches and fuses view information through a cross-view transformer encoder, then constructs a coarse 3D geometry using the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting, and finally refines invisible and inconsistent appearances with a pre-trained stable video diffusion model. We construct a new benchmark using the challenging DL3DV dataset, where MVSplat360 significantly outperforms prior works in wide-sweeping and even 360$\textdegree$ NVS from sparse image observations. We also conduct extensive comparisons on the existing RealEstate10K benchmark, further demonstrating the efficacy of our method.

NaRCan: Natural Refined Canonical Image with Integration of Diffusion Prior for Video Editing
Video editing approaches, especially through image-based diffusion models, have seen significant advancements but struggle with temporal consistency in video-to-video tasks. Existing models often fail to maintain sequence temporal consistency, disrupting frame transitions. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces NaRCan, a video editing framework that integrates a hybrid deformation field network with diffusion priors. Unlike conventional methods that generate a canonical image as a singular representation of video content, our approach ensures the production of high-quality, natural canonical images, which are crucial for downstream tasks like handwriting, style transfer, and dynamic segmentation. By leveraging a hybrid deformation field module and a sophisticated-designed scheduling method, NaRCan offers improved adaptability and superior editing capabilities across various video editing applications. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches in producing coherent and high-quality video sequences. This work advances the state of video editing approaches and provides a robust solution for maintaining sequence temporal consistency using diffusion-based methods.

Natural Counterfactuals With Necessary Backtracking
Counterfactual reasoning is pivotal in human cognition and especially important for providing explanations and making decisions. While Judea Pearl's influential approach is theoretically elegant, its generation of a counterfactual scenario often requires too much deviation from the observed scenarios to be feasible, as we show using simple examples. To mitigate this difficulty, we propose a framework of *natural counterfactuals* and a method for generating counterfactuals that are more feasible with respect to the actual data distribution. Our methodology incorporates a certain amount of backtracking when needed, allowing changes in causally preceding variables to minimize deviations from realistic scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a novel optimization framework that permits but also controls the extent of backtracking with a ``naturalness'' criterion. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Navigable Graphs for High-Dimensional Nearest Neighbor Search: Constructions and Limits
There has been recent interest in graph-based nearest neighbor search methods, many of which are centered on the construction (approximately) "navigable" graphs over high-dimensional point sets. A graph is navigable if greedy routing successfully routes from any starting node to any target node. The complete graph is navigable for any point set, but the important question for applications is if sparser graphs can be constructed. While this question is well understood in low-dimensions, we establish some of the first upper and lower bounds for high-dimensional point sets. First, we give a simple and efficient way to construct a navigable graph with average degree $O(\sqrt{n \log n })$ for any set of $n$ points, in any dimension, for any distance function. We compliment this result with a nearly matching lower bound: even under the Euclidean metric in $O(\log n)$ dimensions, a random point set has no navigable graph with average degree $O(n^{\alpha})$  for any $\alpha < 1/2$. Our lower bound relies on sharp anti-concentration bounds for binomial random variables, which we use to show that the {near-neighborhoods} of a set of random points do not overlap significantly, forcing any navigable graph to have many edges.

Navigating Extremes: Dynamic Sparsity in Large Output Spaces
In recent years, Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) has emerged as an alternative to post-training pruning for generating efficient models. In principle, DST allows for a much more memory efficient training process,as it maintains sparsity throughout the entire training run. However, current DST implementations fail to capitalize on this. Because sparse matrix multiplication is much less efficient than dense matrix multiplication on GPUs, mostimplementations simulate sparsity by masking weights. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in semi-structured sparse training to apply DST in the domain of classificationwith large output spaces, where memory-efficiency is paramount. With a label space of possibly millions of candidates,the classification layer alone will consume several gigabytes of memory. Switching from a dense to a fixed fan-in sparse layer updated with sparse evolutionary training (SET); however, severely hampers training convergence, especiallyat the largest label spaces. We find that the gradients fed back from the classifier into the text encoder make itmuch more difficult to learn good input representations, despite using a dense encoder.By employing an intermediate layer or adding an auxiliary training objective, we recover most of the generalisation performance of the dense model. Overall, we demonstrate the applicability of DST in a challenging domain, characterized by a highly skewed label distribution, that lies outside of DST's typical benchmark datasets, and enable end-to-end training with millions of labels on commodity hardware.

Navigating the Effect of Parametrization for Dimensionality Reduction
Parametric dimensionality reduction methods have gained prominence for their ability to generalize to unseen datasets, an advantage that traditional non-parametric approaches typically lack. Despite their growing popularity, there remains a prevalent misconception among practitioners about the equivalence in performance between parametric and non-parametric methods. Here, we show that these methods are not equivalent -- parametric methods retain global structure but lose significant local details. To explain this, we provide evidence that parameterized approaches lack the ability to repulse negative samples, and the choice of loss function also has an impact.To address these issues, we developed a new parametric method, ParamRepulsor, that incorporates Hard Negative Mining and a loss function that applies a strong repulsive force. This new method achieves state-of-the-art performance on local structure preservation for parametric methods without sacrificing the fidelity of global structural representation.

Navigating the Maze of Explainable AI: A Systematic Approach to Evaluating Methods and Metrics
Explainable AI (XAI) is a rapidly growing domain with a myriad of proposed methods as well as metrics aiming to evaluate their efficacy. However, current studies are often of limited scope, examining only a handful of XAI methods and ignoring underlying design parameters for performance, such as the model architecture or the nature of input data.  Moreover, they often rely on one or a few metrics and neglect thorough validation, increasing the risk of selection bias and ignoring discrepancies among metrics. These shortcomings leave practitioners confused about which method to choose for their problem. In response, we introduce LATEC, a large-scale benchmark that critically evaluates 17 prominent XAI methods using 20 distinct metrics.  We systematically incorporate vital design parameters like varied architectures and diverse input modalities, resulting in 7,560 examined combinations.  Through LATEC, we showcase the high risk of conflicting metrics leading to unreliable rankings and consequently propose a more robust evaluation scheme. Further, we comprehensively evaluate various XAI methods to assist practitioners in selecting appropriate methods aligning with their needs. Curiously, the emerging top-performing method, Expected Gradients, is not examined in any relevant related study. LATEC reinforces its role in future XAI research by publicly releasing all 326k saliency maps and 378k metric scores as a (meta-)evaluation dataset. The benchmark is hosted at: https://github.com/kjdhfg/LATEC.

Nearly Minimax Optimal Submodular Maximization with Bandit Feedback
We consider maximizing an unknown monotonic, submodular set function $f: 2^{[n]} \rightarrow [0,1]$ with cardinality constraint under stochastic bandit feedback.     At each time $t=1,\dots,T$ the learner chooses a set $S_t \subset [n]$ with $|S_t| \leq k$ and receives reward $f(S_t) + \eta_t$ where $\eta_t$ is mean-zero sub-Gaussian noise.     The objective is to minimize the learner's regret with respect to an approximation of the maximum $f(S_*)$ with $|S_*| = k$, obtained through robust greedy maximization of $f$.     To date, the best regret bound in the literature scales as $k n^{1/3} T^{2/3}$.     And by trivially treating every set as a unique arm one deduces that $\sqrt{ {n \choose k} T }$ is also achievable using standard multi-armed bandit algorithms.     In this work, we establish the first minimax lower bound for this setting that scales like $\tilde{\Omega}(\min_{L \le k}(L^{1/3}n^{1/3}T^{2/3} + \sqrt{{n \choose k - L}T}))$.  For a slightly restricted algorithm class, we prove, we prove a stronger regret lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(\min_{L \le k}(Ln^{1/3}T^{2/3} + \sqrt{{n \choose k - L}T}))$.    Moreover, we propose an algorithm Sub-UCB that achieves regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\min_{L \le k}(Ln^{1/3}T^{2/3} + \sqrt{{n \choose k - L}T}))$ capable of matching the lower bound on regret for the restricted class up to logarithmic factors.

Near-Optimal Approximation of Matrix Functions by the Lanczos Method
Approximating the action of a matrix function $f(\vec{A})$ on a vector $\vec{b}$ is an increasingly important primitive in machine learning, data science, and statistics, with applications such as sampling high dimensional Gaussians, Gaussian process regression and Bayesian inference, principle component analysis, and approximating Hessian spectral densities.Over the past decade, a number of algorithms enjoying strong theoretical guarantees have been proposed for this task.Many of the most successful belong to a family of algorithms called Krylov subspace methods.Remarkably, a classic Krylov subspace method, called the Lanczos method for matrix functions (Lanczos-FA), frequently outperforms newer methods in practice. Our main result is a theoretical justification for this finding: we show that, for a natural class of rational functions, Lanczos-FA matches the error of the best possible Krylov subspace method up to a multiplicative approximation factor. The approximation factor depends on the degree of $f(x)$'s denominator and the condition number of $\vec{A}$, but not on the number of iterations $k$. Our result provides a strong justification for the excellent performance of Lanczos-FA, especially on functions that are well approximated by rationals, such as the matrix square root.

Near-Optimal Distributed Minimax Optimization under the Second-Order Similarity
This paper considers the distributed convex-concave minimax optimization under the second-order similarity.We propose stochastic variance-reduced optimistic gradient sliding (SVOGS) method, which takes the advantage of the finite-sum structure in the objective by involving the mini-batch client sampling and variance reduction.We prove SVOGS can achieve the $\varepsilon$-duality gap within communication rounds of ${\mathcal O}(\delta D^2/\varepsilon)$, communication complexity of ${\mathcal O}(n+\sqrt{n}\delta D^2/\varepsilon)$,and local gradient calls of $\tilde{\mathcal O}(n+(\sqrt{n}\delta+L)D^2/\varepsilon\log(1/\varepsilon))$, where $n$ is the number of nodes, $\delta$ is the degree of the second-order similarity, $L$ is the smoothness parameter and $D$ is the diameter of the constraint set.We can verify that all of above complexity (nearly) matches the corresponding lower bounds.For the specific $\mu$-strongly-convex-$\mu$-strongly-convex case, our algorithm has the upper bounds on communication rounds,  communication complexity, and local gradient calls of $\mathcal O(\delta/\mu\log(1/\varepsilon))$, ${\mathcal O}((n+\sqrt{n}\delta/\mu)\log(1/\varepsilon))$, and $\tilde{\mathcal O}(n+(\sqrt{n}\delta+L)/\mu)\log(1/\varepsilon))$ respectively, which are also nearly tight.Furthermore, we conduct the numerical experiments to show the empirical advantages of proposed method.

Near-Optimal Distributionally Robust RL with General $L_p$ Norms
To address the challenges of sim-to-real gap and sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL), this work studies distributionally robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) --- optimize the worst-case performance when the deployed environment is within an uncertainty set around some nominal MDP. Despite recent efforts, the sample complexity of RMDPs has remained largely undetermined. While the statistical implications of distributional robustness in RL have been explored in some specific cases, the generalizability of the existing findings remains unclear, especially in comparison to standard RL.  Assuming access to a generative model that samples from the nominal MDP, we examine the sample complexity of RMDPs using a class of generalized $L_p$ norms as the 'distance' function for the uncertainty set, under two commonly adopted $sa$-rectangular and $s$-rectangular conditions. Our results imply that RMDPs can be more sample-efficient to solve than standard MDPs using generalized $L_p$ norms in both $sa$- and $s$-rectangular cases, potentially inspiring more empirical research. We provide a near-optimal upper bound and a matching minimax lower bound for the $sa$-rectangular scenarios. For $s$-rectangular cases, we improve the state-of-the-art upper bound and also derive a lower bound using $L_\infty$ norm that verifies the tightness.

Near-Optimality of Contrastive Divergence Algorithms
We provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the contrastive divergence (CD) algorithm, a training method for unnormalized models. While prior work has established that (for exponential family distributions) the CD iterates asymptotically converge at an $O(n^{-1 / 3})$ rate to the true parameter of the data distribution, we show that CD can achieve the parametric rate $O(n^{-1 / 2})$. Our analysis provides results for various data batching schemes, including fully online and minibatch. We additionally show that CD is near-optimal, in the sense that its asymptotic variance is close to the Cramér-Rao lower bound.

Near-Optimal Streaming Heavy-Tailed Statistical Estimation with Clipped SGD
$\newcommand{\Tr}{\mathsf{Tr}}$We consider the problem of high-dimensional heavy-tailed statistical estimation in the streaming setting, which is much harder than the traditional batch setting due to memory constraints. We cast this problem as stochastic convex optimization with heavy tailed stochastic gradients, and prove that the widely used Clipped-SGD algorithm attains near-optimal sub-Gaussian statistical rates whenever the second moment of the stochastic gradient noise is finite. More precisely, with $T$ samples, we show that Clipped-SGD, for smooth and strongly convex objectives, achieves an error of $\sqrt{\frac{\Tr(\Sigma)+\sqrt{\Tr(\Sigma)\\|\Sigma\\|_2}\ln(\tfrac{\ln(T)}{\delta})}{T}}$ with probability $1-\delta$, where $\Sigma$ is the covariance of the clipped gradient. Note that the fluctuations (depending on $\tfrac{1}{\delta}$) are of lower order than the term $\Tr(\Sigma)$.This improves upon the current best rate of$\sqrt{\frac{\Tr(\Sigma)\ln(\tfrac{1}{\delta})}{T}}$ for Clipped-SGD, known \emph{only} for smooth and strongly convex objectives. Our results also extend to smooth convex and lipschitz convex objectives. Key to our result is a novel iterative refinement strategy for martingale concentration, improving upon the PAC-Bayes approach of \citet{catoni2018dimension}.

Neglected Hessian component explains mysteries in sharpness regularization
Recent work has shown that methods that regularize second order information like SAM can improve generalization in deep learning. Seemingly similar methods like weight noise and gradient penalties often fail to provide such benefits. We investigate this inconsistency and reveal its connection to the the structure of the Hessian of the loss. Specifically, its decomposition into the positive semi-definite Gauss-Newton matrix and an indefinite matrix, which we call the Nonlinear Modeling Error (NME) matrix. Previous studies have largely overlooked the significance of the NME in their analysis for various reasons. However, we provide empirical and theoretical evidence that the NME is important to the performance of gradient penalties and explains their sensitivity to activation functions. We also provide evidence that the difference in regularization performance between gradient penalties and weight noise can be explained by the NME. Our findings emphasize the necessity of considering the NME in both experimental design and theoretical analysis for sharpness regularization.

Nesterov acceleration despite very noisy gradients
We present a generalization of Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent algorithm. Our algorithm (AGNES) provably achieves acceleration for smooth convex and strongly convex minimization tasks with noisy gradient estimates if the noise intensity is proportional to the magnitude of the gradient at every point. Nesterov's method converges at an accelerated rate if the constant of proportionality is below 1, while AGNES accommodates any signal-to-noise ratio. The noise model is motivated by applications in overparametrized machine learning. AGNES requires only two parameters in convex and three in strongly convex minimization tasks, improving on existing methods. We further provide clear geometric interpretations and heuristics for the choice of parameters.

Neuc-MDS: Non-Euclidean Multidimensional Scaling Through Bilinear Forms
We introduce \textbf{N}on-\textbf{Euc}lidean-\textbf{MDS} (Neuc-MDS), which extends Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to generate outputs that can be non-Euclidean and non-metric. The main idea is to generalize the inner product to other symmetric bilinear forms to utilize the negative eigenvalues of dissimiliarity Gram matrices. Neuc-MDS efficiently optimizes the choice of (both positive and negative) eigenvalues of the dissimilarity Gram matrix to reduce STRESS, the sum of squared pairwise error. We provide an in-depth error analysis and proofs of the optimality in minimizing lower bounds of STRESS. We demonstrate Neuc-MDS's ability to address limitations of classical MDS raised by prior research, and test it on various synthetic and real-world datasets in comparison with both linear and non-linear dimension reduction methods.

Neur2BiLO: Neural Bilevel Optimization
Bilevel optimization deals with nested problems in which a leader takes the first decision to minimize their objective function while accounting for a follower best-response reaction. Constrained bilevel problems with integer variables are particularly notorious for their hardness. While exact solvers have been proposed for mixed-integer linear bilevel optimization, they tend to scale poorly with problem size and are hard to generalize to the non-linear case. On the other hand, problem-specific algorithms (exact and heuristic) are limited in scope. Under a data-driven setting in which similar instances of a bilevel problem are solved routinely, our proposed framework, Neur2BiLO, embeds a neural network approximation of the leader's or follower's value function, trained via supervised regression, into an easy-to-solve mixed-integer program. Neur2BiLO serves as a heuristic that produces high-quality solutions extremely fast for a variety of bilevel problems spanning linear/non-linear, integer/mixed-integer knapsack problems, and four application domains.

Neural Collapse Inspired Feature Alignment for Out-of-Distribution Generalization
The spurious correlation between the background features of the image and its label arises due to that the samples labeled with the same class in the training set often co-occurs with a specific background, which will cause the encoder to extract non-semantic features for classification, resulting in poor out-of-distribution generalization performance. Although many studies have been proposed to address this challenge, the semantic and spurious features are still difficult to accurately decouple from the original image and fail to achieve high performance with deep learning models. This paper proposes a novel perspective inspired by neural collapse to solve the spurious correlation problem through the alternate execution of environment partitioning and learning semantic masks. Specifically, we propose to assign an environment to each sample by learning a local model for each environment and using maximum likelihood probability. At the same time, we require that the learned semantic mask neurally collapses to the same simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) in each environment after being applied to the original input. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly improves out-of-distribution performance.

Neural Collapse to Multiple Centers For Imbalanced Data
Neural Collapse (NC) was a recently discovered phenomenon that the output features and the classifier weights of the neural network converge to optimal geometric structures at the Terminal Phase of Training (TPT) under various losses. However, the relationship between these optimal structures at TPT and the classification performance remains elusive, especially in imbalanced learning. Even though it is noticed that fixing the classifier to an optimal structure can mitigate the minority collapse problem, the performance is still not comparable to the classical imbalanced learning methods with a learnable classifier. In this work, we find that the optimal structure can be designed to represent a better classification rule, and thus achieve better performance. In particular, we justify that, to achieve better classification, the features from the minor classes should align with more directions.  This justification then yields a decision rule called the Generalized Classification Rule (GCR) and we also term these directions as the centers of the classes. Then we study the NC under an MSE-type loss via the Unconstrained Features Model (UFM) framework where (1) the features from a class tend to collapse to the mean of the corresponding centers of that class (named Neural Collapse to Multiple Centers (NCMC)) at the global optimum, and (2) the original classifier approximates a surrogate to GCR when NCMC occurs. Based on the analysis, we develop a strategy for determining the number of centers and propose a Cosine Loss function for the fixed classifier that induces NCMC. Our experiments have shown that the Cosine Loss can induce NCMC and has performance on long-tail classification comparable to the classical imbalanced learning methods.

Neural Combinatorial Optimization for Robust Routing Problem with Uncertain Travel Times
We consider the robust routing problem with uncertain travel times under the min-max regret criterion, which represents an extended and robust version of the classic traveling salesman problem (TSP) and vehicle routing problem (VRP). The general budget uncertainty set is employed to capture the uncertainty, which provides the capability to control the conservatism of obtained solutions and covers the commonly used interval uncertainty set as a special case. The goal is to obtain a robust solution that minimizes the maximum deviation from the optimal routing time in the worst-case scenario. Given the significant advancements and broad applications of neural combinatorial optimization methods in recent years, we present our initial attempt to combine neural approaches for solving this problem. We propose a dual multi-head cross attention mechanism to extract problem features represented by the inputted uncertainty sets. To tackle the built-in maximization problem, we derive the regret value by invoking a pre-trained model, subsequently utilizing it as the reward during the model training. Our experimental results on the robust TSP and VRP demonstrate the efficacy of our neural combinatorial optimization method, showcasing its ability to efficiently handle the robust routing problem of various sizes within a shorter time compared with alternative heuristic approaches.

Neural Concept Binder
The challenge in object-based visual reasoning lies in generating descriptive yet distinct concept representations. Moreover, doing this in an unsupervised fashion requires human users to understand a model’s learned concepts and potentially revise false concepts. In addressing this challenge, we introduce the Neural Concept Binder, a new framework for deriving discrete concept representations resulting in what we term “concept-slot encodings”. These encodings leverage both "soft binding" via object-centric block-slot encodings and "hard binding" via retrieval-based inference. The Neural Concept Binder facilitates straightforward concept inspection and direct integration of external knowledge, such as human input or insights from other AI models like GPT-4. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating the hard binding mechanism does not compromise performance; instead, it enables seamless integration into both neural and symbolic modules for intricate reasoning tasks, as evidenced by evaluations on our newly introduced CLEVR-Sudoku dataset.

Neural Conditional Probability for Inference
We introduce NCP (Neural Conditional Probability), a novel operator-theoretic approach for learning conditional distributions with a particular focus on inference tasks. NCP can be used to build conditional confidence regions and extract important statistics like conditional quantiles, mean, and covariance. It offers streamlined learning through a single unconditional training phase, facilitating efficient inference without the need for retraining even when conditioning changes. By tapping into the powerful approximation capabilities of neural networks, our method efficiently handles a wide variety of complex probability distributions, effectively dealing with nonlinear relationships between input and output variables. Theoretical guarantees ensure both optimization consistency and statistical accuracy of the NCP method.Our experiments show that our approach matches or beats leading methods using a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers and GELU activations. This demonstrates that a minimalistic architecture with a theoretically grounded loss function can achieve competitive results without sacrificing performance, even in the face of more complex architectures.

Neural Cover Selection for Image Steganography
In steganography, selecting an optimal cover image—referred to as cover selection—is pivotal for effective message concealment. Traditional methods have typically employed exhaustive searches to identify images that conform to specific perceptual or complexity metrics. However, the relationship between these metrics and the actual message hiding efficacy of an image is unclear, often yielding less-than-ideal steganographic outcomes. Inspired by recent advancements in generative models, we introduce a novel cover selection framework, which involves optimizing within the latent space of pretrained generative models to identify the most suitable cover images, distinguishing itself from traditional exhaustive search methods. Our method shows significant advantages in message recovery and image quality. We also conduct an information-theoretic analysis of the generated cover images, revealing that message hiding predominantly occurs in low-variance pixels, reflecting the waterfilling algorithm's principles in parallel Gaussian channels.

Neural Flow Diffusion Models: Learnable Forward Process for Improved Diffusion Modelling
Conventional diffusion models typically relies on a fixed forward process, which implicitly defines complex marginal distributions over latent variables. This can often complicate the reverse process’ task in learning generative trajectories, and results in costly inference for diffusion models. To address these limitations, we introduce Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM), a novel framework that enhances diffusion models by supporting a broader range of forward processes beyond the standard Gaussian. We also propose a novel parameterization technique for learning the forward process. Our framework provides an end-to-end, simulation-free optimization objective, effectively minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood. Experimental results demonstrate NFDM’s strong performance, evidenced by state-of-the-art likelihood estimation. Furthermore, we investigate NFDM’s capacity for learning generative dynamics with specific characteristics, such as deterministic straight lines trajectories, and demonstrate how the framework may be adopted for learning bridges between two distributions. The results underscores NFDM’s versatility and its potential for a wide range of applications.

Neural Gaffer: Relighting Any Object via Diffusion
Single-image relighting requires a model's accurate understanding of involves reasoning about the complex interplay between geometry, materials, and lighting. Many previous methods either support only specific categories of images, such as portraits, or require special capture conditions, like using a flashlight. Additionally, other methods often explicitly decompose a scene into intrinsic components, such as normals and BRDFs, which can be inaccurate or under-expressive. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end 2D relighting diffusion model, called Neural Gaffer, that takes a single image of any object and can synthesize an accurate, high-quality relit image under any novel environmental lighting condition, simply by conditioning an image generator on a target environment map, without an explicit scene decomposition. Our method builds on a pre-trained diffusion model, and fine-tunes it on a synthetic relighting dataset, harnessing and revealing any inherent understanding of lighting present in the diffusion model. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and in-the-wild Internet imagery and demonstrate its advantages in terms of generalization and accuracy. Moreover, by combining with other generative methods, our model enables many downstream 2D tasks, such as text-based relighting and object insertion.Our model can also operate as a strong relighting prior for 3D tasks, such as relighting a radiance field.

Neural Isometries: Taming Transformations for Equivariant ML
Real-world geometry and 3D vision tasks are replete with challenging symmetries that defy tractable analytical expression. In this paper, we introduce Neural Isometries, an autoencoder framework which learns to map the observation space to a general-purpose latent space wherein encodings are related by isometries whenever their corresponding observations are geometrically related in world space. Specifically, we regularize the latent space such that maps between encodings preserve a learned inner product and commute with a learned functional operator, in the same manner as rigid-body transformations commute with the Laplacian. This approach forms an effective backbone for self-supervised representation learning, and we demonstrate that a simple off-the-shelf equivariant network operating in the pre-trained latent space can achieve results on par with meticulously-engineered, handcrafted networks designed to handle complex, nonlinear symmetries. Furthermore, isometric maps capture information about the respective transformations in world space, and we show that this allows us to regress camera poses directly from the coefficients of the maps between encodings of adjacent views of a scene.

Neural Krylov Iteration for Accelerating Linear System Solving
Solving large-scale sparse linear systems is essential in fields like mathematics, science, and engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, mainly based on the Krylov subspace iteration algorithm, suffer from the low efficiency problem, which primarily arises from the less-than-ideal iteration. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method, namely Neural Krylov Iteration (NeurKItt), for accelerating linear system solving. Specifically, NeurKItt employs a neural operator to predict the invariant subspace of the linear system and then leverages the predicted subspace to accelerate linear system solving. To enhance the subspace prediction accuracy, we utilize QR decomposition for the neural operator outputs and introduce a novel projection loss function for training. NeurKItt benefits the solving by using the predicted subspace to guide the iteration process, which significantly reduces the number of iterations. We provide extensive experiments and comprehensive theoretical analyses to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of NeurKItt. In our main experiments, NeurKItt accelerates the solving of linear systems across various settings and datasets, achieving up to a 5.5× speedup in computation time and a 16.1× speedup in the number of iterations.

Neural networks with fast and bounded units learn flexible task abstractions
Artificial neural networks are an important model of neural circuits and cognition, but they differ in how they handle dynamically changing environments. Whereas animals leverage distribution changes to segment their continuous stream of experience and respond flexibly (flexible and adaptive regime), neural networks forget previous distributions after a change and are best trained with shuffled datasets that animals find challenging  (forgetful regime). Here, we analyze a linear gated network where the weights and gates are jointly optimized via gradient descent, but with neuron-like constraints on the gates including non-negativity, faster timescale, and regularization. We observe that modules in the weights layer specialize to the tasks encountered, and gating units switch these modules as needed. We analytically reduce the learning dynamics to an effective eigenspace and show that efficient gating drives weight specialization by protecting previous knowledge, while weight specialization increases the update rate of the gating layer. Task switching in the gating layer accelerates as a function of curriculum block size and task training, mirroring key findings in cognitive neuroscience. We show that the discovered task abstractions support generalization through both task and subtask composition, and we extend our findings to the non-linear setting of a neural network trained on two tasks. Finally, to generalize our findings, we apply the neuronal constraints to the second layer weights of deep monolithic network and induce the adaptive learning regime, without any other architectural assumptions.Overall, our work offers a theory of blocked online learning in animals as arising from joint gradient descent on synaptic and neural gating in a neural network architecture.

Neural P$^3$M: A Long-Range Interaction Modeling Enhancer for Geometric GNNs
Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling molecular geometry. However, they encounter limitations in effectively capturing long-range interactions in large molecular systems. To address this challenge, we introduce **Neural P$^3$M**, a versatile enhancer of geometric GNNs to expand the scope of their capabilities by incorporating mesh points alongside atoms and reimaging traditional mathematical operations in a trainable manner. Neural P$^3$M exhibits flexibility across a wide range of molecular systems and demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting energies and forces, outperforming on benchmarks such as the MD22 dataset. It also achieves an average improvement of 22% on the OE62 dataset while integrating with various architectures.

Neural Pose Representation Learning for Generating and Transferring Non-Rigid Object Poses
We propose a novel method for learning representations of poses for 3D deformable objects, which specializes in 1) disentangling pose information from the object's identity, 2) facilitating the learning of pose variations, and 3) transferring pose information to other object identities. Based on these properties, our method enables the generation of 3D deformable objects with diversity in both identities and poses, using variations of a single object. It does not require explicit shape parameterization such as skeletons or joints, point-level or shape-level correspondence supervision, or variations of the target object for pose transfer.To achieve pose disentanglement, compactness for generative models, and transferability, we first design the pose extractor to represent the pose as a keypoint-based hybrid representation and the pose applier to learn an implicit deformation field. To better distill pose information from the object's geometry, we propose the implicit pose applier to output an intrinsic mesh property, the face Jacobian. Once the extracted pose information is transferred to the target object, the pose applier is fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to better describe the target object's shapes with pose variations. The extracted poses are also used to train a cascaded diffusion model to enable the generation of novel poses.Our experiments with the DeformThings4D and Human datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in pose transfer and the ability to generate diverse deformed shapes with various objects and poses.

Neural Residual Diffusion Models for Deep Scalable Vision Generation
The most advanced diffusion models have recently adopted increasingly deep stacked networks (e.g., U-Net or Transformer) to promote the generative emergence capabilities of vision generation models similar to large language models (LLMs). However, progressively deeper stacked networks will intuitively cause numerical propagation errors and reduce noisy prediction capabilities on generative data, which hinders massively deep scalable training of vision generation models. In this paper, we first uncover the nature that neural networks being able to effectively perform generative denoising lies in the fact that the intrinsic residual unit has consistent dynamic property with the input signal's reverse diffusion process, thus supporting excellent generative abilities.Afterwards, we stand on the shoulders of two common types of deep stacked networks to propose a unified and massively scalable Neural Residual Diffusion Models framework (Neural-RDM for short), which is a simple yet meaningful change to the common architecture of deep generative networks by introducing a series of learnable gated residual parameters that conform to the generative dynamics. Experimental results on various generative tasks show that the proposed neural residual models obtain state-of-the-art scores on image's and video's generative benchmarks. Rigorous theoretical proofs and extensive experiments also demonstrate the advantages of this simple gated residual mechanism consistent with dynamic modeling in improving the  fidelity and consistency of generated content and supporting large-scale scalable training. Code is available at https://github.com/Anonymous/Neural-RDM.

NeuralSteiner: Learning Steiner Tree for Overflow-avoiding Global Routing in Chip Design
Global routing plays a critical role in modern chip design. The routing paths generated by global routers often form a rectilinear Steiner tree (RST). Recent advances from the machine learning community have shown the power of learning-based route generation; however, the yielded routing paths by the existing approaches often suffer from considerable overflow, thus greatly hindering their application in practice.We propose NeuralSteiner, an accurate approach to overflow-avoiding global routing in chip design. The key idea of NeuralSteiner approach is to learn Steiner trees: we first predict the locations of highly likely Steiner points by adopting a neural network considering full-net spatial and overflow information, then select appropriate points by running a graph-based post-processing algorithm, and finally connect these points with the input pins to yield overflow-avoiding RSTs. NeuralSteiner offers two advantages over previous learning-based models. First, by using the learning scheme, NeuralSteiner ensures the connectivity of generated routes while significantly reducing congestion. Second, NeuralSteiner can effectively scale to large nets and transfer to unseen chip designs without any modifications or fine-tuning.  Extensive experiments over public large-scale benchmarks reveal that, compared with the state-of-the-art deep generative methods, NeuralSteiner achieves up to a 99.8\% reduction in overflow while speeding up the generation and maintaining a slight wirelength loss within only 1.8\%.

NeuralThink: Learning Algorithms For Consistent and Efficient Extrapolation Across General Tasks
While machine learning methods excel at pattern recognition, they struggle with complex reasoning tasks in a scalable, algorithmic manner. Deep Thinking methods show promise in learning algorithms that extrapolate: that are learned in small environments and executed in larger environments without loss in performance. However, these works are limited to symmetrical tasks (such as image generation) where the input and output dimensionalities are the same. We propose NeuralThink, a novel Deep Thinking architecture that can efficiently and consistently learn algorithms that extrapolate in both symmetrical and asymmetrical tasks, where the dimensionality of the input and output are different. We introduce a set of novel asymmetrical tasks to evaluate the extrapolation performance of Deep Thinking methods. We show that NeuralThink consistently outperforms the prior state-of-the-art Deep Thinking approaches in consistently extrapolating to large observations, considering smaller training sizes and requiring less parameters.

NeuroBOLT: Resting-state EEG-to-fMRI Synthesis with Multi-dimensional Feature Mapping
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an indispensable tool in modern neuroscience, providing a non-invasive window into whole-brain dynamics at millimeter-scale spatial resolution. However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Only a few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals has been limited to a small set of brain areas, and exclusively to task conditions. The ability to generalize to other brain areas, as well as to other conditions (such as resting state), remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, a transformer-based model that leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and significantly advancing the integration of these two modalities.

NeuRodin: A Two-stage Framework for High-Fidelity Neural Surface Reconstruction
Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based volume rendering has demonstrated significant capabilities in surface reconstruction. Although promising, SDF-based methods often fail to capture detailed geometric structures, resulting in visible defects. By comparing SDF-based volume rendering to density-based volume rendering, we identify two main factors within the SDF-based approach that degrade surface quality: SDF-to-density representation and geometric regularization. These factors introduce challenges that hinder the optimization of the SDF field. To address these issues, we introduce NeuRodin, a novel two-stage neural surface reconstruction framework that not only achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction but also retains the flexible optimization characteristics of density-based methods.   NeuRodin incorporates innovative strategies that facilitate transformation of arbitrary topologies and reduce artifacts associated with density bias.  Extensive evaluations on the Tanks and Temples and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of NeuRodin, showing strong reconstruction capabilities for both indoor and outdoor environments using solely posed RGB captures.

Neuronal Competition Groups with Supervised STDP for Spike-Based Classification
Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is a promising substitute to backpropagation for local training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware. STDP allows SNNs to address classification tasks by combining unsupervised STDP for feature extraction and supervised STDP for classification. Unsupervised STDP is usually employed with Winner-Takes-All (WTA) competition to learn distinct patterns. However, WTA for supervised STDP classification faces unbalanced competition challenges. In this paper, we propose a method to effectively implement WTA competition in a spiking classification layer employing first-spike coding and supervised STDP training. We introduce the Neuronal Competition Group (NCG), an architecture that improves classification capabilities by promoting the learning of various patterns per class. An NCG is a group of neurons mapped to a specific class, implementing intra-class WTA and a novel competition regulation mechanism based on two-compartment thresholds. We incorporate our proposed architecture into spiking classification layers trained with state-of-the-art supervised STDP rules. On top of two different unsupervised feature extractors, we obtain significant accuracy improvements on image recognition datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. We show that our competition regulation mechanism is crucial for ensuring balanced competition and improved class separation.

Newswire: A Large-Scale Structured Database of a Century of Historical News
In the U.S. historically, local newspapers drew their content largely from newswires like the Associated Press. Historians argue that newswires played a pivotal role in creating a national identity and shared understanding of the world, but there is no comprehensive archive of the content sent over newswires. We reconstruct such an archive by applying a customized deep learning pipeline to hundreds of terabytes of raw image scans from thousands of local newspapers. The resulting dataset contains 2.7 million unique public domain U.S. news wire articles, written between 1878 and 1977. Locations in these articles are georeferenced, topics are tagged using customized neural topic classification, named entities are recognized, and individuals are disambiguated to Wikipedia using a novel entity disambiguation model. To construct the Newswire dataset, we first recognize newspaper layouts and transcribe around 138 millions structured article texts from raw image scans. We then use a customized neural bi-encoder model to de-duplicate reproduced articles, in the presence of considerable abridgement and noise, quantifying how widely each article was reproduced. A text classifier is used to ensure that we only include newswire articles, which historically are in the public domain. The structured data that accompany the texts provide rich information about the who (disambiguated individuals), what (topics), and where (georeferencing) of the news that millions of Americans read over the course of a century. We also include Library of Congress metadata information about the newspapers that ran the articles on their front pages. The Newswire dataset is useful both for large language modeling - expanding training data beyond what is available from modern web texts - and for studying a diversity of questions in computational linguistics, social science, and the digital humanities.

Nimbus: Secure and Efficient Two-Party Inference for Transformers
Transformer models have gained significant attention due to their power in machine learning tasks. Their extensive deployment has raised concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information during inference. However, when being applied to Transformers, existing approaches based on secure two-party computation (2PC) bring about efficiency limitations in two folds: (1) resource-intensive matrix multiplications in linear layers, and (2) complex non-linear activation functions like $\mathsf{GELU}$ and $\mathsf{Softmax}$. This work presents a new two-party inference framework $\mathsf{Nimbus}$ for Transformer models. Specifically, we propose a new 2PC paradigm to securely compute matrix multiplications based on an outer-product insight, which achieves $2.9\times \sim 12.5\times$ performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) protocol. Furthermore, through a new observation of utilizing the input distribution, we propose an approach of low-degree polynomial approximation for $\mathsf{GELU}$ and $\mathsf{Softmax}$, which improves the performance of the SOTA polynomial approximation by $2.9\times \sim 4.0\times$, where the average accuracy loss of our approach is 0.08\% compared to the non-2PC inference without privacy. Compared with the SOTA two-party inference, $\mathsf{Nimbus}$ improves the end-to-end performance of $BERT_{base}$ inference by $2.7\times \sim 4.7\times$ across different network settings.

No Filter: Towards Cultural and Socioeconomic Diversity in Multimodal Systems
We study cultural and socioeconomic diversity in contrastive vision-language models (VLMs). Using a broad range of benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, we bring to attention several important considerations. First, filtering training data to English-only image-text pairs disadvantages communities of lower socioeconomic status and negatively impacts cultural understanding. Notably, this performance gap is not sufficiently captured by - and even at odds with - popular evaluation metrics, such as those derived from the Western-oriented ImageNet and COCO datasets. Second, pretraining with global, unfiltered data before fine-tuning on English-only content improves cultural understanding without sacrificing performance on popular, Western-centric benchmarks. Thirdly, we introduce the task of geo-localization based on datasets such as Crossmodal-3600, Dollar Street, and GeoDE, as a novel metric to assess cultural diversity in these models. Our work underscores the importance of diversifying training data to create more inclusive multimodal systems and lays the groundwork for developing VLMs that better represent global perspectives.

No Free Lunch in LLM Watermarking: Trade-offs in Watermarking Design Choices
Advances in generative models have made it possible for AI-generated text, code, and images to mirror human-generated content in many applications. Watermarking, a technique that aims to embed information in the output of a model to verify its source, is useful for mitigating the misuse of such AI-generated content. However, we show that common design choices in LLM watermarking schemes make the resulting systems  surprisingly susceptible to attack---leading to fundamental trade-offs in robustness, utility, and usability. To navigate these trade-offs, we rigorously study a set of simple yet effective attacks on common watermarking systems, and propose  guidelines and defenses for LLM watermarking in practice.

No Free Lunch Theorem and Black-Box Complexity Analysis for Adversarial Optimisation
Black-box optimisation is one of the important areas in optimisation. The original No Free Lunch (NFL) Theorems highlight the limitations of traditional black-box optimisation and learning algorithms, serving as a theoretical foundation for traditional optimisation. No Free Lunch Analysis in adversarial (also called \maximin) optimisation is a long-standing problem \cite{wolpert1997no,wolpert_coevolutionary_2005}. This paper first rigorously proves a (NFL) theorem for general black-box adversarial optimisation when considering Nash Equilibrium (NE) as the solution concept. We emphasise the solution concept (i.e. define the optimality in adversarial optimisation) as the key in our NFL theorem. In particular, if Nash Equilibrium is considered as the solution concept, then the average performance of all black-box adversarial optimisation algorithms is the same. Moreover, we first introduce black-box complexity to analyse the black-box adversarial optimisation algorithm. We employ Yao's maximin principle and our new NFL Theorem to provide general lower bounds for query complexity of finding Nash Equilibrium in adversarial optimisation. Finally, we illustrate the practical ramifications of our results on simple two-player zero-sum games.More specifically, no black-box optimisation algorithm for finding the unique Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games can exceed the logarithmic complexity relative to search space size. Meanwhile, no black-box algorithm can solve any bimatrix game with unique NE faster than the linear query complexity in terms of the size of input payoff matrices.

Noise-Aware Differentially Private Regression via Meta-Learning
Many high-stakes applications require machine learning models that protect user privacy and provide well-calibrated, accurate predictions. While Differential Privacy (DP) is the gold standard for protecting user privacy, standard DP mechanisms typically significantly impair performance. One approach to mitigating this issue is pre-training models on simulated data before DP learning on the private data. In this work we go a step further, using simulated data to train a meta-learning model that combines the Convolutional Conditional Neural Process (ConvCNP) with an improved functional DP mechanism of Hall et al. (2013), yielding the DPConvCNP. DPConvCNP learns from simulated data how to map private data to a DP predictive model in one forward pass, and then provides accurate, well-calibrated predictions. We compare DPConvCNP with a DP Gaussian Process (GP) baseline with carefully tuned hyperparameters. The DPConvCNP outperforms the GP baseline, especially on non-Gaussian data, yet is much faster at test time and requires less tuning.

Noise Contrastive Alignment of Language Models with Explicit Rewards
User intentions are typically formalized as evaluation rewards to be maximized when fine-tuning language models (LMs). Existing alignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are mainly tailored for pairwise preference data where rewards are implicitly defined rather than explicitly given. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for LM alignment, leveraging Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) to bridge the gap in handling reward datasets explicitly annotated with scalar evaluations. Our framework comprises two parallel algorithms, NCA and InfoNCA, both enabling the direct extraction of an LM policy from reward data as well as preference data. Notably, we show that the DPO loss is a special case of our proposed InfoNCA objective under pairwise preference settings, thereby integrating and extending current alignment theories. By comparing NCA and InfoNCA, we demonstrate that the well-observed decreasing-likelihood trend of DPO/InfoNCA is caused by their focus on adjusting relative likelihood across different responses.In contrast, NCA optimizes the absolute likelihood for each response, thereby effectively preventing the chosen likelihood from decreasing. We evaluate our methods in both reward and preference settings with Mistral-8$\times$7B and 7B models. Experiments suggest that InfoNCA/NCA surpasses various preference baselines when reward datasets are available. We also find NCA significantly outperforms DPO in complex reasoning tasks like math and coding.

Noisy Dual Mirror Descent: A Near Optimal Algorithm for Jointly-DP Convex Resource Allocation
We study convex resource allocation problems with $m$ hard constraints under $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-joint differential privacy (JDP) in an offline setting. To approximately solve the problem, we propose a generic algorithm called Noisy Dual Mirror Descent. The algorithm applies noisy Mirror Descent to a dual problem from relaxing the hard constraints for private shadow prices, and then uses the shadow prices to coordinate allocations in the primal problem. Leveraging weak duality theory, we show that the optimality gap is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\sqrt{m\ln(1/\delta)}}{\varepsilon})$, and constraint violation is no more than $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\sqrt{m\ln(1/\delta)}}{\varepsilon})$ per constraint. When strong duality holds, both preceding results can be improved to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{\sqrt{\ln(1/\delta)}}{\varepsilon})$ by better utilizing the geometric structure of the dual space, which is neglected by existing works. To complete our results, we derive a minimax lower bound $\Omega(\frac{m}{\varepsilon})$ for any JDP algorithm outputting feasible allocations. The lower bound matches our upper bounds up to some logarithmic factors for $\varepsilon\geq \max(1, 1/(n\gamma))$, where $n\gamma$ is the available resource level. Numerical studies further confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.

NoisyGL: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks under Label Noise
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) exhibit strong potential in node classification task through a message-passing mechanism. However, their performance often hinges on high-quality node labels, which are challenging to obtain in real-world scenarios due to unreliable sources or adversarial attacks. Consequently, label noise is common in real-world graph data, negatively impacting GNNs by propagating incorrect information during training. To address this issue, the study of Graph Neural Networks under Label Noise (GLN) has recently gained traction. However, due to variations in dataset selection, data splitting, and preprocessing techniques, the community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark, which impedes deeper understanding and further development of GLN. To fill this gap, we introduce NoisyGL in this paper, the first comprehensive benchmark for graph neural networks under label noise. NoisyGL enables fair comparisons and detailed analyses of GLN methods on noisy labeled graph data across various datasets, with unified experimental settings and interface. Our benchmark has uncovered several important insights that were missed in previous research, and we believe these findings will be highly beneficial for future studies. We hope our open-source benchmark library will foster further advancements in this field. The code of the benchmark can be found in https://github.com/eaglelab-zju/NoisyGL.

Noisy Label Learning with Instance-Dependent Outliers: Identifiability via Crowd Wisdom
The generation of label noise is often modeled as a process involving a probability transition matrix (often interpreted as the {\it annotator confusion matrix}) imposed onto the ground-truth label distribution.Under this model, rectifying the label noise and learning the target classifier boil down to identifying the confusion matrix. This line of work demonstrated appealing empirical performance, yet identifiability of the model was mostly established by assuming an instance-invariant confusion matrix. Having an (occasionally) instance-dependent confusion matrix across data samples is apparently more realistic, but inevitably introduces outliers to the model.Our interest lies in confusion matrix-based noisy label learning with such outliers taken into consideration.We begin with pointing out that under the model of interest, detecting the outliers in the presence of a single confusion matrix is fundamentally insufficient.Then, we prove that by employing a crowdsourcing strategy involving multiple annotators, a carefully designed loss function can detect the outliers and identify the desired classifier under reasonable conditions.Our development builds upon a link between the noisy label model and a column-corrupted matrix factorization model---which turns out attesting to the importance of crowdsourced data annotation. Experiments show that our learning scheme substantially improves the outlier detection probability and the learned neural systems' testing accuracy.

Noisy Ostracods: A Fine-Grained, Imbalanced Real-World Dataset for Benchmarking Robust Machine Learning and Label Correction Methods
We present the Noisy Ostracods, a noisy dataset for genus and species classification of crustacean ostracods with specialists' annotations. Over the 71466 specimens collected, 5.58\% of them are estimated to be noisy (possibly problematic) at genus level. The dataset is created to addressing a real-world challenge: creating a clean fine-grained taxonomy dataset. The Noisy Ostracods dataset has diverse noises from multiple sources. Firstly, the noise is open-set, including new classes discovered during curation that were not part of the original annotation. The dataset has pseudo-classes, where annotators misclassified samples that should belong to an existing class into a new pseudo-class. The Noisy Ostracods dataset is highly imbalanced, with the most frequent class, $sinocytheridea$ $impressa$, comprising over 30\% of the data. This presents a unique challenge for robust machine learning methods, as existing approaches have not been extensively evaluated on fine-grained classification tasks with such diverse real-world noise. Initial experiments using current robust learning techniques have not yielded significant performance improvements on the Noisy Ostracods dataset compared to cross-entropy training on the raw, noisy data. On the other hand, noise detection methods have underperformed in error hit rate compared to simple cross-validation ensembling for identifying problematic labels. These findings suggest that the fine-grained, imbalanced nature, and complex noise characteristics of the dataset present considerable challenges for existing noise-robust algorithms. By openly releasing the Noisy Ostracods dataset, our goal is to encourage further research into the development of noise-resilient machine learning methods capable of effectively handling diverse, real-world noise in fine-grained classification tasks. The dataset, along with its evaluation protocols, can be accessed at https://github.com/H-Jamieu/Noisy_ostracods.

Non-asymptotic Convergence of Training Transformers for Next-token Prediction
Transformers have achieved extraordinary success in modern machine learning due to their excellent ability to handle sequential data, especially in next-token prediction (NTP) tasks. However, the theoretical understanding of their performance in NTP is limited, with existing studies focusing mainly on asymptotic performance. This paper provides a fine-grained non-asymptotic analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer transformer consisting of a self-attention module followed by a feed-forward layer. We first characterize the essential structural properties of training datasets for NTP using a mathematical framework based on partial orders. Then, we design a two-stage training algorithm, where the pre-processing stage for training the feed-forward layer and the main stage for training the attention layer exhibit fast convergence performance. Specifically, both layers converge sub-linearly to the direction of their corresponding max-margin solutions. We also show that the cross-entropy loss enjoys a linear convergence rate. Furthermore, we show that the trained transformer presents non-trivial prediction ability with dataset shift, which sheds light on the remarkable generalization performance of transformers. Our analysis technique involves the development of novel properties on the attention gradient and further in-depth analysis of how these properties contribute to the convergence of the training process. Our experiments further validate our theoretical findings.

Non-asymptotic Global Convergence Analysis of BFGS with the Armijo-Wolfe Line Search
In this paper, we present the first explicit and non-asymptotic global convergence rates of the BFGS method when implemented with an inexact line search scheme satisfying the Armijo-Wolfe conditions. We show that BFGS achieves a global linear convergence rate of $(1 - \frac{1}{\kappa})^t$ for $\mu$-strongly convex functions with $L$-Lipschitz gradients, where $\kappa = \frac{L}{\mu}$ represents the condition number. Additionally, if the objective function's Hessian is Lipschitz, BFGS with the Armijo-Wolfe line search achieves a linear convergence rate that depends solely on the line search parameters, independent of the condition number. We also establish a global superlinear convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}((\frac{1}{t})^t)$. These global bounds are all valid for any starting point $x_0$ and any symmetric positive definite initial Hessian approximation matrix $B_0$, though the choice of $B_0$ impacts the number of iterations needed to achieve these rates. By synthesizing these results, we outline the first global complexity characterization of BFGS with the Armijo-Wolfe line search. Additionally, we clearly define a mechanism for selecting the step size to satisfy the Armijo-Wolfe conditions and characterize its overall complexity.

Non-Asymptotic Uncertainty Quantification in High-Dimensional Learning
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a crucial but challenging task in many high-dimensional regression or learning problems to increase the confidence of a given predictor. We develop a new data-driven approach for UQ in regression that applies both to classical optimization approaches such as the LASSO as well as to neural networks. One of the most notable UQ techniques is the debiased LASSO, which modifies the LASSO to allow for the construction of asymptotic confidence intervals by decomposing the estimation error into a Gaussian and an asymptotically vanishing bias component. However, in real-world problems with finite-dimensional data, the bias term is often too significant to disregard, resulting in overly narrow confidence intervals. Our work rigorously addresses this issue and derives a data-driven adjustment that corrects the confidence intervals for a large class of predictors by estimating the means and variances of the bias terms from training data, exploiting high-dimensional concentration phenomena. This gives rise to non-asymptotic confidence intervals, which can help avoid overestimating certainty in critical applications such as MRI diagnosis. Importantly, our analysis extends beyond sparse regression to data-driven predictors like neural networks, enhancing the reliability of model-based deep learning. Our findings bridge the gap between established theory and the practical applicability of such methods.

Non-convolutional graph neural networks.
Rethink convolution-based graph neural networks (GNN)---they characteristically suffer from limited expressiveness, over-smoothing, and over-squashing, and require specialized sparse kernels for efficient computation.Here, we design a simple graph learning module entirely free of convolution operators, coined _random walk with unifying memory_ (RUM) neural network, where an RNN merges the topological and semantic graph features along the random walks terminating at each node.Relating the rich literature on RNN behavior and graph topology, we theoretically show and experimentally verify that RUM attenuates the aforementioned symptoms and is more expressive than the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) isomorphism test.On a variety of node- and graph-level classification and regression tasks, RUM not only achieves competitive performance, but is also robust, memory-efficient, scalable, and faster than the simplest convolutional GNNs.

Non-Euclidean Mixture Model for Social Network Embedding
It is largely agreed that social network links are formed due to either homophily or social influence. Inspired by this, we aim at understanding the generation of links via providing a novel embedding-based graph formation model. Different from existing graph representation learning, where link generation probabilities are defined as a simple function of the corresponding node embeddings, we model the link generation as a mixture model of the two factors. In addition, we model the homophily factor in spherical space and the influence factor in hyperbolic space to accommodate the fact that (1) homophily results in cycles and (2) influence results in hierarchies in networks. We also design a special projection to align these two spaces. We call this model Non-Euclidean Mixture Model, i.e., NMM. We further integrate NMM with our non-Euclidean graph variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, NMM-GNN. NMM-GNN learns embeddings through a unified framework which uses non-Euclidean GNN encoders, non-Euclidean Gaussian priors, a non-Euclidean decoder, and a novel space unification loss component to unify distinct non-Euclidean geometric spaces. Experiments on public datasets show NMM-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on social network generation and classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to better explain how the social network is formed.

Non-geodesically-convex optimization in the Wasserstein space
We study a class of optimization problems in the Wasserstein space (the space of probability measures) where the objective function is nonconvex along generalized geodesics. When the regularization term is the negative entropy, the optimization problem becomes a sampling problem where it minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a probability measure (optimization variable) and a target probability measure whose logarithmic probability density is a nonconvex function. We derive multiple convergence insights for a novel semi Forward-Backward Euler scheme under several nonconvex (and possibly nonsmooth) regimes. Notably, the semi Forward-Backward Euler is just a slight modification of the Forward-Backward Euler whose convergence is---to our knowledge---still unknown in our very general non-geodesically-convex setting.

Nonparametric Classification on Low Dimensional Manifolds using Overparameterized Convolutional Residual Networks
Convolutional residual neural networks (ConvResNets), though overparametersized, can achieve remarkable prediction performance in practice, which cannot be well explained by conventional wisdom. To bridge this gap, we study the performance of ConvResNeXts trained with weight decay, which cover ConvResNets as a special case, from the perspective of nonparametric classification. Our analysis allows for infinitely many building blocks in ConvResNeXts, and shows that weight decay implicitly enforces sparsity on these blocks. Specifically, we consider a smooth target function supported on a low-dimensional manifold, then prove that ConvResNeXts can adapt to the function smoothness and low-dimensional structures and efficiently learn the function without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Our findings partially justify the advantage of overparameterized ConvResNeXts over conventional machine learning models.

Non-parametric classification via expand-and-sparsify representation
In *expand-and-sparsify* (EaS) representation, a data point in $\mathcal{S}^{d-1}$ is first randomly mapped to higher dimension $\mathbb{R}^m$, where $m>d$, followed by a sparsification operation where the informative $k \ll m$ of the $m$ coordinates are set to one and the rest are set to zero. We propose two algorithms for non-parametric classification using such EaS representation. For our first algorithm, we use *winners-take-all* operation for the sparsification step and show that the proposed classifier admits the form of a locally weighted average classifier and establish its consistency via Stone's Theorem. Further, assuming that the conditional probability function $P(y=1|x)=\eta(x)$ is H\"{o}lder continuous and for optimal choice of $m$, we show that the convergence rate of this classifier is minimax-optimal. For our second algorithm, we use *empirical $k$-thresholding* operation for the sparsification step, and under the assumption that data lie on a low dimensional manifold of dimension $d_0\ll d$, we show that the convergence rate of this classifier depends only on $d_0$ and is again minimax-optimal. Empirical evaluations performed on real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical results.

Nonparametric Evaluation of Noisy ICA Solutions
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was introduced in the 1980's as a model for Blind Source Separation (BSS), which refers to the process of recovering the sources underlying a mixture of signals, with little knowledge about the source signals or the mixing process. While there are many sophisticated algorithms for estimation, different methods have different shortcomings. In this paper, we develop a nonparametric score to adaptively pick the right algorithm for ICA with arbitrary Gaussian noise. The novelty of this score stems from the fact that it just assumes a finite second moment of the data and uses the characteristic function to evaluate the quality of the estimated mixing matrix without any knowledge of the parameters of the noise distribution. In addition, we propose some new contrast functions and algorithms that enjoy the same fast computability as existing algorithms like FASTICA and JADE but work in domains where the former may fail. While these also may have weaknesses, our proposed diagnostic, as shown by our simulations, can remedy them. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the local and global convergence properties of our algorithms.

Nonparametric Instrumental Variable Regression through Stochastic Approximate Gradients
Instrumental variables (IVs) provide a powerful strategy for identifying causal effects in the presence of unobservable confounders. Within the nonparametric setting (NPIV), recent methods have been based on nonlinear generalizations of Two-Stage Least Squares and on minimax formulations derived from moment conditions or duality. In a novel direction, we show how to formulate a functional stochastic gradient descent algorithm to tackle NPIV regression by directly minimizing the populational risk. We provide theoretical support in the form of bounds on the excess risk, and conduct numerical experiments showcasing our method's superior stability and competitive performance relative to current state-of-the-art alternatives. This algorithm enables flexible estimator choices, such as neural networks or kernel based methods, as well as non-quadratic loss functions, which may be suitable for structural equations beyond the setting of continuous outcomes and additive noise. Finally, we demonstrate this flexibility of our framework by presenting how it naturally addresses the important case of binary outcomes, which has received far less attention by recent developments in the NPIV literature.

Nonstationary Sparse Spectral Permanental Process
Existing permanental processes often impose constraints on kernel types or stationarity, limiting the model's expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach utilizing the sparse spectral representation of nonstationary kernels. This technique relaxes the constraints on kernel types and stationarity, allowing for more flexible modeling while reducing computational complexity to the linear level. Additionally, we introduce a deep kernel variant by hierarchically stacking multiple spectral feature mappings, further enhancing the model's expressiveness to capture complex patterns in data. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in scenarios with pronounced data nonstationarity. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to provide insights into the impact of various hyperparameters on model performance.

No-Regret Learning for Fair Multi-Agent Social Welfare Optimization
We consider the problem of online multi-agent Nash social welfare (NSW) maximization. While previous works of Hossain et al. [2021], Jones et al. [2023] study similar problems in stochastic multi-agent multi-armed bandits and show that $\sqrt{T}$-regret is possible after $T$ rounds, their fairness measure is the product of all agents' rewards, instead of their NSW (that is, their geometric mean). Given the fundamental role of NSW in the fairness literature, it is more than natural to ask whether no-regret fair learning with NSW as the objective is possible. In this work, we provide a complete answer to this question in various settings. Specifically, in stochastic $N$-agent $K$-armed bandits, we develop an algorithm with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(K^{\frac{2}{N}}T^{\frac{N-1}{N}})$ regret and prove that the dependence on $T$ is tight, making it a sharp contrast to the $\sqrt{T}$-regret bounds of Hossain et al. [2021], Jones et al. [2023]. We then consider a more challenging version of the problem with adversarial rewards. Somewhat surprisingly, despite NSW being a concave function, we prove that no algorithm can achieve sublinear regret. To circumvent such negative results, we further consider a setting with full-information feedback and design two algorithms with $\sqrt{T}$-regret: the first one has no dependence on $N$ at all and is applicable to not just NSW but a broad class of welfare functions, while the second one has better dependence on $K$ and is preferable when $N$ is small.Finally, we also show that logarithmic regret is possible whenever there exists one agent who is indifferent about different arms.

No-regret Learning in Harmonic Games: Extrapolation in the Face of Conflicting Interests
The long-run behavior of multi-agent online learning -- and, in particular, no-regret learning -- is relatively well-understood in potential games, where players have common interests. By contrast, in general harmonic games -- the strategic complement of potential games, where players have competing interests -- very little is known outside the narrow subclass of $2$-player zero-sum games with a fully-mixed equilibrium. Our paper seeks to partially fill this gap by focusing on the full class of (generalized) harmonic games and examining the convergence properties of "follow-the-regularized-leader" (FTRL), the most widely studied class of no-regret learning schemes. As a first result, we show that the continuous-time dynamics of FTRL are Poincaré recurrent, i.e., they return arbitrarily close to their starting point infinitely often, and hence fail to converge. In discrete time, the standard, "vanilla" implementation of FTRL may lead to even worse outcomes, eventually trapping the players in a perpetual cycle of best-responses. However, if FTRL is augmented with a suitable extrapolation step -- which includes as special cases the optimistic and mirror-prox variants of FTRL -- we show that learning converges to a Nash equilibrium from any initial condition, and all players are guaranteed at most $\mathcal{O}(1)$ regret. These results provide an in-depth understanding of no-regret learning in harmonic games, nesting prior work on $2$-player zero-sum games, and showing at a high level that potential and harmonic games are complementary not only from the strategic but also from the dynamic viewpoint.

No-Regret M${}^{\natural}$-Concave Function Maximization: Stochastic Bandit Algorithms and NP-Hardness of Adversarial Full-Information Setting
M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions, a.k.a. gross substitute valuation functions, play a fundamental role in many fields, including discrete mathematics and economics. In practice, perfect knowledge of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions is often unavailable a priori, and we can optimize them only interactively based on some feedback. Motivated by such situations, we study online M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization problems, which are interactive versions of the problem studied by Murota and Shioura (1999). For the stochastic bandit setting, we present $O(T^{-1/2})$-simple regret and $O(T^{2/3})$-regret algorithms under $T$ times access to unbiased noisy value oracles of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions.  A key to proving these results is the robustness of the greedy algorithm to local errors in M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization, which is one of our main technical results. While we obtain those positive results for the stochastic setting, another main result of our work is an impossibility in the adversarial setting. We prove that, even with full-information feedback, no algorithms that run in polynomial time per round can achieve $O(T^{1-c})$ regret for any constant $c > 0$ unless $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$.  Our proof is based on a reduction from the matroid intersection problem for three matroids, which would be a novel idea in the context of online learning.

No Regrets: Investigating and Improving Regret Approximations for Curriculum Discovery
What data or environments to use for training to improve downstream performance is a longstanding and very topical question. In particular, Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) methods have gained recent attention as their adaptive curricula enable agents to be robust to in and out of distribution tasks. We ask to what extent these methods are themselves robust when applied to a novel setting, closely inspired by a real-world problem.  Surprisingly, we find that none of the state-of-the-art UED methods improve upon the naive baseline of Domain Randomisation (DR). Our analysis shows that this is due to their underlying scoring functions failing to predict intuitive measures of *learnability*, i.e. the settings that the agent sometimes solves, but not always. This is also supported by our finding that using *true regret* as a scoring function results in the most robust performance in settings where we can compute it. Based on this we instead directly upsample levels with high levels of learnability and find that this simple and intuitive approach outperforms not just UED methods but also DR on our domain and the standard UED goal-oriented domain of MiniGrid. We had tried our best to make current UED methods work for our setting before going back to the basics and developing our new scoring function, which took a few days and worked out-of-the-box. We hope our lessons and learnings will help others spend their time more wisely. We further introduce a new adversarial evaluation procedure for directly measuring robustness, closely mirroring the conditional value at risk (CVaR). We will open-source all our code and present visualisations of final policies here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/sampling-for-learnability-3594.

Normalization and effective learning rates in reinforcement learning
Normalization layers have recently experienced a renaissance in the deep reinforcement learning and continual learning literature, with several works highlighting diverse benefits such as improving loss landscape conditioning and combatting overestimation bias. However, normalization brings with it a subtle but important side effect: an equivalence between growth in the norm of the network parameters and decay in the effective learning rate. This becomes problematic in continual learning settings, where the resulting learning rate schedule may decay to near zero too quickly relative to the timescale of the learning problem. We propose to make the learning rate schedule explicit with a simple re-parameterization which we call  Normalize-and-Project (NaP), which couples the insertion of normalization layers with weight projection, ensuring that the effective learning rate remains constant throughout training. This technique reveals itself as a powerful analytical tool to better understand learning rate schedules in deep reinforcement learning, and as a means of improving robustness to nonstationarity in synthetic plasticity loss benchmarks along with both the single-task and sequential variants of the Arcade Learning Environment. We also show that our approach can be easily applied to popular architectures such as ResNets and transformers while recovering and in some cases even slightly improving the performance of the base model in common stationary benchmarks.

Normalization Layer Per-Example Gradients are Sufficient to Predict Gradient Noise Scale in Transformers
Per-example gradient norms are a vital ingredient for estimating gradient noise scale with minimal variance. Observing the tensor contractions required to compute them, we propose a method with minimal FLOPs in 3D or greater tensor regimes by simultaneously computing the norms while computing the parameter gradients. Using this method we are able to observe the GNS of different layers at higher accuracy than previously possible. We find that the total GNS of contemporary transformer models is predicted well by the GNS of only the normalization layers. As a result, focusing only on the normalization layer, we develop a custom kernel to compute the per-example gradient norms while performing the LayerNorm backward pass with zero throughput overhead. Tracking GNS on only those layers, we are able to guide a practical batch size schedule that reduces training time by 18% on a Chinchilla-optimal language model.

Norms for Managing Datasets: A Systematic Review of NeurIPS Datasets
As new ML methods require larger training datasets, researchers and developers are left to resolve key challenges around data management. Despite the establishment of ethics review, documentation, and checklist practices, it remains unclear whether the community as a whole has consistent dataset management practices. A lack of a comprehensive overview delays us from systematically diagnosing and addressing core tensions and ethical issues in managing large datasets. We present a systematic review of datasets published under the NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks track, focusing on four aspects: provenance, distribution, ethical disclosure, and licensing. We find that dataset provenance is not always traceable due to unclear filtering or curation processes. A variety of sites were used for dataset hosting and only a few sites support structured metadata and version control. These inconsistencies highlight the need for standardized data infrastructures for publishing and managing datasets.

Not All Diffusion Model Activations Have Been Evaluated as Discriminative Features
Diffusion models are initially designed for image generation. Recent research shows that the internal signals within their backbones, named activations, can also serve as dense features for various discriminative tasks such as semantic segmentation. Given numerous activations, selecting a small yet effective subset poses a fundamental problem. To this end, the early study of this field performs a large-scale quantitative comparison of the discriminative ability of the activations. However, we find that many potential activations have not been evaluated, such as the queries and keys used to compute attention scores. Moreover, recent advancements in diffusion architectures bring many new activations, such as those within embedded ViT modules. Both combined, activation selection remains unresolved but overlooked. To tackle this issue, this paper takes a further step with a much broader range of activations evaluated. Considering the significant increase in activations, a full-scale quantitative comparison is no longer operational. Instead, we seek to understand the properties of these activations, such that the activations that are clearly inferior can be filtered out in advance via simple qualitative evaluation. After careful analysis, we discover three properties universal among diffusion models, enabling this study to go beyond specific models. On top of this, we present effective feature selection solutions for several popular diffusion models. Finally, the experiments across multiple discriminative tasks validate the superiority of our method over the SOTA competitors.

Not Just Object, But State: Compositional Incremental Learning without Forgetting
Most incremental learners excessively prioritize object classes while neglecting various kinds of states (e.g. color and material) attached to the objects. As a result, they are limited in the ability to model state-object compositionality accurately. To remedy this limitation, we propose a novel task called Compositional Incremental Learning (composition-IL), which enables the model to recognize a variety of state-object compositions in an incremental learning fashion. Since the lack of suitable datasets, we re-organize two existing datasets and make them tailored for composition-IL. Then, we propose a prompt-based Composition Incremental Learner (CompILer), to overcome the ambiguous composition boundary. Specifically, we exploit multi-pool prompt learning, and ensure the inter-pool prompt discrepancy and intra-pool prompt diversity. Besides, we devise object-injected state prompting which injects object prompts to guide the selection of state prompts. Furthermore, we fuse the selected prompts by a generalized-mean strategy, to eliminate irrelevant information learned in the prompts. Extensive experiments on two datasets exhibit state-of-the-art performance achieved by CompILer.

Not so griddy: Internal representations of RNNs path integrating more than one agent
Success in collaborative and competitive environments, where agents must work with or against each other, requires individuals to encode the position and trajectory of themselves and others. Decades of neurophysiological experiments have shed light on how brain regions [e.g., medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), hippocampus] encode the self's position and trajectory. However, it has only recently been discovered that MEC and hippocampus are modulated by the positions and trajectories of others. To understand how encoding spatial information of multiple agents shapes neural representations, we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that captures properties of MEC to path integrate trajectories of two agents simultaneously navigating the same environment. We find significant differences between these RNNs and those trained to path integrate only a single agent. At the individual unit level, RNNs trained to path integrate more than one agent develop weaker grid responses, stronger border responses, and tuning for the relative position of the two agents. At the population level, they develop more distributed and robust representations, with changes in network dynamics and manifold topology. Our results provide testable predictions and open new directions with which to study the neural computations supporting spatial navigation.

Novel Object Synthesis via Adaptive Text-Image Harmony
In this paper, we study an object synthesis task that combines an object text with an object image to create a new object image. However, most diffusion models struggle with this task due to the imbalance between text and image inputs. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method called Adaptive Text-Image Harmony (ATIH) for generating novel and surprising objects. First, we introduce a scale factor and an injection step to balance text and image features in cross-attention and to preserve image information in self-attention during the text-image inversion diffusion process, respectively. Second, to adaptively adjust these parameters, we present a novel similarity score function that not only maximizes the similarities between the generated object image and the input text/image but also balances these similarities to harmonize text and image integration. Third, to better integrate object text and image, we design a balanced loss function with a noise parameter, ensuring both optimal editability and fidelity of the object image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing remarkable object creations such as dog-lobster.

NovoBench: Benchmarking Deep Learning-based \emph{De Novo} Sequencing Methods in Proteomics
Tandem mass spectrometry has played a pivotal role in advancing proteomics, enabling the analysis of protein composition in biological tissues. Many deep learning methods have been developed for \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing task, i.e., predicting the peptide sequence for the observed mass spectrum. However, two key challenges seriously hinder the further research of this important task. Firstly, since there is no consensus for the evaluation datasets, the empirical results in different research papers are often not comparable, leading to unfair comparison. Secondly, the current methods are usually limited to amino acid-level or peptide-level precision and recall metrics. In this work, we present the first unified benchmark NovoBench for \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing, which comprises diverse mass spectrum data, integrated models, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. Recent impressive methods, including DeepNovo, PointNovo, Casanovo, InstaNovo, AdaNovo and $\pi$-HelixNovo are integrated into our framework. In addition to amino acid-level and peptide-level precision and recall, we also evaluate the models' performance in terms of identifying post-tranlational modifications (PTMs), efficiency and robustness to peptide length, noise peaks and missing fragment ratio, which are important influencing factors while seldom be considered. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a large-scale study of current methods, report many insightful findings that open up new possibilities for future development. The benchmark is open-sourced to facilitate future research and application. The code is available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/NovoBench-1D62}.

No "Zero-Shot" Without Exponential Data: Pretraining Concept Frequency Determines Multimodal Model Performance
Web-crawled pretraining datasets underlie the impressive "zero-shot" evaluation performance of multimodal models, such as CLIP for classification and Stable-Diffusion for image generation. However, it is unclear how meaningful the notion of "zero-shot" generalization is for such multimodal models, as it is not known to what extent their pretraining datasets encompass the downstream concepts targeted for during "zero-shot" evaluation. In this work, we ask: How is the performance of multimodal models on downstream concepts influenced by the frequency of these concepts in their pretraining datasets?We comprehensively investigate this question across 34 models and 5 standard pretraining datasets (CC-3M, CC-12M, YFCC-15M, LAION-400M, LAION-Aesthetics), generating over 300GB of data artifacts. We consistently find that, far from exhibiting "zero-shot" generalization, multimodal models require exponentially more data to achieve linear improvements in downstream "zero-shot" performance, following a sample inefficient log-linear scaling trend. This trend persists even when controlling for sample-level similarity between pretraining and downstream datasets, and testing on purely synthetic data distributions. Furthermore, upon benchmarking models on long-tailed data sampled based on our analysis, we demonstrate that multimodal models across the board perform poorly. We contribute this long-tail test set as the Let it Wag! benchmark to further research in this direction. Taken together, our study reveals an exponential need for training data which implies that the key to "zero-shot" generalization capabilities under large-scale training data and compute paradigms remains to be found.

Nuclear Fusion Diamond Polishing Dataset
In the Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) process, roughly a 2mm spherical shell made of high-density carbon is used as a target for laser beams, which compress and heat it to energy levels needed for high fusion yield in nuclear fusion. These shells are polished meticulously to meet the standards for a fusion shot. However, the polishing of these shells involves multiple stages, with each stage taking several hours. To make sure that the polishing process is advancing in the right direction, we are able to measure the shell surface roughness. This measurement, however, is very labor-intensive, time-consuming, and requires a human operator. To help improve the polishing process we have released the first dataset to the public that consists of raw vibration signals with the corresponding polishing surface roughness changes. We show that this dataset can be used with a variety of neural network based methods for prediction of the change of polishing surface roughness, hence eliminating the need for the time-consuming manual process. This is the first dataset of its kind to be released in public and its use will allow the operator to make any necessary changes to the ICF polishing process for optimal results. This dataset contains the raw vibration data of multiple polishing runs with their extracted statistical features and the corresponding surface roughness values. Additionally, to generalize the prediction models to different polishing conditions, we also apply domain adaptation techniques to improve prediction accuracy for conditions unseen by the trained model. The dataset is available in \url{https://junzeliu.github.io/Diamond-Polishing-Dataset/}.

Nuclear Norm Regularization for Deep Learning
Penalizing the nuclear norm of a function's Jacobian encourages it to locally behave like a low-rank linear map. Such functions vary locally along only a handful of directions, making the Jacobian nuclear norm a natural regularizer for machine learning problems. However, this regularizer is intractable for high-dimensional problems, as it requires computing a large Jacobian matrix and taking its SVD. We show how to efficiently penalize the Jacobian nuclear norm using techniques tailor-made for deep learning. We prove that for functions parametrized as compositions $f = g \circ h$, one may equivalently penalize the average squared Frobenius norm of $Jg$ and $Jh$. We then propose a denoising-style approximation that avoids the Jacobian computations altogether. Our method is simple, efficient, and accurate, enabling Jacobian nuclear norm regularization to scale to high-dimensional deep learning problems. We complement our theory with an empirical study of our regularizer's performance and investigate applications to denoising and representation learning.

OAM-TCD: A globally diverse dataset of high-resolution tree cover maps
Accurately quantifying tree cover is an important metric for ecosystem monitoring and for assessing progress in restored sites. Recent works have shown that deep learning-based segmentation algorithms are capable of accurately mapping trees at country and continental scales using high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery. Mapping at high (ideally sub-meter) resolution is necessary to identify individual trees, however there are few open-access datasets containing instance level annotations and those that exist are small or not geographically diverse. We present a novel open-access dataset for individual tree crown delineation (TCD) in high-resolution aerial imagery sourced from Open Aerial Map (OAM). Our dataset, OAM-TCD, comprises 5072 2048x2048 px images at 10 cm/px resolution with associated human-verified instance masks for over 280k individual and 56k groups of trees. By sampling imagery from around the world, we are able to better capture the diversity and morphology of trees in different terrestrial biomes and in both urban and natural environments. Using our dataset, we train reference instance and semantic segmentation models that compare favorably to existing state-of-the-art models. We assess performance through k-fold cross-validation and comparison with existing datasets; additionally we demonstrate compelling results on independent aerial imagery captured over Switzerland and compare to municipal tree inventories and LIDAR-derived canopy maps in the city of Zurich. Our dataset, models and training/benchmark code are publicly released under permissive open-source licenses (Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 and Apache 2.0 respectively).

OASIS: Conditional Distribution Shaping for Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning
Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) aims to train a policy that satisfies constraints using a pre-collected dataset. Most current methods struggle with the mismatch between imperfect demonstrations and the desired safe and rewarding performance. In this paper, we introduce  OASIS (cOnditionAl diStributIon Shaping), a new paradigm in offline safe RL designed to overcome these critical limitations. OASIS utilizes a conditional diffusion model to synthesize offline datasets, thus shaping the data distribution toward a beneficial target domain. Our approach makes compliance with safety constraints through effective data utilization and regularization techniques to benefit offline safe RL training. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks and varying datasets showcase OASIS's superiority in benefiting offline safe RL agents to achieve high-reward behavior while satisfying the safety constraints, outperforming established baselines. Furthermore, OASIS exhibits high data efficiency and robustness, making it suitable for real-world applications, particularly in tasks where safety is imperative and high-quality demonstrations are scarce.

OccFusion: Rendering Occluded Humans with Generative Diffusion Priors
Existing human rendering methods require every part of the human to be fully visible throughout the input video. However, this assumption does not hold in real-life settings where obstructions are common, resulting in only partial visibility of the human. Considering this, we present OccFusion, an approach that utilizes efficient 3D Gaussian splatting supervised by pretrained 2D diffusion models for efficient and high-fidelity human rendering. We propose a pipeline consisting of three stages. In the Initialization stage, complete human masks are generated from partial visibility masks. In the Optimization stage, 3D human Gaussians are optimized with additional supervisions by Score-Distillation Sampling (SDS) to create a complete geometry of the human. Finally, in the Refinement stage, in-context inpainting is designed to further improve rendering quality on the less observed human body parts. We evaluate OccFusion on ZJU-MoCap and challenging OcMotion sequences and found that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the rendering of occluded humans.

ODGEN: Domain-specific Object Detection Data Generation with Diffusion Models
Modern diffusion-based image generative models have made significant progress and become promising to enrich training data for the object detection task. However, the generation quality and the controllability for complex scenes containing multi-class objects and dense objects with occlusions remain limited. This paper presents ODGEN, a novel method to generate high-quality images conditioned on bounding boxes, thereby facilitating data synthesis for object detection. Given a domain-specific object detection dataset, we first fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model on both cropped foreground objects and entire images to fit target distributions. Then we propose to control the diffusion model using synthesized visual prompts with spatial constraints and object-wise textual descriptions. ODGEN exhibits robustness in handling complex scenes and specific domains. Further, we design a dataset synthesis pipeline to evaluate ODGEN on 7 domain-specific benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness. Adding training data generated by ODGEN improves up to 25.3% mAP@.50:.95 with object detectors like YOLOv5 and YOLOv7, outperforming prior controllable generative methods. In addition, we design an evaluation protocol based on COCO-2014 to validate ODGEN in general domains and observe an advantage up to 5.6% in mAP@.50:.95 against existing methods.

Offline Reinforcement Learning with OOD State Correction and OOD Action Suppression
In offline reinforcement learning (RL), addressing the out-of-distribution (OOD) action issue has been a focus, but we argue that there exists an OOD state issue that also impairs performance yet has been underexplored. Such an issue describes the scenario when the agent encounters states out of the offline dataset during the test phase, leading to uncontrolled behavior and performance degradation. To this end, we propose SCAS, a simple yet effective approach that unifies OOD state correction and OOD action suppression in offline RL. Technically, SCAS achieves value-aware OOD state correction, capable of correcting the agent from OOD states to high-value in-distribution states. Theoretical and empirical results show that SCAS also exhibits the effect of suppressing OOD actions. On standard offline RL benchmarks, SCAS achieves excellent performance without additional hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, benefiting from its OOD state correction feature, SCAS demonstrates enhanced robustness against environmental perturbations.

Oja's Algorithm for Sparse PCA
Oja's algorithm for Streaming Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for $n$ data-points in a $d$ dimensional space achieves the same sin-squared error $O(r_{\mathsf{eff}}/n)$ as the offline algorithm in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time and a single pass through the datapoints. Here $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ is the effective rank (ratio of the trace and the principal eigenvalue of the population covariance matrix $\Sigma$). Under this computational budget, we consider the problem of sparse PCA, where the principal eigenvector of $\Sigma$ is $s$-sparse, and $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ can be large. In this setting, to our knowledge, \textit{there are no known single-pass algorithms} that achieve the minimax error bound in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time without either requiring strong initialization conditions or assuming further structure (e.g., spiked) of the covariance matrix.We show that a simple single-pass procedure that thresholds the output of Oja's algorithm (the Oja vector) can achieve the minimax error bound under some regularity conditions in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time.  We present a nontrivial and novel analysis of the entries of the unnormalized Oja vector, which involves the projection of a product of independent random matrices on a random initial vector. This is completely different from previous analyses of Oja's algorithm and matrix products, which have been done when the $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ is bounded.

OmniJARVIS: Unified Vision-Language-Action Tokenization Enables Open-World Instruction Following Agents
This paper presents OmniJARVIS, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for open-world instruction-following agents in open-world Minecraft. Compared to prior works that either emit textual goals to separate controllers or produce the control command directly,OmniJARVIS seeks a different path to ensure both strong reasoning and efficient decision-making capabilities via unified tokenization of multimodal interaction data. First, we introduce a self-supervised approach to learn a behavior encoder that produces discretized tokens for behavior trajectories $\tau = \{o_0, a_0, \dots\}$ and an imitation learning (IL) policy decoder conditioned on these tokens. These additional behavior tokens will be augmented to the vocabulary of pretrained MLMs. With this encoder, we then pack long-term multimodal interactions involving task instructions, memories, thoughts, observations, textual responses, behavior trajectories, \etc into unified token sequences and model them with autoregressive transformers. Thanks to the semantically meaningful behavior tokens, the resulting VLA model, OmniJARVIS, can reason (by producing chain-of-thoughts), plan, answer questions, and act (by producing behavior tokens for the IL policy decoder). OmniJARVIS demonstrates excellent performances on a comprehensive collection of atomic, programmatic, and open-ended tasks in open-world Minecraft. Our analysis further unveils the crucial design principles in interaction data formation, unified tokenization, and its scaling potentials.

OmniTokenizer: A Joint Image-Video Tokenizer for Visual Generation
Tokenizer, serving as a translator to map the intricate visual data into a compact latent space, lies at the core of visual generative models. Based on the finding that existing tokenizers are tailored to either image or video inputs, this paper presents OmniTokenizer, a transformer-based tokenizer for joint image and video tokenization. OmniTokenizer is designed with a spatial-temporal decoupled architecture, which integrates window attention and causal attention for spatial and temporal modeling, respectively. To exploit the complementary nature of image and video data, we further propose a progressive training strategy, where OmniTokenizer is first trained on image data on a fixed resolution to develop the spatial encoding capacity and then jointly trained on image and video data on multiple resolutions to learn the temporal dynamics. OmniTokenizer, for the first time, handles both image and video inputs within a unified framework and proves the possibility of realizing their synergy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction performance on various image and video datasets, e.g., 1.11 reconstruction FID on ImageNet and 42 reconstruction FVD on UCF-101, beating the previous SOTA methods by 13% and 26%, respectively. Additionally, we also show that when integrated with OmniTokenizer, both language model-based approaches and diffusion models can realize advanced visual synthesis performance, underscoring the superiority and versatility of our method.

On $f$-Divergence Principled Domain Adaptation: An Improved Framework
Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) plays a crucial role in addressing distribution shifts in machine learning. In this work, we improve the theoretical foundations of UDA proposed by Acuna et al. (2021)  by refining their $f$-divergence-based discrepancy and additionally introducing a new measure, $f$-domain discrepancy ($f$-DD). By removing the absolute value function and incorporating a scaling parameter, $f$-DD yields novel target error and sample complexity bounds, allowing us to recover previous KL-based results and bridging the gap between algorithms and theory presented in Acuna et al. (2021). Leveraging a localization technique, we also develop a fast-rate generalization bound. Empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of $f$-DD-based domain learning algorithms over previous works in popular UDA benchmarks.

On Affine Homotopy between Language Encoders
Pre-trained language encoders---functions that represent text as vectors---are an integral component of many NLP tasks. We tackle a natural question in language encoder analysis: What does it mean for two encoders to be similar? We contend that a faithful measure of similarity needs to be intrinsic, that is, task-independent, yet still be informative of extrinsic similarity---the performance on downstream tasks. It is common to consider two encoders similar if they are homotopic, i.e., if they can be aligned through some transformation. In this spirit, we study the properties of affine alignment of language encoders and its implications on extrinsic similarity. We find that while affine alignment is fundamentally an asymmetric notion of similarity, it is still informative of extrinsic similarity. We confirm this on a dataset of natural language representations. Beyond providing useful bounds on extrinsic similarity, intrinsic similarity also allows us to begin uncovering the structure of the space of pre-trained encoders by defining an order over them.

On Causal Discovery in the Presence of Deterministic Relations
Many causal discovery methods typically rely on the assumption of independent noise, yet real-life situations often involve deterministic relationships. In these cases, observed variables are represented as deterministic functions of their parental variables without noise.When determinism is present, constraint-based methods encounter challenges due to the violation of the faithfulness assumption. In this paper, we find, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, that score-based methods with exact search can naturally address the issues of deterministic relations under rather mild assumptions. Nonetheless, exact score-based methods can be computationally expensive. To enhance the efficiency and scalability, we develop a novel framework for causal discovery that can detect and handle deterministic relations, called Determinism-aware Greedy Equivalent Search (DGES). DGES comprises three phases: (1) identify minimal deterministic clusters (i.e., a minimal set of variables with deterministic relationships), (2) run modified Greedy Equivalent Search (GES) to obtain an initial graph, and (3) perform exact search exclusively on the deterministic cluster and its neighbors. The proposed DGES accommodates both linear and nonlinear causal relationships, as well as both continuous and discrete data types. Furthermore, we investigate the identifiability conditions of DGES. We conducted extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets to show the efficacy of our proposed method.

On Complexity of Teaching a Family of Linear Behavior Cloning Learners
We study optimal teaching for a family of Behavior Cloning learners that learn using a linear hypothesis class. In this setup, a knowledgeable teacher can demonstrate a dataset of state and action tuples, and is required to teach an optimal policy to an entire family of BC learners using smallest possible dataset. We analyse the linear family and design a novel teaching algorithm called `TIE' that achieves the instance optimal teaching complexity for the entire family. However, we show that this problem is NP-hard for action spaces with $|\mathcal{A}| > 2$ and provide an approximation algorithm with a $\log(|\mathcal{A}| - 1)$ guarantee on the optimal teaching size. We present empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIE algorithm compared to various baselines in different real-world teaching environments.

On Convergence of Adam for Stochastic Optimization under Relaxed Assumptions
In this paper, we  study Adam  in non-convex smooth scenarios with potential unbounded gradients and affine variance noise. We consider a general noise model which governs affine variance noise, bounded noise and sub-Gaussian noise. We show that Adam with the right parameter can find a stationary point with a $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(\log T)/\sqrt{T})$ rate in high probability under this general noise model where $T$ denotes total number iterations, matching the lower rate of stochastic first-order algorithms up to logarithm factors. We also provide a probabilistic convergence result for Adam under a generalized smooth condition which allows unbounded smoothness parameters and has been illustrated empirically to more accurately capture the smooth property of many practical objective functions.

On Divergence Measures for Training GFlowNets
Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized inference models designed to sample from unnormalized distributions over composable objects, with applications in generative modeling for tasks in fields such as causal discovery, NLP, and drug discovery. Traditionally, the training procedure for GFlowNets seeks to minimize the expected log-squared difference between a proposal (forward policy) and a target (backward policy) distribution, which enforces certain flow-matching conditions. While this training procedure is closely related to variational inference (VI), directly attempting standard Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization can lead to proven biased and potentially high-variance estimators. Therefore, we first review four divergence measures, namely, Renyi-$\alpha$'s, Tsallis-$\alpha$'s, reverse and forward KL's, and design statistically efficient estimators for their stochastic gradients in the context of training GFlowNets. Then, we verify that properly minimizing these divergences yields a provably correct and empirically effective training scheme, often leading to significantly faster convergence than previously proposed optimization. To achieve this, we design control variates based on the REINFORCE leave-one-out and score-matching estimators to reduce the variance of the learning objectives' gradients. Our work contributes by narrowing the gap between GFlowNets training and generalized variational approximations, paving the way for algorithmic ideas informed by the divergence minimization viewpoint.

One-Layer Transformer Provably Learns One-Nearest Neighbor In Context
Transformers have achieved great success in recent years. Interestingly, transformers have shown particularly strong in-context learning capability -- even without fine-tuning, they are still able to solve unseen tasks well purely based on task-specific prompts. In this paper, we study the capability of one-layer transformers in learning the one-nearest neighbor prediction rule. Under a theoretical framework where the prompt contains a sequence of labeled training data and unlabeled test data, we show that, although the loss function is nonconvex, when trained with gradient descent, a single softmax attention layer can successfully learn to behave like a one-nearest neighbor classifier. Our result gives a concrete example on how transformers can be trained to implement nonparametric machine learning algorithms, and sheds light on the role of softmax attention in transformer models.

One Sample Fits All: Approximating All Probabilistic Values Simultaneously and Efficiently
The concept of probabilistic values, such as Beta Shapley values and weighted Banzhaf values, has gained recent attention in applications like feature attribution and data valuation. However, exact computation of these values is often exponentially expensive, necessitating approximation techniques. Prior research has shown that the choice of probabilistic values significantly impacts downstream performance, with no universally superior option. Consequently, one may have to approximate multiple candidates and select the best-performing one. Although there have been many efforts to develop efficient estimators, none  are intended to approximate all probabilistic values both simultaneously and efficiently. In this work, we embark on the first exploration of achieving this goal. Adhering to the principle of maximum sample reuse, we propose a one-sample-fits-all framework parameterized by a sampling vector to approximate  intermediate terms that can be converted to any probabilistic value without amplifying  variance. Leveraging the concept of $ (\epsilon, \delta) $-approximation, we theoretically identify a key formula that effectively determines the convergence rate of our framework. By optimizing the sampling vector using this formula, we obtain i) a one-for-all estimator that achieves the currently best time complexity for all probabilistic values on average, and ii) a faster generic estimator with the sampling vector optimally tuned for each probabilistic value. Particularly, our one-for-all estimator achieves the fastest convergence rate on Beta Shapley values, including the well-known Shapley value, both theoretically and empirically. Finally, we establish a connection between probabilistic values and the least square regression used in datamodels, showing that our one-for-all estimator can also solve a family of datamodels simultaneously.

One-Step Diffusion Distillation through Score Implicit Matching
Despite their strong performances on many generative tasks, diffusion models require a large number of sampling steps in order to generate realistic samples.  This has motivated the community to develop effective methods to distill pre-trained diffusion models into more efficient models, but these methods still typically require few-step inference or perform substantially worse than the underlying model.  In this paper, we present Score Implicit Matching (SIM) a new approach to distilling pre-trained diffusion models into single-step generator models, while maintaining almost the same sample generation ability as the original model as well as being data-free with no need of training samples for distillation.  The method rests upon the fact that, although the traditional score-based loss is intractable to minimize for generator models, under certain conditions we can efficiently compute the gradients for a wide class of score-based divergences between a diffusion model and a generator. SIM shows strong empirical performances for one-step generators: on the CIFAR10 dataset, it achieves an FID of 2.17 for unconditional generation and 1.96 for class-conditional generation.  Moreover, by applying SIM to a leading transformer-based diffusion model, we distill a single-step generator for text-to-image (T2I) generation that attains an aesthetic score of 6.42 with no performance decline over the original multi-step counterpart, clearly outperforming the other one-step generators including SDXL-TURBO of 5.33, SDXL-LIGHTNING of 5.34 and HYPER-SDXL of 5.85. We will release this industry-ready one-step transformer-based T2I-generator along with this paper.

One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution
The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real-ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real-ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps. The source code will be released

One-to-Multiple: A Progressive Style Transfer Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Framework for Kidney Tumor Segmentation
In multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the accurate segmentation of the kidney and tumor based on traditional supervised methods typically necessitates detailed annotation for each sequence, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods can effectively mitigate inter-domain differences by aligning cross-modal features, thereby reducing the annotation burden. However, most existing UDA methods are limited to one-to-one domain adaptation, which tends to be inefficient and resource-intensive when faced with multi-target domain transfer tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient One-to-Multiple Progressive Style Transfer Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive (PSTUDA) framework for kidney and tumor segmentation in multi-sequence MRI. Specifically, we develop a multi-level style dictionary to explicitly store the style information of each target domain at various stages, which alleviates the burden of a single generator in a multi-target transfer task and enables effective decoupling of content and style. Concurrently, we employ multiple cascading style fusion modules that utilize point-wise instance normalization to progressively recombine content and style features, which enhances cross-modal alignment and structural consistency. Experiments conducted on the private MSKT and public KiTS19 datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PSTUDA over comparative methods in multi-sequence kidney and tumor segmentation. The average Dice Similarity Coefficients are increased by at least 1.8% and 3.9%, respectively. Impressively, our PSTUDA not only significantly reduces the floating-point computation by approximately 72% but also reduces the number of model parameters by about 50%, bringing higher efficiency and feasibility to practical clinical applications.

One-to-Normal: Anomaly Personalization for Few-shot Anomaly Detection
Traditional Anomaly Detection (AD) methods have predominantly relied on unsupervised learning from extensive normal data. Recent AD methods have evolved with the advent of large pre-trained vision-language models, enhancing few-shot anomaly detection capabilities. However, these latest AD methods still exhibit limitations in accuracy improvement. One contributing factor is their direct comparison of a query image's features with those of few-shot normal images. This direct comparison often leads to a loss of precision and complicates the extension of these techniques to more complex domains—an area that remains underexplored in a more refined and comprehensive manner. To address these limitations, we introduce the anomaly personalization method, which performs a personalized one-to-normal transformation of query images using an anomaly-free customized generation model, ensuring close alignment with the normal manifold. Moreover, to further enhance the stability and robustness of prediction results, we propose a triplet contrastive anomaly inference strategy, which incorporates a comprehensive comparison between the query and generated anomaly-free data pool and prompt information. Extensive evaluations across eleven datasets in three domains demonstrate our model's effectiveness compared to the latest AD methods. Additionally, our method has been proven to transfer flexibly to other AD methods, with the generated image data effectively improving the performance of other AD methods.

On Feature Learning in Structured State Space Models
Structured state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have recently been recognized as powerful alternatives to Transformer-based architectures, primarily due to their ability to model long contexts and efficiency during inference. This paper examines the scaling behavior of SSMs, an aspect previously unexplored. We focus on the capability of these models to learn features as their network width approaches infinity. Our findings reveal that established scaling rules like maximal update parameterization fail to support feature learning due to the non-representability of these models in the form of Tensor Programs. Additionally, we demonstrate that spectral scaling conditions, shown to be effective for feature learning in various architectures, do not hold the same implications for SSMs. Through a detailed analysis of signal propagation—both forward and backward—in SSMs, we identify the appropriate scaling necessary for non-trivial feature evolution in the infinite-width regime. Our proposed scaling shows behavior akin to maximal update parameterization, including the transfer of hyperparameters (HP) from smaller to larger scale SSMs.

On improved Conditioning Mechanisms and Pre-training Strategies for Diffusion Models
Large-scale training of latent diffusion models (LDMs) has enabled unprecedented quality in image generation. However, large-scale end-to-end training of these models is computationally costly, and hence most research  focuses either on finetuning  pretrained models or experiments at smaller scales.In this work we aim to improve the training efficiency and performance of LDMs with the goal of scaling to larger datasets and higher resolutions.We focus our study on two points that are critical for good performance and efficient training: (i) the mechanisms used for  semantic level (\eg a text prompt, or class name) and low-level (crop size, random flip, \etc) conditioning of the model, and (ii) pre-training strategies to transfer representations learned on smaller and lower-resolution datasets to larger ones.The main contributions of our work are the following: we present systematic experimental study of these points, we propose a novel conditioning mechanism that disentangles semantic and low-level conditioning, we obtain state-of-the-art performance  on CC12M for text-to-image at 512 resolution.

On Learning Multi-Modal Forgery Representation for Diffusion Generated Video Detection
Large numbers of synthesized videos from diffusion models pose a great threat to information security and authenticity, leading to an increasing demand for generated content detection. However, existing video-level detection algorithms mainly focus on deepfake manipulation, which fails on generated content from diffusion models. To push the advancement of video forensics, we propose an innovative Multi-Modal Forgery Representation (MMFR) to discriminate fake videos from real ones. This representation takes advantage of the generalizable multimodal space from Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to develop profound perceptive and comprehensive abilities. Based on the effective representation, we push forward the frontier of video forensics detection by proposing a powerful Transformer-based detector that integrates multimodal feature spaces. Aside from the generalizable MMFR feature space, the detector also introduces a novel In-and-Across Frame Attention to adopt spatial and temporal information as an auxiliary feature. In addition, we establish a high-quality dataset including videos generated from various diffusion-based algorithms. The evaluation of several benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of our detector on general content from unseen diffusion models.

Online Bayesian Persuasion Without a Clue
We study online Bayesian persuasion problems in which an informed sender repeatedly faces a receiver with the goal of influencing their behavior through the provision of payoff-relevant information. Previous works assume that the sender has knowledge about either the prior distribution over states of nature or receiver's utilities, or both. We relax such unrealistic assumptions by considering settings in which the sender does not know anything about the prior and the receiver. We design an algorithm that achieves sublinear---in the number of rounds T---regret with respect to an optimal signaling scheme, and we also provide a collection of lower bounds showing that the guarantees of such an algorithm are tight. Our algorithm works by searching a suitable space of signaling schemes in order to learn receiver's best responses. To do this, we leverage a non-standard representation of signaling schemes that allows to cleverly overcome the challenge of not knowing anything about the prior over states of nature and receiver's utilities. Finally, our results also allow to derive lower/upper bounds on the sample complexity of learning signaling schemes in a related Bayesian persuasion PAC-learning problem.

Online Budgeted Matching with General Bids
Online Budgeted Matching (OBM) is a classic problem with important applications in online advertising, online service matching, revenue management, and beyond. Traditional online algorithms typically assume a small bid setting, where the maximum bid-to-budget ratio ($\kappa$) is infinitesimally small. While recent algorithms have tried to address scenarios with non-small or general bids, they often rely on the Fractional Last Matching (FLM) assumption, which allows for accepting partial bids when the remaining budget is insufficient. This assumption, however, does not hold for many applications with indivisible bids. In this paper, we remove the FLM assumption and tackle the open problem of OBM with general bids. We first establish an upper bound of $1 −\kappa$  on the competitive ratio for any deterministic online algorithm. We then propose a novel meta algorithm,  called MetaAd, which reduces to different algorithms with first known provable competitive ratios parameterized by the maximum bid-to-budget ratio $\kappa \in [0, 1]$. As a by-product, we extend MetaAd to the FLM setting and get provable competitive algorithms. Finally, we apply our competitive analysis to the design learning-augmented algorithms.

Online Composite Optimization Between Stochastic and Adversarial Environments
We study online composite optimization under the Stochastically Extended Adversarial (SEA) model [Sachs et al., 2022]. Specifically, each loss function consists of two parts: a fixed non-smooth and convex regularizer, and a time-varying function which can be chosen either stochastically, adversarially, or in a manner that interpolates between the two extremes. In this setting, we show that for smooth and convex time-varying functions, optimistic composite mirror descent (OptCMD) can obtain an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sigma_{1:T}^2} + \sqrt{\Sigma_{1:T}^2})$ regret bound, where $\sigma_{1:T}^2$ and $\Sigma_{1:T}^2$ denote the cumulative stochastic variance and the cumulative adversarial variation of time-varying functions, respectively. For smooth and strongly convex time-varying functions, we establish an $\mathcal{O}((\sigma_{\max}^2 + \Sigma_{\max}^2)\log(\sigma_{1:T}^2 + \Sigma_{1:T}^2))$ regret bound, where $\sigma_{\max}^2$ and $\Sigma_{\max}^2$ denote the maximal stochastic variance and the maximal adversarial variation, respectively. For smooth and exp-concave time-varying functions, we achieve an $\mathcal{O}(d \log (\sigma_{1:T}^2 + \Sigma_{1:T}^2))$ bound where $d$ denotes the dimensionality. All our findings match existing bounds for the SEA model without the regularizer, which implies that there is \textit{no price} in regret bounds for the benefits gained from the regularizer. Moreover, to deal with the unknown function type in real-world problems, we propose a multi-level universal algorithm that is able to achieve the desirable bounds for three types of time-varying functions simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first universal algorithm that explicitly supports composite loss functions.

Online Consistency of the Nearest Neighbor Rule
In the realizable online setting, a learner is tasked with making predictions for a stream of instances, where the correct answer is revealed after each prediction. A learning rule is online consistent if its mistake rate eventually vanishes. The nearest neighbor rule is fundamental prediction strategy, but it is only known to be consistent under strong stochastic or geometric assumptions: the instances come i.i.d. or the label classes are well-separated. We prove online consistency for all measurable functions in doubling metric spaces under the mild assumption that instances are generated by a process that is uniformly absolutely continuous with respect to an underlying finite, upper doubling measure.

Online Control with Adversarial Disturbance for Continuous-time Linear Systems
We study online control for continuous-time linear systems with finite sampling rates, where the objective is to design an online procedure that learns under non-stochastic noise and performs comparably to a fixed optimal linear controller. We present a novel two-level online algorithm, by integrating a higher-level learning strategy and a lower-level feedback control strategy. This method offers a practical and robust solution for online control, which achieves sublinear regret. Our work provides the first nonasymptotic results for controlling continuous-time linear systems with finite number of interactions with the system. Moreover, we examine how to train an agent in domain randomization environments from a non-stochastic control perspective. By applying our method to the SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) algorithm, we achieved improved results in multiple reinforcement learning tasks within domain randomization environments. Our work provides new insights into non-asymptotic analyses of controlling continuous-time systems. Furthermore, our work brings practical intuition into controller learning under non-stochastic environments.

Online Convex Optimisation: The Optimal Switching Regret for all Segmentations Simultaneously
We consider the classic problem of online convex optimisation. Whereas the notion of static regret is relevant for stationary problems, the notion of switching regret is more appropriate for non-stationary problems. A switching regret is defined relative to any segmentation of the trial sequence, and is equal to the sum of the static regrets of each segment. In this paper we show that, perhaps surprisingly, we can achieve the asymptotically optimal switching regret on every possible segmentation simultaneously. Our algorithm for doing so is very efficient: having a space and per-trial time complexity that is logarithmic in the time-horizon. Our algorithm also obtains novel bounds on its dynamic regret: being adaptive to variations in the rate of change of the comparator sequence.

Online Feature Updates Improve Online (Generalized) Label Shift Adaptation
This paper addresses the prevalent issue of label shift in an online setting with missing labels, where data distributions change over time and obtaining timely labels is challenging. While existing methods primarily focus on adjusting or updating the final layer of a pre-trained classifier, we explore the untapped potential of enhancing feature representations using unlabeled data at test-time. Our novel method, Online Label Shift adaptation with Online Feature Updates (OLS-OFU), leverages self-supervised learning to refine the feature extraction process, thereby improving the prediction model. By carefully designing the algorithm, theoretically OLS-OFU maintains the similar online regret convergence to the results in the literature while taking the improved features into account.Empirically, it achieves substantial improvements over existing methods, which is as significant as the gains existing methods have over the baseline (i.e., without distribution shift adaptations).

Online Learning of Delayed Choices
Choice models are essential for understanding decision-making processes in domains like online advertising, product recommendations, and assortment optimization. The Multinomial Logit (MNL) model is particularly versatile in selecting products or advertisements for display. However, challenges arise with unknown MNL parameters and delayed feedback, requiring sellers to learn customers’ choice behavior and make dynamic decisions with biased knowledge due to delays. We address these challenges by developing an algorithm that handles delayed feedback, balancing exploration and exploitation using confidence bounds and optimism. We first consider a censored setting where a threshold for considering feedback is imposed by business requirements. Our algorithm demonstrates a $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{NT})$ regret, with a matching lower bound up to a logarithmic term. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to environments with non-thresholded delays, achieving a $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{NT})$ regret. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments that confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Online Posterior Sampling with a Diffusion Prior
Posterior sampling in contextual bandits with a Gaussian prior can be implemented exactly or approximately using the Laplace approximation. The Gaussian prior is computationally efficient but it cannot describe complex distributions. In this work, we propose approximate posterior sampling algorithms for contextual bandits with a diffusion model prior. The key idea is to sample from a chain of approximate conditional posteriors, one for each stage of the reverse process, which are estimated in a closed form using the Laplace approximation. Our approximations are motivated by posterior sampling with a Gaussian prior, and inherit its simplicity and efficiency. They are asymptotically consistent and perform well empirically on a variety of contextual bandit problems.

Online Relational Inference for Evolving Multi-agent Interacting System
We introduce a novel framework, Online Relational Inference (ORI), designed to efficiently identify hidden interaction graphs in evolving multi-agent interacting systems using streaming data. Unlike traditional offline methods that rely on a fixed training set, ORI employs online backpropagation, updating the model with each new data point, thereby allowing it to adapt to changing environments in real-time. A key innovation is the use of an adjacency matrix as a trainable parameter, optimized through a new adaptive learning rate technique called AdaRelation, which adjusts based on the historical sensitivity of the decoder to changes in the interaction graph. Additionally, a data augmentation method named Trajectory Mirror (TM) is introduced to improve generalization by exposing the model to varied trajectory patterns. Experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world data (CMU MoCap for human motion) demonstrate that ORI significantly improves the accuracy and adaptability of relational inference in dynamic settings compared to existing methods. This approach is model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with various neural relational inference (NRI) architectures, and offers a robust solution for real-time applications in complex, evolving systems.

Online Weighted Paging with Unknown Weights
Online paging is a fundamental problem in the field of online algorithms, in which one maintains a cache of $k$ slots as requests for fetching pages arrive online. In the weighted variant of this problem, each page has its own fetching cost; a substantial line of work on this problem culminated in an (optimal) $O(\log k)$-competitive randomized algorithm, due to Bansal, Buchbinder and Naor (FOCS'07).Existing work for weighted paging assumes that page weights are known in advance, which is not always the case in practice.For example, in multi-level caching architectures, the expected cost of fetching a memory block is a function of its probability of being in a mid-level cache rather than the main memory.This complex property cannot be predicted in advance; over time, however, one may glean information about page weights through sampling their fetching cost multiple times.We present the first algorithm for online weighted paging that does not know page weights in advance, but rather learns from weight samples.In terms of techniques, this requires providing (integral) samples to a fractional solver, requiring a delicate interface between this solver and the randomized rounding scheme; we believe that our work can inspire online algorithms to other problems that involve cost sampling.

Only Strict Saddles in the Energy Landscape of Predictive Coding Networks?
Predictive coding (PC) is a brain-inspired learning algorithm that performs local updates of network activities as well as weights.  Recent work has begun to study the properties of PC compared to backpropagation (BP) with gradient descent (GD), but its training dynamics still remain poorly understood. It is well known that the loss landscape of deep neural networks abounds with "non-strict" saddle points where the Hessian is positive semidefinite, which can lead to vanishing gradients and exponentially slow GD convergence. Here, we present theoretical and empirical evidence that the PC energy at the equilibrium of the network activities has only "strict" saddles with negative curvature. For deep linear networks, we prove that the saddle at the origin of the energy is strict, in contrast to the mean squared error (MSE) loss where it is non-strict for any network with more than one hidden layer. We support our theory with experiments on both linear and non-linear networks, showing that when initialised close to the origin, PC converges substantially faster than BP with stochastic GD. In addition, we prove that a set of non-strict saddles of the MSE other than the origin becomes strict in the equilibrated energy. Overall, these results highlight the higher robustness to initialisation of PC and raise further questions about the relationship between the loss and the energy landscape.

On Neural Networks as Infinite Tree-Structured Probabilistic Graphical Models
Deep neural networks (DNNs) lack the precise semantics and definitive probabilistic interpretation of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). In this paper, we propose an innovative solution by constructing infinite tree-structured PGMs that correspond exactly to neural networks. Our research reveals that DNNs, during forward propagation, indeed perform approximations of PGM inference that are precise in this alternative PGM structure. Not only does our research complement existing studies that describe neural networks as kernel machines or infinite-sized Gaussian processes, it also elucidates a more direct approximation that DNNs make to exact inference in PGMs. Potential benefits include improved pedagogy and interpretation of DNNs, and algorithms that can merge the strengths of PGMs and DNNs.

On provable privacy vulnerabilities of graph representations
Graph representation learning (GRL) is critical for extracting insights from complex network structures, but it also raises security concerns due to potential privacy vulnerabilities in these representations. This paper investigates the structural vulnerabilities in graph neural models where sensitive topological information can be inferred through edge reconstruction attacks. Our research primarily addresses the theoretical underpinnings of similarity-based edge reconstruction attacks (SERA), furnishing a non-asymptotic analysis of their reconstruction capacities. Moreover, we present empirical corroboration indicating that such attacks can perfectly reconstruct sparse graphs as graph size increases. Conversely, we establish that sparsity is a critical factor for SERA's effectiveness, as demonstrated through analysis and experiments on (dense) stochastic block models. Finally, we explore the resilience of private graph representations produced via noisy aggregation (NAG) mechanism against SERA. Through theoretical analysis and empirical assessments, we affirm the mitigation of SERA using NAG . In parallel, we also empirically delineate instances wherein SERA demonstrates both efficacy and deficiency in its capacity to function as an instrument for elucidating the trade-off between privacy and utility.

On Statistical Rates and Provably Efficient Criteria of Latent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)
We investigate the statistical and computational limits of latent **Di**ffusion **T**ransformers (**DiTs**) under the low-dimensional linear latent space assumption. Statistically, we study the universal approximation and sample complexity of the DiTs score function, as well as the distribution recovery property of the initial data. Specifically, under mild data assumptions, we derive an approximation error bound for the score network of latent DiTs, which is sub-linear in the latent space dimension. Additionally, we derive the corresponding sample complexity bound and show that the data distribution generated from the estimated score function converges toward a proximate area of the original one.Computationally, we characterize the hardness of both forward inference and backward computation of latent DiTs, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). For forward inference, we identify efficient criteria for all possible latent DiTs inference algorithms and showcase our theory by pushing the efficiency toward almost-linear time inference. For backward computation, we leverage the low-rank structure within the gradient computation of DiTs training for possible algorithmic speedup. Specifically, we show that such speedup achieves almost-linear time latent DiTs training by casting the DiTs gradient as a series of chained low-rank approximations with bounded error.Under the low-dimensional assumption, we show that the convergence rate and the computational efficiency are both dominated by the dimension of the subspace, suggesting that latent DiTs have the potential to bypass the challenges associated with the high dimensionality of initial data.

On the Ability of Developers' Training Data Preservation of Learnware
The learnware paradigm aims to enable users to leverage numerous existing well-trained models instead of building machine learning models from scratch. In this paradigm, developers worldwide can submit their well-trained models spontaneously into a learnware dock system, and the system helps developer generate specification for each model to form a learnware. As the key component, a specification should represent the capabilities of the model, enabling it to be adequately identified and reused, while preserving developer's original data. Recently, the reduced kernel mean embedding (RKME) specification was proposed and utilized as the foundation of learnware search algorithms and system construction. However, a theoretical analysis of the preservation ability of RKME specification for developer's training data remains open and challenging. In this paper, based on novel modeling and analysis, we prove that RKME specification can scarcely contain any of the developer's original data, and possess robust defense against common inference attacks, while preserving sufficient distribution information for effective learnware search.

On the cohesion and separability of average-link for hierarchical agglomerative clustering
Average-link is widely recognized as one of the most popular and effective methods for building hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The available theoretical analyses show that this method has a much better approximation than other popular heuristics, as single-linkage and complete-linkage, regarding variants of Dasgupta's cost function [STOC 2016]. However, these analyses do not separate average-link from a random hierarchy and they are not appealing for metric spaces since every hierarchical clustering has a $1/2$  approximation with regard to the variant of Dasgupta's functionthat is employed for dissimilarity measures [Moseley and Yang 2020]. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of \avglink \, in metric spaces, regarding several natural criteria that capture separability and cohesion, and are more interpretable than Dasgupta's cost function and its variants.  We also present experimental results with real datasets that, together with our theoretical analyses, suggest that average-link is a better choice than other related methods when both cohesion and separability are important goals.

On the Comparison between Multi-modal and Single-modal Contrastive Learning
Multimodal contrastive learning with language supervision has presented a paradigm shift in modern machine learning. By pre-training on a web-scale dataset, multimodal contrastive learning can learn high-quality representations that exhibit impressive robustness and transferability. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding is still in its infancy, especially about its comparison with single-modal contrastive learning. In this work, we introduce a feature learning theory framework that provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the differences between multimodal and single-modal contrastive learning. Based on a data generation model consisting of signal and noise, our analysis is performed on the ReLU network with the InfoMax objective function. Through a trajectory-based optimization analysis and generalization characterization on downstream tasks, we identify the critical factor, which is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), that impacts the generalizability in downstream tasks of both multimodal and single-modal contrastive learning. Through the cooperation between the two modalities, multimodal learning can achieve better feature learning, leading to improvements in performance in downstream tasks compared to single-modal learning. Our analysis provides a unified framework that can characterize the optimization and generalization of both single-modal and multimodal contrastive learning. Empirical simulations further confirm our theoretical conclusions.

On the Complexity of Learning Sparse Functions with Statistical and Gradient Queries
The goal of this paper is to investigate the complexity of gradient algorithms when learning sparse functions (juntas). We introduce a type of Statistical Queries ($\mathsf{SQ}$), which we call Differentiable Learning Queries ($\mathsf{DLQ}$), to model gradient queries on a specified loss with respect to an arbitrary model. We provide a tight characterization of the query complexity of $\mathsf{DLQ}$ for learning the support of a sparse function over generic product distributions in terms of a certain ``leap exponent'' of the target function (or distribution more generally). This complexity crucially depends on the loss function. For the squared loss, $\mathsf{DLQ}$ matches the complexity of Correlation Statistical Queries $(\mathsf{CSQ})$—potentially much worse than $\mathsf{SQ}$. On the other hand, for simple `generic’ loss functions such as the $\ell_1$ loss, $\mathsf{DLQ}$ always achieves the same complexity as $\mathsf{SQ}$. Finally, we provide evidence that $\mathsf{DLQ}$ can indeed capture learning with (stochastic) gradient descent by showing it correctly describes the complexity of learning with a two-layer neural network in the mean field regime and linear scaling.

On the Computational Landscape of Replicable Learning
We study computational aspects of algorithmic replicability, a notion of stability introduced by Impagliazzo, Lei,Pitassi, and Sorrell [STOC, 2022]. Motivated by a recent line of work that established strong statistical connections betweenreplicability and other notions of learnability such as online learning, private learning, and SQ learning, we aim tounderstand better the computational connections between replicability and these learning paradigms.Our first result shows that there is a concept class that is efficiently replicably PAC learnable, but, under standardcryptographic assumptions, no efficient online learner exists for this class. Subsequently, we design an efficientreplicable learner for PAC learning parities when the marginal distribution is far from uniform, making progress on aquestion posed by Impagliazzo et al. [STOC, 2022]. To obtain this result, we design a replicable lifting framework inspired byBlanc, Lange, Malik, and Tan [STOC, 2023], that transforms in a black-box manner efficient replicable PAC learners under theuniform marginal distribution over the Boolean hypercube to replicable PAC learners under any marginal distribution,with sample and time complexity that depends on a certain measure of the complexity of the distribution. Finally, we show that any pure DP learner can be transformed in a black-box manner to a replicable learner, with time complexity polynomial in the confidence and accuracy parameters, but exponential in the representation dimension of the underlying hypothesis class.

On the Curses of Future and History in Future-dependent Value Functions for Off-policy Evaluation
We study off-policy evaluation (OPE) in partially observable environments with complex observations, with the goal of developing estimators whose guarantee avoids exponential dependence on the horizon. While such estimators exist for MDPs and POMDPs can be converted to history-based MDPs, their estimation errors depend on the state-density ratio for MDPs which becomes history ratios after  conversion, an exponential object. Recently, Uehara et al. [2022a] proposed future-dependent value functions as a promising framework to address this issue, where the guarantee for memoryless policies depends on the density ratio over the latent state space. However, it also depends on the boundedness of the future-dependent value function and other related quantities, which we show could be exponential-in-length and thus erasing the advantage of the method. In this paper, we discover novel coverage assumptions tailored to the structure of POMDPs, such as outcome coverage and belief coverage, which enable polynomial bounds on the aforementioned quantities. As a side product, our analyses also lead to the discovery of new algorithms with complementary properties.

On the Efficiency of ERM in Feature Learning
Given a collection of feature maps indexed by a set $\mathcal{T}$, we study the performance of empirical risk minimization (ERM) on regression problems with square loss over the union of the linear classes induced by these feature maps. This setup aims at capturing feature learning, where the model is expected to jointly learn from the data an appropriate feature map as well as a linear predictor on top of it. We start by studying the asymptotic quantiles of the excess risk of ERM in this setting. Remarkably, we show that when there is a unique optimal feature map, these quantiles coincide, up to a factor of two, with those of the excess risk of the oracle procedure, which knows a priori this optimal feature map and deterministically outputs an empirical risk minimizer from the optimal linear class. We derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on the excess risk that captures a refined version of this phenomenon. Specifically, under a mild assumption, the upper bound we derive depends on the sample size $n$ as $C_{n}/n$, where $C_{n}$ is a sequence of monotonically decreasing distribution-dependent constants. Finally, we specialize our analysis to the case where the set $\mathcal{T}$ is finite, where we explicitly compute these constants in terms of moments of the feature maps and target as well as the size of $\mathcal{T}$.

On the Expressive Power of Tree-Structured Probabilistic Circuits
Probabilistic circuits (PCs) have emerged as a powerful framework compactly representing probability distributions for efficient and exact probabilistic inference. It has been shown that PCs with general directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure can be understood as a mixture of exponentially (in its height) many components, each of which is a product distributions over univariate marginals. However, existing structure learning algorithms for PCs often generate tree-structured circuits, or using tree-structured circuits as intermediate steps to compress them into DAG-structured circuits. This leads to an intriguing question on whether there exists an exponential gap between DAGs and trees for the PC structure.In this paper, we provide a negative answer to this conjecture by proving that, for $n$ variables, there is a sub-exponential upper bound $n^{O(\log n)}$ on the size of an equivalent tree computing the same probability distribution. On the other hand, we will also show that given a depth restriction on the tree, there is a super-polynomial separation between tree and DAG-structured PCs. Our work takes an important step towards understanding the expressive power of tree-structured PCs, and our techniques may be of independent interest in the study of structure learning algorithms for PCs.

On the Expressivity and Sample Complexity of Node-Individualized Graph Neural Networks
Graph neural networks (GNNs) employing message passing for graph classification are inherently limited by the expressive power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test for graph isomorphism. Node individualization schemes, which assign unique identifiers to nodes (e.g., by adding random noise to features), are a common approach for achieving universal expressiveness. However, the ability of GNNs endowed with individualization schemes to generalize beyond the training data is still an open question. To address this question, this paper presents a theoretical analysis of the sample complexity of such GNNs from a statistical learning perspective, employing Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension and covering number bounds. We demonstrate that node individualization schemes that are permutation-equivariant and robust to minor input perturbations result in lower sample complexity, and design novel individualization schemes that exploit these results. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated experimentally on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

On the Identifiability of Hybrid Physics-Neural Models: Meta-Learning as a Solution
The interest in leveraging physics-based inductive bias in deep learning has resulted in recent developments of _hybrid deep generative models (hybrid-DGMs)_ that integrates known physics-based mathematical expressions in neural generative models. The identification of these hybrid-DGMs often involves the inference of the parameters of the physics-based component along with its neural component. The identfiability of these hybrid-DGM however has not yet been theoretically probed or established. While the (un)identfiability of DGMs has been investigated, existing solutions often do not apply here as they require _observed_ auxiliary labels about the underlying hybrid models. This paper provides the first theoretical probe of the identfiability of hybrid-DGMs, and present meta-learning as a novel solution to construct identifiable hybrid-DGMs. On synthetic and real-data benchmarks, we further provide strong evidence for the un-identifiability of existing hybrid-DGMs using unconditional priors, and strong identifiability results of meta-hybrid-DGMs.

On the Impact of Feature Heterophily on Link Prediction with Graph Neural Networks
Heterophily, or the tendency of connected nodes in networks to have different class labels or dissimilar features, has been identified as challenging for many Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. While the challenges of applying GNNs for node classification when class labels display strong heterophily are well understood, it is unclear how heterophily affects GNN performance on other important graph learning tasks where class labels are not available. In this work, we focus on the link prediction task and systematically analyze the impact of heterophily in node features on GNN performance. Theoretically, we first introduce formal definitions of homophilic and heterophilic link prediction tasks, and present a theoretical framework that highlights the different optimizations needed for the respective tasks. We then analyze how different link prediction encoders and decoders adapt to varying levels of feature homophily and introduce designs for improved performance. Our empirical analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets confirms our theoretical insights and highlights the importance of adopting learnable decoders and GNN encoders with ego- and neighbor-embedding separation in message passing for link prediction tasks beyond homophily.

On the Implicit Bias of Predicting in Latent Space in Self Supervised Learning
Two competing paradigms exist for self-supervised learning of data representations.     Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) is a class of architectures in which semantically similar inputs are encoded into representations that are predictive of each other. A recent successful approach that falls under the JEPA framework is self-distillation, where an online encoder is trained to predict the output of the target encoder, sometimes with a lightweight predictor network. This is contrasted with the Masked Auto Encoder (MAE) paradigm, where an encoder and decoder are trained to reconstruct missing parts of the input in ambient space rather than its latent representation. A common motivation for using the JEPA approach over MAE is that the JEPA objective prioritizes abstract features over fine-grained pixel information (which can be unpredictable and uninformative).    In this work, we seek to understand the mechanism behind this empirical observation by analyzing deep linear models. We uncover a surprising mechanism: in a simplified linear setting where both approaches learn similar representations, JEPAs are biased to learn high influence features, or features characterized by having high regression coefficients. Our results point to a distinct implicit bias of predicting in latent space that may shed light on its success in practice.

On the Inductive Bias of Stacking Towards Improving Reasoning
Given the increasing scale of model sizes, novel training strategies like gradual stacking have garnered interest. Stacking enables efficient training by gradually growing the depth of a model in stages and using layers from a smaller model in an earlier stage to initialize the next stage. Although efficient for training, the model biases induced by such growing approaches is largely unexplored. In this work, we examine this fundamental aspect of gradual stacking, going beyond its efficiency benefits. We propose a variant of gradual stacking called MIDAS and discover an intriguing phenomenon for this approach: MIDAS is not only training efficient, but surprisingly also has an inductive bias towards improving downstream tasks, especially tasks that require reasoning abilities, despite having similar or slightly worse perplexity compared to baseline training. To further analyze this inductive bias, we construct {\em reasoning primitives} – simple synthetic tasks that are building blocks for reasoning – and find that a model pretrained with stacking is significantly better than standard pretraining on these primitives, with and without fine-tuning. This provides stronger and more robust evidence for this inductive bias towards reasoning. Furthermore, we conjecture the underlying reason for this inductive bias by exploring the connection of stacking to looped models and provide strong supporting empirical analysis.

On the Limitations of Fractal Dimension as a Measure of Generalization
Bounding and predicting the generalization gap of overparameterized neural networks remains a central open problem in theoretical machine learning. Neural network optimization trajectories have been proposed to possess fractal structure, leading to bounds and generalization measures based on notions of fractal dimension on these trajectories. Prominently, both the Hausdorff dimension and the persistent homology dimension have been proposed to correlate with generalization gap, thus serving as a measure of generalization. This work performs an extended evaluation of these topological generalization measures. We demonstrate that fractal dimension fails to predict generalization of models trained from poor initializations. We further identify that the $\ell^2$ norm of the final parameter iterate, one of the simplest complexity measures in learning theory, correlates more strongly with the generalization gap than these notions of fractal dimension. Finally, our study reveals the intriguing manifestation of model-wise double descent in persistent homology-based generalization measures. This work lays the ground for a deeper investigation of the causal relationships between fractal geometry, topological data analysis, and neural network optimization.

On the Noise Robustness of In-Context Learning for Text Generation
Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on downstream tasks by in-context learning (ICL), which heavily relies on the quality of demonstrations selected from a large set of annotated examples. Recent works claim that in-context learning is robust to noisy demonstrations in text classification. In this work, we show that, on text generation tasks, noisy annotations significantly hurt the performance of in-context learning. To circumvent the issue, we propose a simple and effective approach called Local Perplexity Ranking (LPR), which replaces the "noisy" candidates with their nearest neighbors that are more likely to be clean. Our method is motivated by analyzing the perplexity deviation caused by noisy labels and decomposing perplexity into inherent perplexity and matching perplexity. Our key idea behind LPR is thus to decouple the matching perplexity by performing the ranking among the neighbors in semantic space. Our approach can prevent the selected demonstrations from including mismatched input-label pairs while preserving the effectiveness of the original selection methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LPR, improving the EM score by up to 18.75 on common benchmarks with noisy annotations.

On the Optimality of Dilated Entropy and Lower Bounds for Online Learning in Extensive-Form Games
First-order methods (FOMs) are arguably the most scalable algorithms for equilibrium computation in large extensive-form games. To operationalize these methods, a distance-generating function, acting as a regularizer for the strategy space, must be chosen. The ratio between the strong convexity modulus and the diameter of the regularizer is a key parameter in the analysis of FOMs.A natural question is then: what is the optimal distance-generating function for extensive-form decision spaces? In this paper, we make a number of contributions, ultimately establishing that the weight-one dilated entropy (DilEnt) distance-generating function is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The DilEnt regularizer is notable due to its iterate-equivalence with Kernelized OMWU---the algorithm with state-of-the-art dependence on the game tree size in extensive-form games---when used in conjunction with the online mirror descent (OMD) algorithm. However, the standard analysis for OMD is unable to establish such a result; the only current analysis is by appealing to the iterate equivalence to KOMWU. We close this gap by introducing a pair of primal-dual treeplex norms, which we contend form the natural analytic viewpoint for studying the strong convexity of DilEnt. Using these norm pairs, we recover the diameter-to-strong-convexity ratio that predicts the same performance as KOMWU. Along with a new regret lower bound for online learning in sequence-form strategy spaces, we show that this ratio is nearly optimal.Finally, we showcase our analytic techniques by refining the analysis of Clairvoyant OMD when paired with DilEnt, establishing an $\mathcal{O}(n \log |\mathcal{V}| \log T/T)$ approximation rate to coarse correlated equilibrium in $n$-player games, where $|\mathcal{V}|$ is the number of reduced normal-form strategies of the players, establishing the new state of the art.

On the Parameter Identifiability of Partially Observed Linear Causal Models
Linear causal models are important tools for modeling causal dependencies and yet in practice, only a subset of the variables can be observed. In this paper,  we examine the parameter identifiability of these models by investigating whether the edge coefficients can be recovered given the causal structure and partially observed data. Our setting is more general than that of prior research—we allow all variables, including both observed and latent ones, to be flexibly related, and we consider the coefficients of all edges, whereas most existing works focus only on the edges between observed variables. Theoretically, we identify three types of indeterminacy for the parameters in partially observed linear causal models. We then provide graphical conditions that are sufficient for all parameters to be identifiable and show that some of them are provably necessary. Methodologically, we propose a novel likelihood-based parameter estimation method that addresses the variance indeterminacy of latent variables in a specific way and can asymptotically recover the underlying parameters up to trivial indeterminacy. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our identifiability theory and the effectiveness of the proposed method in the finite-sample regime.

On the Power of Small-size Graph Neural Networks for Linear Programming
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for addressing complex optimization problems. It has been theoretically demonstrated that GNNs can universally approximate the solution mapping functions of linear programming (LP) problems. However, these theoretical results typically require GNNs to have large parameter sizes. Conversely, empirical experiments have shown that relatively small GNNs can solve LPs effectively, revealing a significant discrepancy between theoretical predictions and practical observations. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a theoretical foundation for the effectiveness of small-size GNNs. We prove that polylogarithmic-depth, constant-width GNNs are sufficient to solve packing and covering LPs, two widely used classes of LPs. Our proof leverages the capability of GNNs to simulate a variant of the gradient descent algorithm on a carefully selected potential function. Additionally, we introduce a new GNN architecture, termed GD-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that GD-Net significantly outperforms conventional GNN structures while using fewer parameters.

On the Robustness of Spectral Algorithms for Semirandom Stochastic Block Models
In a graph bisection problem, we are given a graph $G$ with two equally-sized unlabeled communities, and the goal is to recover the vertices in these communities. A popular heuristic, known as spectral clustering, is to output an estimated community assignment based on the eigenvector corresponding to the second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of $G$. Spectral algorithms can be shown to provably recover the cluster structure for graphs generated from probabilistic models, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). However, spectral clustering is known to be non-robust to model mis-specification. Techniques based on semidefinite programming have been shown to be more robust, but they incur significant computational overheads. In this work, we study the robustness of spectral algorithms against semirandom adversaries. Informally, a semirandom adversary is allowed to ``helpfully'' change the specification of the model in a way that is consistent with the ground-truth solution. Our semirandom adversaries in particular are allowed to add edges inside clusters or increase the probability that an edge appears inside a cluster. Semirandom adversaries are a useful tool to determine the extent to which an algorithm has overfit to statistical assumptions on the input. On the positive side, we identify a wide range of semirandom adversaries under which spectral bisection using the _unnormalized_ Laplacian is strongly consistent, i.e., it exactly recovers the planted partitioning. On the negative side, we show that in many of these settings, _normalized_ spectral bisection outputs a partitioning that makes a classification mistake on a constant fraction of the vertices. Finally, we demonstrate numerical experiments that complement our theoretical findings.

On the Role of Attention Masks and LayerNorm in Transformers
Self-attention is the key mechanism of transformers, which are the essential building blocks of modern foundation models. Recent studies have shown that pure self-attention suffers from an increasing degree of rank collapse as depth increases, limiting model expressivity and further utilization of model depth. The existing literature on rank collapse, however, has mostly overlooked other critical components in transformers that may alleviate the rank collapse issue. In this paper, we provide a general analysis of rank collapse under self-attention, taking into account the effects of attention masks and layer normalization (LayerNorm). In particular, we find that although pure masked attention still suffers from exponential collapse to a rank one subspace, local masked attention can provably slow down the collapse rate. In the case of self-attention with LayerNorm, we first show that for certain classes of value matrices, collapse to a rank one subspace still happens exponentially. However, through construction of nontrivial counterexamples, we then establish that with proper choice of value matrices, a general class of sequences may not converge to a rank one subspace, and the self-attention dynamics with LayerNorm can simultaneously possess a rich set of equilibria with any possible rank between one and full. Our result refutes the previous hypothesis that LayerNorm plays no role in the rank collapse of self-attention and suggests that self-attention with LayerNorm constitutes a much more expressive, versatile nonlinear dynamical system than what was originally thought.

On the Saturation Effects of Spectral Algorithms in Large Dimensions
The saturation effects, which originally refer to the fact that kernel ridge regression (KRR) fails to achieve the information-theoretical lower bound when the regression function is over-smooth, have been observed for almost 20 years and were rigorously proved recently for kernel ridge regression and some other spectral algorithms over a fixed dimensional domain. The main focus of this paper is to explore the saturation effects for a large class of spectral algorithms (including the KRR, gradient descent, etc.) in large dimensional settings where $n \asymp d^{\gamma}$. More precisely, we first propose an improved minimax lower bound for the kernel regression problem in large dimensional settings and show that the gradient flow with early stopping strategy will result in an estimator achieving this lower bound (up to a logarithmic factor). Similar to the results in KRR, we can further determine the exact convergence rates (both upper and lower bounds) of a large class of (optimal tuned) spectral algorithms with different qualification $\tau$'s. In particular, we find that these exact rate curves (varying along $\gamma$) exhibit the periodic plateau behavior and the polynomial approximation barrier. Consequently, we can fully depict the saturation effects of the spectral algorithms and reveal a new phenomenon in large dimensional settings (i.e.,  the saturation effect occurs in large dimensional setting as long as the source condition $s>\tau$ while it occurs in fixed dimensional setting as long as $s>2\tau$).

On the Scalability of Certified Adversarial Robustness with Generated Data
Certified defenses against adversarial attacks offer formal guarantees on the robustness of a model, making them more reliable than empirical methods such as adversarial training, whose effectiveness is often later reduced by unseen attacks. Still, the limited certified robustness that is currently achievable has been a bottleneck for their practical adoption. Gowal et al. and Wang et al. have shown that generating additional training data using state-of-the-art diffusion models can considerably improve the robustness of adversarial training. In this work, we demonstrate that a similar approach can substantially improve deterministic certified defenses but also reveal notable differences in the scaling behavior between certified and empirical methods. In addition, we provide a list of recommendations to scale the robustness of certified training approaches. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art deterministic robustness certificates on CIFAR-10 for the $\ell_2$ ($\epsilon = 36/255$) and $\ell_{\infty}$ ($\epsilon = 8/255$) threat models, outperforming the previous results by $+3.95\%$ and $+1.39\%$, respectively. Furthermore, we report similar improvements for CIFAR-100.

On the Sparsity of the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
Considerable research efforts have recently been made to show that a random neural network $N$ contains subnetworks capable of accurately approximating any given neural network that is sufficiently smaller than $N$, without any training. This line of research, known as the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH), was originally motivated by the weaker Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which states that a sufficiently large random neural network $N$ contains sparse subnetworks that can be trained efficiently to achieve performance comparable to that of training the entire network $N$. Despite its original motivation, results on the SLTH have so far not provided any guarantee on the size of subnetworks. Such limitation is due to the nature of the main technical tool leveraged by these results, the Random Subset Sum (RSS) Problem. Informally, the RSS Problem asks how large a random i.i.d. sample $\Omega$ should be so that we are able to approximate any number in $[-1,1]$, up to an error of $\pm \epsilon$, as the sum of a suitable subset of $\Omega$. We provide the first proof of the SLTH in classical settings, such as dense and equivariant networks, with guarantees on the sparsity of the subnetworks. Central to our results, is the proof of an essentially tight bound on the Random Fixed-Size Subset Sum Problem (RFSS), a variant of the RSS Problem in which we only ask for subsets of a given size, which is of independent interest.

On the Stability and Generalization of Meta-Learning
We focus on developing a theoretical understanding of meta-learning. Given multiple tasks drawn i.i.d. from some (unknown) task distribution, the goal is to find a good pre-trained model that can be adapted to a new, previously unseen, task with little computational and statistical overhead. We introduce a novel notion of stability for meta-learning algorithms, namely *uniform meta-stability*. We instantiate two uniformly meta-stable learning algorithms based on regularized empirical risk minimization and gradient descent and give explicit generalization bounds for convex learning problems with smooth losses and for weakly convex learning problems with non-smooth losses. Finally, we extend our results to stochastic and adversarially robust variants of our meta-learning algorithm.

On the Target-kernel Alignment: a Unified Analysis with Kernel Complexity
This paper investigates the impact of alignment between the target function of interest and the kernel matrix on a variety of kernel-based methods based on a general loss belonging to a rich loss function family, which covers many commonly used methods in regression and classification problems. We consider the truncated kernel-based method (TKM) which is estimated within a reduced function space constructed by using the spectral truncation of the kernel matrix and compare its theoretical behavior to that of the standard kernel-based method (KM) under various settings. By using the kernel complexity function that quantifies the complexity of the induced function space, we derive the upper bounds for both TKM and KM, and further reveal their dependencies on the degree of target-kernel alignment. Specifically, for the alignment with polynomial decay, the established results indicate that under the just-aligned and weakly-aligned regimes, TKM and KM share the same learning rate. Yet, under the strongly-aligned regime, KM suffers the saturation effect, while TKM can be continuously improved as the alignment becomes stronger. This further implies that TKM has a strong ability to capture the strong alignment and provide a theoretically guaranteed solution to eliminate the phenomena of saturation effect. The minimax lower bound is also established for the squared loss to confirm the optimality of TKM. Extensive numerical experiments further support our theoretical findings.

On Tractable $\Phi$-Equilibria in Non-Concave Games
While Online Gradient Descent and other no-regret learning procedures are known to efficiently converge to a coarse correlated equilibrium in games where each agent's utility is concave in their own strategy, this is not the case when utilities are non-concave -- a common scenario in machine learning applications involving strategies parameterized by deep neural networks, or when agents' utilities are computed by neural networks, or both. Non-concave games introduce significant game-theoretic and optimization challenges: (i) Nash equilibria may not exist; (ii) local Nash equilibria, though existing, are intractable; and (iii) mixed Nash, correlated, and coarse correlated equilibria generally have infinite support and are intractable. To sidestep these challenges, we revisit the classical solution concept of $\Phi$-equilibria introduced by \citet{greenwald2003general}, which is guaranteed to exist for an arbitrary set of strategy modifications $\Phi$ even in non-concave games \citep{stoltz2007learning}. However, the tractability of $\Phi$-equilibria in such games remains elusive. In this paper, we initiate the study of tractable $\Phi$-equilibria in non-concave games and examine several natural families of strategy modifications. We show that when $\Phi$ is finite, there exists an efficient uncoupled learning algorithm that converges to the corresponding $\Phi$-equilibria. Additionally, we explore cases where $\Phi$ is infinite but consists of local modifications, showing that Online Gradient Descent can efficiently approximate $\Phi$-equilibria in non-trivial regimes.

Open-Book Neural Algorithmic Reasoning
Neural algorithmic reasoning is an emerging area of machine learning that focuses on building neural networks capable of solving complex algorithmic tasks. Recent advancements predominantly follow the standard supervised learning paradigm -- feeding an individual problem instance into the network each time and training it to approximate the execution steps of a classical algorithm. We challenge this mode and propose a novel open-book learning framework. In this framework, whether during training or testing, the network can access and utilize all instances in the training dataset when reasoning for a given instance.Empirical evaluation is conducted on the challenging CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark, which consists of 30 diverse algorithmic tasks. Our open-book learning framework exhibits a significant enhancement in neural reasoning capabilities. Further, we notice that there is recent literature suggesting that multi-task training on CLRS can improve the reasoning accuracy of certain tasks, implying intrinsic connections between different algorithmic tasks. We delve into this direction via the open-book framework. When the network reasons for a specific task, we enable it to aggregate information from training instances of other tasks in an attention-based manner. We show that this open-book attention mechanism offers insights into the inherent relationships among various tasks in the benchmark and provides a robust tool for interpretable multi-task training.

OpenDlign: Enhancing Open-World 3D Learning with Depth-Aligned Images
Recent open-world 3D representation learning methods using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align 3D data with image-text information have shown superior 3D zero-shot performance. However, CAD-rendered images for this alignment often lack realism and texture variation, compromising alignment robustness. Moreover, the volume discrepancy between 3D and 2D pretraining datasets highlights the need for effective strategies to transfer the representational abilities of VLMs to 3D learning. In this paper, we present OpenDlign, a novel open-world 3D model using depth-aligned images generated from a diffusion model for robust multimodal alignment. These images exhibit greater texture diversity than CAD renderings due to the stochastic nature of the diffusion model. By refining the depth map projection pipeline and designing depth-specific prompts, OpenDlign leverages rich knowledge in pre-trained VLM for 3D representation learning with streamlined fine-tuning. Our experiments show that OpenDlign achieves high zero-shot and few-shot performance on diverse 3D tasks, despite only fine-tuning 6 million parameters on a limited ShapeNet dataset. In zero-shot classification, OpenDlign surpasses previous models by 8.0% on ModelNet40 and 16.4% on OmniObject3D. Additionally, using depth-aligned images for multimodal alignment consistently enhances the performance of other state-of-the-art models.

OpenSatMap: A Fine-grained High-resolution Satellite Dataset for Large-scale Map Construction
In this paper, we propose OpenSatMap, a fine-grained, high-resolution satellite dataset for large-scale map construction. Map construction is one of the foundations of the transportation industry, such as navigation and autonomous driving. Extracting road structures from satellite images is an efficient way to construct large-scale maps. However, existing satellite datasets provide only coarse semantic-level labels with a relatively low resolution (up to level 19), impeding the advancement of this field. In contrast, the proposed OpenSatMap (1) has fine-grained instance-level annotations; (2) consists of high-resolution images (level 20); (3) is currently the largest one of its kind; (4) collects data with high diversity. Moreover, OpenSatMap covers and aligns with the popular nuScenes dataset and Argoverse 2 dataset to potentially advance autonomous driving technologies. By publishing and maintaining the dataset, we provide a high-quality benchmark for satellite-based map construction and downstream tasks like autonomous driving.

OPERA: Automatic Offline Policy Evaluation with Re-weighted Aggregates of Multiple Estimators
Offline policy evaluation (OPE) allows us to evaluate and estimate a new sequential decision-making policy's performance by leveraging historical interaction data collected from other policies. Evaluating a new policy online without a confident estimate of its performance can lead to costly, unsafe, or hazardous outcomes, especially in education and healthcare. Several OPE estimators have been proposed in the last decade, many of which have hyperparameters and require training. Unfortunately, choosing the best OPE algorithm for each task and domain is still unclear. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that adaptively blends a set of OPE estimators given a dataset without relying on an explicit selection using a statistical procedure. We prove that our estimator is consistent and satisfies several desirable properties for policy evaluation. Additionally, we demonstrate that when compared to alternative approaches, our estimator can be used to select higher-performing policies in healthcare and robotics. Our work contributes to improving ease of use for a general-purpose, estimator-agnostic, off-policy evaluation framework for offline RL.

Opponent Modeling based on Subgoal Inference
When an agent is in a multi-agent environment, it may face previously unseen opponents, and it is a challenge to cooperate with other agents to accomplish the task together or to maximize its own rewards. Most opponent modeling methods deal with the non-stationarity caused by unknown opponent policies via predicting the opponent’s actions. However, focusing on the opponent’s action is shortsighted, which also constrains the adaptability to unknown opponents in complex tasks. In this paper, we propose opponent modeling based on subgoal inference, which infers the opponent’s subgoals through historical trajectories. As subgoals are likely to be shared by different opponent policies, predicting subgoals can yield better generalization to unknown opponents. Additionally, we design two subgoal selection modes for cooperative games and general-sum games respectively. Empirically, we show that our method achieves more effective adaptation than existing methods in a variety of tasks.

Opponent Modeling with In-context Search
Opponent modeling is a longstanding research topic aimed at enhancing decision-making by modeling information about opponents in multi-agent environments. However, existing approaches often face challenges such as having difficulty generalizing to unknown opponent policies and conducting unstable performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach based on in-context learning and decision-time search named Opponent Modeling with In-context Search (OMIS). OMIS leverages in-context learning-based pretraining to train a Transformer model for decision-making. It consists of three in-context components: an actor learning best responses to opponent policies, an opponent imitator mimicking opponent actions, and a critic estimating state values. When testing in an environment features opponents with an unknown non-stationary policy, OMIS uses pretrained in-context components for decision-time search to refine the actor's policy. Theoretically, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, OMIS without search converges in opponent policy recognition and has good generalization properties; with search, OMIS provides improvement guarantees, exhibiting performance stability. Empirically, in competitive, cooperative, and mixed environments, OMIS demonstrates more effective and stable adaptation to opponents than other approaches.

OPS: Occupancy Prediction as A Sparse Set
Occupancy prediction, aiming at predicting the occupancy status within voxelized 3D environment, is quickly gaining momentum within the autonomous driving community. Mainstream occupancy prediction work first discretize the 3D environment into voxels, then perform classification on such dense grids. However, inspection on sample data reveals that the vast majority of voxels is unoccupied. Performing classification on these empty voxels demands suboptimal computation resource allocation, and reducing such empty voxels necessitates complex algorithm designs. To this end, we present a novel perspective on the occupancy prediction task: formulating it as a streamlined set prediction paradigm without the need for explicit space modeling or complex sparsification procedures. Our proposed framework, called OPS, utilizes a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to simultaneously predict occupied locations and classes using a set of learnable queries. Firstly, we employ the Chamfer distance loss to scale the set-to-set comparison problem to unprecedented magnitudes, making training such model end-to-end a reality. Subsequently, semantic classes are adaptively assigned using nearest neighbor search based on the learned locations. In addition, OPS incorporates a suite of non-trivial strategies to enhance model performances, including coarse-to-fine learning, consistent point sampling, and adaptive re-weighting, etc. Finally, compared with current state-of-the-art methods, our lightest model achieves superior RayIoU on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset at over 2x FPS, while our heaviest model surpasses previous best results by 4.9 RayIoU.  Code will be made public.

OptCM: The Optimization Consistency Models for Solving Combinatorial Problems in Few Shots
Diffusion models have recently advanced Combinatorial Optimization (CO) as a powerful backbone for neural solvers. However, their iterative sampling process requiring denoising across multiple noise levels incurs substantial overhead. We propose to learn direct mappings from different noise levels to the optimal solution for a given instance, facilitating high-quality generation with minimal shots. This is achieved through an optimization consistency training protocol, which, for a given instance, minimizes the difference among samples originating from varying generative trajectories and time steps relative to the optimal solution. The proposed Optimization Consistency Models (OptCM) enable fast single-step solution generation while retaining the option of multi-step sampling to trade for sampling quality, which offers a more effective and efficient alternative backbone for neural solvers. In addition, to mitigate the gap between training over historical instances and solving for the new instance, we additionally introduce a novel consistency-based gradient search scheme at test stage, for more effective exploration in the training-phase learned solution space. It is achieved by updating the latent solution probabilities under objective gradient guidance during the alternation of noise injection and denoising steps. Extensive experiments on two popular tasks, Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Maximal Independent Set (MIS), demonstrate the superiority of OptCM regarding both solution quality and efficiency, even outperforming LKH given limited time budgets. Notably, OptCM with merely one-step generation and one-step gradient search can mostly outperform the SOTA diffusion-based counterparts that require hundreds of steps, while achieving tens of times speedup.

Optical Diffusion Models for Image Generation
Diffusion models generate new samples by progressively decreasing the noise from the initially provided random distribution. This inference procedure generally utilizes a trained neural network numerous times to obtain the final output, creating significant latency and energy consumption on digital electronic hardware such as GPUs. In this study, we demonstrate that the propagation of a light beam through a transparent medium can be programmed to implement a denoising diffusion model on image samples. This framework projects noisy image patterns through passive diffractive optical layers, which collectively only transmit the predicted noise term in the image. The optical transparent layers, which are trained with an online training approach, backpropagating the error to the analytical model of the system, are passive and kept the same across different steps of denoising.  Hence this method enables high-speed image generation with minimal power consumption, benefiting from the bandwidth and energy efficiency of optical information processing.

Optimal ablation for model internals
Interpretability work often involves tracing the flow of information through machine learning models to identify the specific model components that perform relevant computations for tasks of interest. One important concept for localizing model behavior is component ablation, or simulating the removal of some model components to isolate specific causal relationships. Previous work simulates component removal with a variety of heuristic causal interventions, such as adding Gaussian noise or setting values to zeros or their means over an input distribution, to quantify the relative importance of various model components for performance on interpretable subtasks. We argue for the adoption of optimal ablation of activations for studying model internals and show that it has theoretical and empirical advantages over popular methods for component ablation. We show that optimal ablation can improve algorithmic circuit discovery---the identification of sparse subnetworks that recover low loss on interpretable subtasks---and produces tools that benefit other use cases related to model internals, including localization of factual recall and prediction with latent representations.

Optimal Aggregation of Prediction Intervals under Unsupervised Domain Shift
As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in dynamic environments, it becomes paramount to assess and quantify uncertainties associated with distribution shifts.A distribution shift occurs when the underlying data-generating process changes, leading to a deviation in the model's performance.The prediction interval, which captures the range of likely outcomes for a given prediction, serves as a crucial tool for characterizing uncertainties induced by their underlying distribution. In this paper, we propose methodologies for aggregating prediction intervals to obtain one with minimal width and adequate coverage on the target domain under unsupervised domain shift, under which we have labeled samples from a related source domain and unlabeled covariates from the target domain.Our analysis encompasses scenarios where the source and the target domain are related via i) a bounded density ratio, and ii) a measure-preserving transformation.Our proposed methodologies are computationally efficient and easy to implement. Beyond illustrating the performance of our method through a real-world dataset, we also delve into the theoretical details. This includes establishing rigorous theoretical guarantees, coupled with finite sample bounds, regarding the coverage and width of our prediction intervals. In essence, our approach excels in practical applications and is also underpinned by a solid theoretical framework, ensuring its reliability and effectiveness across diverse contexts.

Optimal Algorithms for Augmented Testing of Discrete Distributions
We consider the problem of hypothesis testing for discrete distributions. In the standard model, where we have sample access to an underlying distribution $p$, extensive research has established optimal bounds for identity testing (goodness of fit), closeness testing (equivalence or two-sample testing), and uniformity testing. We explore these problems in a setting where a predicted data distribution, possibly derived from historical data or predictive machine learning models, is available. We demonstrate that such a predictor can indeed reduce the number of samples required for all three property testing tasks. The reduction in sample complexity depends directly on the predictor’s quality, measured by its total variation distance from $p$. A key advantage of our algorithms is their adaptability to the precision of the prediction. Specifically, our algorithms can self-adjust their sample complexity based on the accuracy of the available prediction, operating without any any prior knowledge of the estimation’s accuracy (i.e. they are consistent). Additionally, we never use more samples than the standard approaches require, even if the predictions provide no meaningful information (i.e. they are also robust). We provide lower bounds to indicate that the improvements in sample complexity achieved by our algorithms are information-theoretically optimal. Furthermore, experimental results show that the performance of our algorithms on real data significantly exceeds our worst-case guarantees for sample complexity, demonstrating the practicality of our approach.

Optimal Algorithms for Learning Partitions with Faulty Oracles
We consider a clustering problem where a learner seeks to partition a finite set by querying a faulty oracle. This models applications where learners crowdsource information from non-expert human workers or conduct noisy experiments to determine group structure. The learner aims to exactly recover a partition by submitting queries of the form ``are $u$ and $v$ in the same group?'' for any pair of elements $u$ and $v$ in the set. Moreover, because the learner only has access to faulty sources of information, they require an error-tolerant algorithm for this task: i.e. they must fully recover the correct partition, even if up to $\ell$ answers are incorrect, for some error-tolerance parameter $\ell$. We study the question: for any given error-tolerance $\ell$, what is the minimum number of queries needed to learn a finite set partition of $n$ elements into $k$ groups? We design algorithms for this task and prove that they achieve optimal query complexity. To analyze our algorithms, we first highlight a novel connection between this task and correlation clustering. We then use this connection to build a R\'enyi-Ulam style analytical framework for this problem, which yields matching lower bounds. Our analysis also reveals an inherent asymmetry between the query complexity necessary to be robust against false negative errors as opposed to false positive errors.

Optimal Algorithms for Online Convex Optimization with Adversarial Constraints
A well-studied generalization of the standard online convex optimization (OCO) is constrained online convex optimization (COCO). In COCO, on every round, a convex cost function and a convex constraint function are revealed to the learner after the action for that round is chosen. The objective is to design an online policy that simultaneously achieves a small regret while ensuring a small cumulative constraint violation (CCV) against an adaptive adversary interacting over a horizon of length $T$. A long-standing open question in COCO is whether an online policy can simultaneously achieve $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $O(\sqrt{T})$ CCV without any restrictive assumptions. For the first time, we answer this in the affirmative and show that an online policy can simultaneously achieve $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ CCV. Furthermore, in the case of strongly convex cost and convex constraint functions, the regret guarantee can be improved to $O(\log T)$ while keeping the CCV bound the same as above. We establish these results by effectively combining the adaptive regret bound of the AdaGrad algorithm with Lyapunov optimization - a classic tool from control theory. Surprisingly, the analysis is short and elegant.

Optimal Batched Best Arm Identification
We study the batched best arm identification (BBAI) problem, where the learner's goal is to identify the best arm while switching the policy as less as possible. In particular, we aim to find the best arm with probability $1-\delta$ for some small constant $\delta>0$ while minimizing both the sample complexity (total number of arm pulls) and the batch complexity (total number of batches). We propose the three-batch best arm identification (Tri-BBAI) algorithm, which is the first batched algorithm that achieves the optimal sample complexity in the asymptotic setting (i.e., $\delta\rightarrow 0$) and runs in $3$ batches in expectation. Based on Tri-BBAI, we further propose the almost optimal batched best arm identification (Opt-BBAI) algorithm, which is the first algorithm that achieves the near-optimal sample and batch complexity in the non-asymptotic setting (i.e., $1/\delta$ is finite), while enjoying the same batch and sample complexity as Tri-BBAI when $\delta$ tends to zero. Moreover, in the non-asymptotic setting, the complexity of previous batch algorithms is usually conditioned on the event that the best arm is returned (with a probability of at least $1-\delta$), which is potentially unbounded in cases where a sub-optimal arm is returned. In contrast, the complexity of Opt-BBAI does not rely on such an event. This is achieved through a novel procedure that we design for checking whether the best arm is eliminated, which is of independent interest.

Optimal Classification under Performative Distribution Shift
Performative learning addresses the increasingly pervasive situations in which algorithmic decisions may induce changes in the data distribution as a consequence of their public deployment.  We propose a novel view in which these performative effects are modelled as push forward measures. This general framework encompasses existing models and enables novel performative gradient estimation methods, leading to more efficient and scalable learning strategies. For distribution shifts, unlike previous models which require full specification of the data distribution, we only assume knowledge of the shift operator that represents the performative changes. This approach can also be integrated into various change-of-variable-based models, such as VAEs or normalizing flows. Focusing on classification with a linear-in-parameters performative effect, we prove the convexity of the performative risk under a new set of assumptions. Notably, we do not limit the strength of performative effects but rather their direction, requiring only that classification becomes harder when deploying more accurate models. In this case, we also establish a connection with adversarially robust classification by reformulating the performative risk as a min-max variational problem. Finally, we illustrate our approach on synthetic and real datasets.

Optimal deep learning of holomorphic operators between Banach spaces
Operator learning problems arise in many key areas of scientific computing where Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are used to model physical systems. In such scenarios, the operators map between Banach or Hilbert spaces. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning operators between Banach spaces, in contrast to the vast majority of past works considering only Hilbert spaces. We focus on learning holomorphic operators -- an important class of problems with many applications. We combine arbitrary approximate encoders and decoders with standard feedforward Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures -- specifically, those with constant width exceeding the depth -- under standard $\ell^2$-loss minimization. We first identify a family of  DNNs such that the resulting Deep Learning (DL) procedure achieves optimal generalization bounds for such operators. For standard fully-connected architectures, we then show that there are uncountably many minimizers of the training problem that yield equivalent optimal performance. The DNN architectures we consider are `problem agnostic', with width and depth only depending on the amount of training data $m$ and not on regularity assumptions of the target operator. Next, we show that DL is optimal for this problem: no recovery procedure can surpass these generalization bounds up to log terms. Finally, we present numerical results demonstrating the practical performance on challenging problems including the parametric diffusion, Navier-Stokes-Brinkman and Boussinesq PDEs.

Optimal Design for Human Feedback
Learning of preference models from human feedback has been central to recent advances in artificial intelligence. Motivated by the cost of obtaining high-quality human annotations, we study the problem of data collection for learning preference models. The key idea in our work is to generalize the optimal design, a method for computing information gathering policies, to ranked lists. To show the generality of our ideas, we study both absolute and relative feedback on the lists. We design efficient algorithms for both settings and analyze them. We prove that our preference model estimators improve with more data and so does the ranking error under the estimators. Finally, we experiment with several synthetic and real-world datasets to show the statistical efficiency of our algorithms.

Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step
Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of Flow Matching (FM) methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the Optimal Transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for the fast integration (inference) of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative FM procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristics based on minibatch OT. To address these issues, we develop and theoretically justify the novel Optimal Flow Matching approach which allows recovering the straight OT displacement for the quadratic transport in just one FM step. The main idea of our approach is the employment of vector field for FM which are parameterized by convex functions.

Optimal Hypothesis Selection in (Almost) Linear Time
Hypothesis selection, also known as density estimation, is a fundamental problem in statistics and learning theory. Suppose we are given a sample set from an unknown distribution $P$ and a finite class of candidate distributions (called hypotheses) $\mathcal{H} \coloneqq \{H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_n\}$. The aim is to design an algorithm that selects a distribution $\hat H$ in  $\mathcal{H}$ that best fits the data. The algorithm's accuracy is measured based on the distance between $\hat{H}$ and $P$ compared to the distance of the closest distribution in $\mathcal{H}$ to $P$ (denoted by $OPT$). Concretely, we aim for $\|\hat{H} - P\|_{TV}$ to be at most $ \alpha \cdot OPT + \epsilon$ for some small $\epsilon$ and $\alpha$. While it is possible to decrease the value of $\epsilon$ as the number of samples increases, $\alpha$ is an inherent characteristic of the algorithm. In fact, one cannot hope to achieve $\alpha < 3$ even when there are only two candidate hypotheses, unless the number of samples is proportional to the domain size of $P$ [Bousquet, Kane, Moran '19]. Finding the best $\alpha$ has been one of the main focuses of studies of the problem since early work of [Devroye, Lugosi '01]. Prior to our work, no algorithm was known that achieves $\alpha = 3$ in near-linear time. We provide the first algorithm that operates in almost linear time ($\tilde{O}(n/\epsilon^3)$ time) and achieves $\alpha = 3$.  This result improves upon a long list of results in hypothesis selection. Previously known algorithms either had worse time complexity, a larger factor  $\alpha$, or extra assumptions about the problem setting.In addition to this algorithm, we provide another (almost) linear-time algorithm with better dependency on the additive accuracy parameter $\epsilon$, albeit with a slightly worse accuracy parameter, $\alpha = 4$.

Optimal Multiclass U-Calibration Error and Beyond
We consider the problem of online multiclass U-calibration, where a forecaster aims to make sequential distributional predictions over $K$ classes with low U-calibration error, that is, low regret with respect to all bounded proper losses simultaneously.    Kleinberg et al. (2023) developed an algorithm with U-calibration error $\mathcal{O}(K\sqrt{T})$ after $T$ rounds and raised the open question of what the optimal bound is.    We resolve this question by showing that the optimal U-calibration error is $\Theta(\sqrt{KT})$ --- we start with a simple observation that the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader algorithm of Daskalakis and Syrgkanis (2016) achieves this upper bound, followed by a matching lower bound constructed with a specific proper loss (which, as a side result, also proves the optimality of the algorithm of Daskalakis and Syrgkanis (2016) in the context of online learning against an adversary with finite choices).  We also strengthen our results under natural assumptions on the loss functions, including $\Theta(\log T)$ U-calibration error for Lipschitz proper losses, $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ U-calibration error for a certain class of decomposable proper losses, U-calibration error bounds for proper losses with a low covering number, and others.

Optimal Parallelization of Boosting
Recent works on the parallel complexity of boosting have established strong lower bounds on the tradeoff between the number of training rounds $p$ and the total parallel work per round $t$.These works have also presented highly non-trivial parallel algorithms that shed light on different regions of this tradeoff.Despite these advancements, a significant gap persists between the theoretical lower bounds and the performance of these algorithms across much of the tradeoff space.In this work, we essentially close this gap by providing both improved lower bounds on the parallel complexity of weak-to-strong learners, and a parallel boosting algorithm whose performance matches these bounds across the entire $p$ vs.~$t$ compromise spectrum, up to logarithmic factors.Ultimately, this work settles the true parallel complexity of boosting algorithms.

Optimal Rates for Vector-Valued Spectral Regularization Learning Algorithms
We study theoretical properties of a broad class of regularized algorithms with vector-valued output. These spectral algorithms include kernel ridge regression, kernel principal component regression, various implementations of gradient descent and many more. Our contributions are twofold. First, we rigorously confirm the so-called saturation effect for ridge regression with vector-valued output by deriving a novel lower bound on learning rates; this bound is shown to be suboptimal when the smoothness of the regression function exceeds a certain level. Second, we present the upper bound for the finite sample risk general vector-valued spectral algorithms, applicable to both well-specified and misspecified scenarios (where the true regression function lies outside of the hypothesis space) which is minimax optimal in various regimes. All of our results explicitly allow the case of infinite-dimensional output variables, proving consistency of recent practical applications.

Optimal Transport-based Labor-free Text Prompt Modeling for Sketch Re-identification
Sketch Re-identification (Sketch Re-ID), which aims to accurately identify persons of interest from images captured by surveillance cameras using hand-drawn sketches, is crucial for criminal investigation, law enforcement, and missing person searches. Existing methods focus on alleviating the modality gap using semantic metrics, such as cross-entropy loss. However, fine-grained but modality-consistent information unfortunately becomes misaligned due to the inherent abstract nature of sketches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel $\textit{Optimal Transport-based Labor-free Text Prompt Modeling}$ (OLTM) network, which hierarchically extracts coarse- and fine-grained similarity representations guided by textual semantic information without any additional annotations. Specifically, a text prompt alignment module is well-designed, so that both fixed and learnable prompts on various person attributes are generated. Subsequently, an optimal transport algorithm is introduced to dig out interested local text representation, which plays a bridge to extract the consistent but semantic features from both sketch and image modalities. Additionally, instead of measuring the similarity of two samples by only computing their distance, a novel triplet assignment loss is further proposed, in which the whole data distribution also contributes to optimizing the inter/intra-class distances. Extensive experiments conducted on two public benchmarks consistently demonstrate the robustness and superiority of our OLTM over state-of-the-art methods.

Optimistic Verifiable Training by Controlling Hardware Nondeterminism
The increasing compute demands of AI systems has led to the emergence of services that train models on behalf of clients lacking necessary resources. However, ensuring correctness of training and guarding against potential training-time attacks, such as data poisoning and backdoors, poses challenges. Existing works on verifiable training largely fall into two classes: proof-based systems, which can be difficult to scale, and ``optimistic'' methods that consider a trusted third-party auditor who replicates the training process. A key challenge with the latter is that hardware nondeterminism between GPU types during training prevents an auditor from replicating the training process exactly, and such schemes are therefore non-robust. We propose a method that combines training in a higher precision than the target model, rounding after intermediate computation steps, and storing rounding decisions based on an adaptive thresholding procedure, to successfully control for  nondeterminism. Across three different NVIDIA GPUs (A40, Titan XP, RTX 2080 Ti), we achieve exact training replication at FP32 precision for both full-training and fine-tuning of ResNet-50 (23M) and GPT-2 (117M) models. Our  verifiable training scheme significantly decreases the storage and time costs compared to proof-based systems.

Optimization Can Learn Johnson Lindenstrauss Embeddings
Embeddings play a pivotal role across various disciplines, offering compact representations of complex data structures. Randomized methods like Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) provide state-of-the-art and essentially unimprovable theoretical guarantees for achieving such representations. These guarantees are worst-case and in particular, neither the analysis, ${\textit{nor the algorithm}}$, takes into account any potential structural information of the data. The natural question is: must we randomize? Could we instead use an optimization-based approach, working directly with the data? A first answer is no: as we show, the distance-preserving objective of JL has a non-convex landscape over the space of projection matrices, with many bad stationary points. But this is not the final answer. We present a novel method motivated by diffusion models, that circumvents this fundamental challenge: rather than performing optimization directly over the space of projection matrices, we use optimization over the larger space of $\textit{random solution samplers}$, gradually reducing the variance of the sampler. We show that by moving through this larger space, our objective converges to a deterministic (zero variance) solution, avoiding bad stationary points. This method can also be seen as an optimization-based derandomization approach, and is an idea and method that we believe can be applied to many other problems.

Optimization Efficient Open-World Visual Region Recognition
Understanding the semantics of individual regions or patches of unconstrained images, such as open-world object detection, remains a critical yet challenging task in computer vision. Building on the success of powerful image-level vision-language (ViL) foundation models like CLIP, recent efforts have sought to harness their capabilities by either training a contrastive model from scratch with an extensive collection of region-label pairs or aligning the outputs of a detection model with image-level representations of region proposals. Despite notable progress, these approaches are plagued by computationally intensive training requirements, susceptibility to data noise, and deficiency in contextual information. To address these limitations, we explore the synergistic potential of off-the-shelf foundation models, leveraging their respective strengths in localization and semantics. We introduce a novel, generic, and efficient architecture, named RegionSpot, designed to integrate position-aware localization knowledge from a localization foundation model (e.g., SAM) with semantic information from a ViL model (e.g., CLIP). To fully exploit pretrained knowledge while minimizing training overhead, we keep both foundation models frozen, focusing optimization efforts solely on a lightweight attention-based knowledge integration module.Extensive experiments in open-world object recognition show that our  RegionSpot achieves significant performance gain over prior alternatives, along with substantial computational savings (e.g., training our model with 3 million data in a single day using 8 V100 GPUs). RegionSpot outperforms GLIP-L by 2.9 in mAP on LVIS val set,  with an even larger margin of 13.1 AP for more challenging and rare categories, and a 2.5 AP increase on ODinW. Furthermore, it exceeds GroundingDINO-L by 11.0 AP for rare categories on the LVIS minival set.

Ordering-Based Causal Discovery for Linear and Nonlinear Relations
Identifying causal relations from purely observational data typically requires additional assumptions on relations and/or noise. Most current methods restrict their analysis to datasets that are assumed to have pure linear or nonlinear relations, which is often not reflective of real-world datasets that contain a combination of both. This paper presents CaPS, an ordering-based causal discovery algorithm that effectively handles linear and nonlinear relations. CaPS introduces a novel identification criterion for topological ordering and incorporates the concept of "parent score" during the post-processing optimization stage. These scores quantify the strength of the average causal effect, helping to accelerate the pruning process and correct inaccurate predictions in the pruning step. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solutions outperform state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data with varying ratios of linear and nonlinear relations. The results obtained from real-world data also support the competitiveness of CaPS.

Outlier-Robust Distributionally Robust Optimization via Unbalanced Optimal Transport
Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) deals with uncertainty in data distributions by optimizing the model performance against the worst possible distribution within an ambiguity set. In this paper, we propose a DRO framework that relies on a new distance inspired by Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT). The designed UOT distance employs a soft penalization term instead of hard constraints, enabling the construction of an ambiguity set that is more resilient to outliers.  Under smoothness conditions, we establish strong duality for the proposed DRO problem. Moreover, we introduce a computationally efficient Lagrangian penalty formulation for which we also show that strong duality holds. Finally, we provide empirical results that demonstrate that our method offers improved robustness to outliers and is computationally less demanding for regression and classification tasks.

Out-of-Distribution Detection with a Single Unconditional Diffusion Model
Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning that seeks to identify abnormal samples. Traditionally, unsupervised methods utilize a deep generative model for OOD detection. However, such approaches necessitate a different model when evaluating abnormality against a new distribution. With the emergence of foundational generative models, this paper explores whether a single generalist model can also perform OOD detection across diverse tasks. To that end, we introduce our method, Diffusion Paths, (DiffPath) in this work. DiffPath proposes to utilize a single diffusion model originally trained to perform unconditional generation for OOD detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel technique of measuring the rate-of-change and curvature of the diffusion paths connecting samples to the standard normal. Extensive experiments show that with a single model, DiffPath outperforms prior work on a variety of OOD tasks involving different distributions.

Overcoming Brittleness in Pareto-Optimal Learning Augmented Algorithms
The study of online algorithms with machine-learned predictions has gained considerable prominence in recent years. One of the common objectives in the design and analysis of such algorithms is to attain (Pareto) optimal tradeoffs between the {\em consistency} of the algorithm, i.e., its performance assuming perfect predictions, and its {\em robustness}, i.e., the performance of the algorithm under adversarial predictions. In this work, we demonstrate that this optimization criterion can be extremely brittle, in that the performance of Pareto-optimal algorithms may degrade dramatically even in the presence of imperceptive prediction error. To remedy this drawback, we propose a new framework in which the smoothness in the performance of the algorithm is enforced by means of a {\em user-specified profile}. This allows us to regulate the performance of the algorithm as a function of the prediction error, while simultaneouslymaintaining the analytical notion of consistency/robustness tradeoffs, adapted to the profile setting. We apply this new approach to a well-studied online problem, namely the {\em one-way trading} problem. For this problem, we further address another limitation of the state-of-the-art Pareto-optimal algorithms, namely the fact that they are tailored to worst-case, and extremely pessimistic inputs. We propose a new Pareto-optimal algorithm that leverages any deviation from the worst-case input to its benefit, and introduce a new metric that allows us to compare any two Pareto-optimal algorithms via a {\em dominance} relation.

Overcoming Common Flaws in the Evaluation of Selective Classification Systems
Selective Classification, wherein models can reject low-confidence predictions, promises reliable translation of machine-learning based classification systems to real-world scenarios such as clinical diagnostics. While current evaluation of these systems typically assumes fixed working points based on pre-defined rejection thresholds, methodological progress requires benchmarking the general performance of systems akin to the $\mathrm{AUROC}$ in standard classification. In this work, we define 5 requirements for multi-threshold metrics in selective classification regarding task alignment, interpretability, and flexibility, and show how current approaches fail to meet them. We propose the Area under the Generalized Risk Coverage curve ($\mathrm{AUGRC}$), which meets all requirements and can be directly interpreted as the average risk of undetected failures. We empirically demonstrate the relevance of $\mathrm{AUGRC}$ on a comprehensive benchmark spanning 6 data sets and 13 confidence scoring functions. We find that the proposed metric substantially changes metric rankings on 5 out of the 6 data sets.

Overfitting Behaviour of Gaussian Kernel Ridge Regression: Varying Bandwidth or Dimensionality
We consider the overfitting behavior of minimum norm interpolating solutions of Gaussian kernel ridge regression (i.e. kernel ridgeless regression), when the bandwidth or input dimension varies with the sample size. For fixed dimensions, we show that even with varying or tuned bandwidth, the ridgeless solution is never consistent and we argue that it is always worse than the null predictor. For increasing dimension, we give a generic characterization of the overfitting behavior for any scaling of the dimension with sample size. We use this to provide the first example of benign overfitting using the Gaussian kernel with sub-polynomial scaling dimension.  All our results are under the Gaussian universality ansatz and the (non-rigorous) risk predictions in terms of the kernel eigenstructure.

Over-parameterized Student Model via Tensor Decomposition Boosted Knowledge Distillation
Increased training parameters have enabled large pre-trained models to excel in various downstream tasks. Nevertheless, the extensive computational requirements associated with these models hinder their widespread adoption within the community. We focus on Knowledge Distillation (KD), where a compact student model is trained to mimic a larger teacher model, facilitating the transfer of knowledge of large models. In contrast to much of the previous work, we scale up the parameters of the student model during training, to benefit from over-parameterization without increasing the inference latency. In particular, we propose a tensor decomposition strategy that effectively over-parameterizes the relatively small student model through an efficient and nearly lossless decomposition of its parameter matrices into higher-dimensional tensors. To ensure efficiency, we further introduce a tensor constraint loss to align the high-dimensional tensors between the student and teacher models. Comprehensive experiments validate the significant performance enhancement by our approach in various KD tasks, covering computer vision and natural language processing areas. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/anonymize_opdf-2171/.

OwMatch: Conditional Self-Labeling with Consistency for Open-world Semi-Supervised Learning
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a robust framework for harnessing the potential of unannotated data. Traditionally, SSL mandates that all classes possess labels. However, the emergence of open-world SSL (OwSSL) introduces a more practical challenge, wherein unlabeled data may encompass samples from unseen classes. This scenario leads to misclassification of unseen classes as known ones, consequently undermining classification accuracy. To overcome this challenge, this study revisits two methodologies from self-supervised and semi-supervised learning, self-labeling and consistency, tailoring them to address the OwSSL problem. Specifically, we propose an effective framework called _OwMatch_, combining conditional self-labeling and open-world hierarchical thresholding.  Theoretically, we analyze the estimation of class distribution on unlabeled data through rigorous statistical analysis, thus demonstrating that OwMatch can ensure the unbiasedness of the label assignment estimator with reliability.  Comprehensive empirical analyses demonstrate that our method yields substantial performance enhancements across both known and unknown classes in comparison to previous studies.

OW-VISCapTor: Abstractors for Open-World Video Instance Segmentation and Captioning
We propose the new task open-world video instance segmentation and captioning. It requires to detect, segment, track and describe with rich captions never before seen objects. This challenging task can be addressed by developing "abstractors" which connect a vision model and a language foundation model. Concretely, we connect a multi-scale visual feature extractor and a large language model (LLM) by developing an object abstractor and an object-to-text abstractor. The object abstractor, consisting of a prompt encoder and transformer blocks, introduces spatially-diverse open-world object queries to discover never before seen objects in videos. An inter-query contrastive loss further encourages the diversity of object queries. The object-to-text abstractor is augmented with masked-cross attention and acts as a bridge between the object queries and a frozen LLM to generate rich and descriptive object-centric captions for each detected object. Our generalized approach surpasses the baseline that jointly addresses the tasks of open-world video instance segmentation and dense video object captioning by 13% on never before seen objects, and by 10% on object-centric captions.

PAC-Bayes-Chernoff bounds for unbounded losses
We introduce a new PAC-Bayes oracle bound for unbounded losses that extends Cramér-Chernoff bounds to the PAC-Bayesian setting. The proof technique relies on controlling the tails of certain random variables involving the Cramér transform of the loss. Our approach naturally leverages properties of Cramér-Chernoff bounds, such as exact optimization of the free parameter in many PAC-Bayes bounds. We highlight several applications of the main theorem. Firstly, we show that our bound recovers and generalizes previous results. Additionally, our approach allows working with richer assumptions that result in more informative and potentially tighter bounds. In this direction, we provide a general bound under a new *model-dependent* assumption from which we obtain bounds based on parameter norms and log-Sobolev inequalities. Notably, many of these bounds can be minimized to obtain distributions beyond the Gibbs posterior and provide novel theoretical coverage to existing regularization techniques.

PACE: marrying the generalization of PArameter-efficient fine-tuning with Consistency rEgularization
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) effectively adapts pre-trained vision transformers to downstream tasks. However, the optimization for tasks performance often comes at the cost of generalizability in fine-tuned models. To address this issue, we theoretically connect smaller weight gradient norms during training and larger datasets to the improved model generalization. Motivated by this connection, we propose reducing gradient norms for enhanced generalization and aligning fine-tuned model with the pre-trained counterpart to retain knowledge from large-scale pre-training data. Yet, naive alignment does not guarantee gradient reduction and can potentially cause gradient explosion, complicating efforts to manage gradients. To address such issues, we propose PACE, marrying generalization of PArameter-efficient fine-tuning with Consistency rEgularization. We perturb features learned from the adapter with the multiplicative noise and ensure the fine-tuned model remains consistent for same sample under different perturbations. Theoretical analysis shows that PACE not only implicitly regularizes gradients for enhanced generalization, but also implicitly aligns the fine-tuned and pre-trained models to retain knowledge. Experimental evidence supports our theories. PACE outperforms existing PEFT methods in four visual adaptation tasks: VTAB-1k, FGVC, few-shot learning and domain adaptation. Code will be released upon acceptance.

PaGoDA: Progressive Growing of a One-Step Generator from a Low-Resolution Diffusion Teacher
To accelerate sampling, diffusion models (DMs) are often distilled into generators that directly map noise to data in a single step. In this approach, the resolution of the generator is fundamentally limited by that of the teacher DM. To overcome this limitation, we propose Progressive Growing of Diffusion Autoencoder (PaGoDA), a technique to progressively grow the resolution of the generator beyond that of the original teacher DM. Our key insight is that a pre-trained, low-resolution DM can be used to deterministically encode high-resolution data to a structured latent space by solving the PF-ODE forward in time (data-to-noise), starting from an appropriately down-sampled image. Using this frozen encoder in an auto-encoder framework, we train a decoder by progressively growing its resolution. From the nature of progressively growing decoder, PaGoDA avoids re-training teacher/student models when we upsample the student model, making the whole training pipeline much cheaper. In experiments, we used our progressively growing decoder to upsample from the pre-trained model's 64x64 resolution to generate 512x512 samples, achieving 2x faster inference compared to single-step distilled Stable Diffusion like LCM. PaGoDA also achieved state-of-the-art FIDs on ImageNet across all resolutions from 64x64 to 512x512. Additionally, we demonstrated PaGoDA's effectiveness in solving inverse problems and enabling controllable generation.

ParallelEdits: Efficient Multi-Aspect Text-Driven Image Editing with Attention Grouping
Text-driven image synthesis has made significant advancements with the development of diffusion models, transforming how visual content is generated from text prompts. Despite these advances, text-driven image editing, a key area in computer graphics, faces unique challenges. A major challenge is making simultaneous edits across multiple objects or attributes. Applying these methods sequentially for multi-attribute edits increases computational demands and efficiency losses.     In this paper, we address these challenges with significant contributions. Our main contribution is the development of ParallelEdits, a method that seamlessly manages simultaneous edits across multiple attributes. In contrast to previous approaches, ParallelEdits not only preserves the quality of single attribute edits but also significantly improves the performance of multitasking edits. This is achieved through innovative attention distribution mechanism and multi-branch design that operates across several processing heads.     Additionally, we introduce the PIE-Bench++ dataset, an expansion of the original PIE-Bench dataset, to better support evaluating image-editing tasks involving multiple objects and attributes simultaneously. This dataset is a benchmark for evaluating text-driven image editing methods in multifaceted scenarios.

Parameterized Approximation Schemes for Fair-Range Clustering
Fair-range clustering extends classical clustering formulations by associating each data point with one or several demographic labels. It imposes lower and upper bound constraints on the number of opened facilities associated with each label, ensuring fair representation of all demographic groups by the opened facilities. In this paper we focus on the fair-range $k$-median and $k$-means problems in Euclidean spaces. We give $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms with fixed-parameter tractable running times for both problems, parameterized by the numbers of opened facilities and demographic labels. For Euclidean metrics, these are the first parameterized approximation schemes for the problems, improving upon the previously known parameterized approximation ratios of $1+2e^{-1}+\varepsilon$ for fair-range $k$-median and $1+8e^{-1}+\varepsilon$ for fair-range $k$-means obtained in a simpler case considering only the lower bound constraint.

Parametric model reduction of mean-field and stochastic systems via higher-order action matching
The aim of this work is to learn models of population dynamics of physical systems that feature stochastic and mean-field effects and that depend on physics parameters. The learned models can act as surrogates of classical numerical models to efficiently predict the system behavior over the physics parameters. Building on the Benamou-Brenier formula from optimal transport and action matching, we use a variational problem to infer parameter- and time-dependent gradient fields that represent approximations of the population dynamics. The inferred gradient fields can then be used to rapidly generate sample trajectories that mimic the dynamics of the physical system on a population level over varying physics parameters. We show that combining Monte Carlo sampling with higher-order quadrature rules is critical for accurately estimating the training objective from sample data and for stabilizing the training process. We demonstrate on Vlasov-Poisson instabilities as well as on high-dimensional particle and chaotic systems that our approach accurately predicts population dynamics over a wide range of parameters and outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based modeling that simply condition on time and physics parameters.

Partial Transportability for Domain Generalization
A fundamental task in AI is providing performance guarantees for predictions made in unseen domains. In practice, there can be substantial uncertainty about the distribution of new data, and corresponding variability in the performance of existing predictors. Building on the theory of partial identification and transportability, this paper introduces new results for bounding the value of a functional of the target distribution, such as the generalization error of a classifiers, given data from source domains and assumptions about the data generating mechanisms, encoded in causal diagrams. Our contribution is to provide the first general estimation technique for transportability problems, adapting existing parameterization schemes such Neural Causal Models to encode the structural constraints necessary for cross-population inference. We demonstrate the expressiveness and consistency of this procedure and further propose a gradient-based optimization scheme for making scalable inferences in practice. Our results are corroborated with experiments and examples.

Particle Semi-Implicit Variational Inference
Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) enriches the expressiveness of variational families by utilizing a kernel and a mixing distribution to hierarchically define the variational distribution. Existing SIVI methods parameterize the mixing distribution using implicit distributions, leading to intractable variational densities. As a result, directly maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) is not possible and so, they resort to either: optimizing bounds on the ELBO, employing costly inner-loop Markov chain Monte Carlo runs, or solving minimax objectives. In this paper, we propose a novel method for SIVI called Particle Variational Inference (PVI) which employs empirical measures to approximate the optimal mixing distributions characterized as the minimizer of a natural free energy functional via a particle approximation of an Euclidean--Wasserstein gradient flow. This approach means that, unlike prior works, PVI can directly optimize the ELBO; furthermore, it makes no parametric assumption about the mixing distribution. Our empirical results demonstrate that PVI performs favourably against other SIVI methods across various tasks. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of the behaviour of the gradient flow of a related free energy functional: establishing the existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as propagation of chaos results.

pcaGAN: Improving Posterior-Sampling cGANs via Principal Component Regularization
In ill-posed imaging inverse problems, there can exist many hypotheses that fit both the observed measurements and prior knowledge of the true image. Rather than returning just one hypothesis of that image, posterior samplers aim to explore the full solution space by generating many probable hypotheses, which can later be used to quantify uncertainty or construct recoveries that appropriately navigate the perception/distortion trade-off. In this work, we propose a fast and accurate posterior-sampling conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that, through a novel form of regularization, aims for correctness in the posterior mean as well as the trace and K principal components of the posterior covariance matrix. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms competitors in a wide range of ill-posed imaging inverse problems.

PCoTTA: Continual Test-Time Adaptation for Multi-Task Point Cloud Understanding
In this paper, we present PCoTTA, an innovative, pioneering framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CoTTA) in multi-task point cloud understanding, enhancing the model's transferability towards the continually changing target domain. We introduce a multi-task setting for PCoTTA, which is practical and realistic, handling multiple tasks within one unified model during the continual adaptation. Our PCoTTA involves three key components: automatic prototype mixture (APM), Gaussian Splatted feature shifting (GSFS), and contrastive prototype repulsion (CPR). Firstly, APM is designed to automatically mix the source prototypes with the learnable prototypes with a similarity balancing factor, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Then, GSFS dynamically shifts the testing sample toward the source domain, mitigating error accumulation in an online manner. In addition, CPR is proposed to pull the nearest learnable prototype close to the testing feature and push it away from other prototypes, making each prototype distinguishable during the adaptation. Experimental comparisons lead to a new benchmark,  demonstrating PCoTTA's superiority in boosting the model's transferability towards the continually changing target domain. We will make our code publicly available.

PCP-MAE: Learning to Predict Centers for Point Masked Autoencoders
Masked autoencoder has been widely explored in point cloud self-supervised learning, whereby the point cloud is generally divided into visible and masked parts. These methods typically include an encoder accepting visible patches (normalized) and corresponding patch centers (position) as input, with the decoder accepting the output of the encoder and the centers (position) of the masked part to reconstruct each point in the masked patches. Then, the pre-trained encoders are used for downstream tasks. In this paper, we show a motivating empirical result that when directly feeding the centers of the masked patches to the decoder without the information of encoders, it still reconstructs well. In other words, the centers of patches are important and the reconstruction objective actually does not necessarily rely on the encoder representations, thus preventing the encoder from learning semantic representations. Based on this key observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, $i.e.$, learning to \textbf{P}redict \textbf{C}enters for \textbf{P}oint \textbf{M}asked \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoders (\textbf{PCP-MAE}) which guide the model to learn to predict the significant centers and use the predicted centers to replace the directly provided centers. Specifically, we propose a Predicting Center Module (PCM) that shares parameters with the original encoder with extra cross-attention to predict centers. Our method is of high pre-training efficiency compared to other alternatives and achieves great improvement over Point-MAE, particularly outperforming it by \textbf{5.50\%, 6.03\%, and 5.17\%} in three variants of ScanObjectNN. The code will be made publicly available.

PEACE: A Dataset of Pharmaceutical Care for Cancer Pain Analgesia Evaluation and Medication Decision
Over half of cancer patients experience long-term pain management challenges. Recently, interest has grown in systems for cancer pain treatment effectiveness assessment (TEA) and medication recommendation (MR) to optimize pharmacological care. These systems aim to improve treatment effectiveness by recommending personalized medication plans based on comprehensive patient information. Despite progress, current systems lack multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) team assessments of treatment and the patient's perception of medication, crucial for effective cancer pain management. Moreover, managing cancer pain medication requires multiple adjustments to the treatment plan based on the patient's evolving condition, a detail often missing in existing datasets. To tackle these issues, we designed the PEACE dataset specifically for cancer pain medication research. It includes detailed pharmacological care records for over 38,000 patients, covering demographics, clinical examination, treatment outcomes, medication plans, and patient self-perceptions. Unlike existing datasets, PEACE records not only long-term and multiple follow-ups both inside and outside hospitals but also includes patients' self-assessments of medication effects and the impact on their lives. We conducted a proof-of-concept study with 11 machine learning algorithms on the PEACE dataset for the TEA (classification task) and MR (regression task). These experiments provide valuable insights into the potential of the PEACE dataset for advancing personalized cancer pain management. The dataset is accessible at: [https://github.com/YTYTYD/PEACE].

Penalty-based Methods for Simple Bilevel Optimization under Hölderian Error Bounds
This paper investigates simple bilevel optimization problems where we minimize a convex upper-level objective over the optimal solution set of a convex lower-level objective. Existing methods for such problems either only guarantee asymptotic convergence, have slow sublinear rates, or require strong assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose a penalization framework that delineates the relationship between approximate solutions of the original problem and its reformulated counterparts. This framework accommodates varying assumptions regarding smoothness and convexity, enabling the application of specific methods with different complexity results. Specifically, when both upper- and lower-level objectives are composite convex functions, under an $\alpha$-Hölderian error bound condition and certain mild assumptions, our algorithm attains an $(\epsilon,\epsilon^{\beta})$-optimal solution of the original problem for any $\beta> 0$ within $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{{1}/{\epsilon^{\max\\{\alpha,\beta\\}}}}\right)$ iterations. The result can be improved further if the smooth part of the upper-level objective is strongly convex. We also establish complexity results when the upper- and lower-level objectives are general nonsmooth functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.

PeRFlow: Piecewise Rectified Flow as Universal Plug-and-Play Accelerator
We present Piecewise Rectified Flow (PeRFlow), a flow-based method for accelerating diffusion models. PeRFlow divides the sampling process of generative flows into several time windows and straightens the trajectories in each interval via the reflow operation, thereby approaching piecewise linear flows. PeRFlow achieves superior performance in a few-step generation. Moreover, through dedicated parameterizations, the PeRFlow models inherit knowledge from the pretrained diffusion models. Thus, the training converges fast and the obtained models show advantageous transfer ability, serving as universal plug-and-play accelerators that are compatible with various workflows based on the pre-trained diffusion models. Codes for training and inference are provided in the supplementary materials.

Permutation-Invariant Autoregressive Diffusion for Graph Generation
Graph generation has been dominated by autoregressive models due to their simplicity and effectiveness, despite their sensitivity to ordering. Yet diffusion models have garnered increasing attention, as they offer comparable performance while being permutation-invariant. Current graph diffusion models generate graphs in a one-shot fashion, but they require extra features and thousands of denoising steps to achieve optimal performance. We introduce PARD, a Permutation-invariant Auto Regressive Diffusion model that integrates diffusion models with autoregressive methods. PARD harnesses the effectiveness and efficiency of the autoregressive model while maintaining permutation invariance without ordering sensitivity. Specifically, we show that contrary to sets, elements in a graph are not entirely un-ordered and there is a unique partial order for nodes and edges. With this partial order, PARD generates a graph in a block-by-block, autoregressive fashion, where each block’s probability is conditionally modeled by a shared diffusion model with an equivariant network. To ensure efficiency while being expressive, we further propose a higher-order graph transformer, which integrates transformer with PPGN (Maronet al., 2019). Like GPT, we extend the higher-order graph transformer to support parallel training of all blocks. Without any extra features, PARD achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular and non-molecular datasets, and scales to large datasets like MOSES containing 1.9M molecules.

Perplexity-aware Correction for Robust Alignment with Noisy Preferences
Alignment techniques are critical in ensuring that large language models (LLMs) output helpful and harmless content by enforcing the LLM-generated content to align with preferences. However, the existence of noisy preferences (NPs), where the responses are mistakenly labelled as chosen or rejected, could deteriorate the alignment, thus making the LLMs generate useless and even malicious content. Existing methods mitigate the issue of NPs from the loss perspective by adjusting the alignment loss based on a clean validation dataset. Orthogonal to these loss-oriented methods, we propose perplexity-aware correction (PerpCorrect) from the data perspective for robust alignment which detects and corrects NPs based on the differences between the perplexity of the chosen and rejected responses (dubbed as PPLDiff). Intuitively, a higher PPLDiff indicates a higher probability of the NP because a rejected/chosen response which is mistakenly labelled as chosen/rejected is less preferable to be generated by an aligned LLM, thus having a higher/lower perplexity. PerpCorrect works in three steps: (1) PerpCorrect aligns a surrogate LLM using the clean validation data to make the PPLDiff able to distinguish clean preferences (CPs) and NPs. (2) PerpCorrect further aligns the surrogate LLM by incorporating the reliably clean training data whose PPLDiff is extremely small and reliably noisy training data whose PPLDiff is extremely large after correction to boost the discriminatory power. (3) Detecting and correcting NPs according to the PPLDiff obtained by the aligned surrogate LLM to obtain a denoised training dataset for robust alignment. Comprehensive experiments validate that our proposed PerpCorrect can achieve state-of-the-art alignment performance under NPs. Notably, PerpCorrect demonstrates practical utility by requiring only a modest number of validation data and being compatible with various alignment techniques. Our code is available at the [Anonymous GitHub](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PerpCorrect-93BB).

Persistence Homology Distillation for Semi-supervised Continual Learning
Semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) has attracted significant attention for addressing catastrophic forgetting in semi-supervised data. Knowledge distillation, which leverages data representation and pair-wise similarity, has shown significant potential in preserving information in SSCL. However, traditional distillation strategies often fail in unlabeled data with inaccurate or noisy information, limiting their efficiency in feature spaces undergoing substantial changes during continual learning. To address these limitations, we propose Persistence Homology Distillation (PsHD) to preserve intrinsic structural information that is insensitive to noise in semi-supervised continual learning. First, we capture the structural features using persistence homology by homological evolution across different scales in vision data, where the multi-scale characteristic established its stability under noise interference. Next, we propose a persistence homology distillation loss in SSCL and also design an efficient acceleration algorithm to reduce the computational cost of persistence homology in our module. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superior stability of PsHD compared to sample representation and pair-wise similarity distillation methods. Finally, experimental results on three widely used datasets validate that the new PsHD outperforms all baselines, with up to 3.2% improvements, and highlights the potential of utilizing unlabeled data in SSCL by reducing 50% memory buffer size.

Persistent Homology for High-dimensional Data Based on Spectral Methods
Persistent homology is a popular computational tool for analyzing the topology of point clouds, such as the presence of loops or voids. However, many real-world datasets with low intrinsic dimensionality reside in an ambient space of much higher dimensionality. We show that in this case traditional persistent homology becomes very sensitive to noise and fails to detect the correct topology. The same holds true for existing refinements of persistent homology. As a remedy, we find that spectral distances on the $k$-nearest-neighbor graph of the data, such as diffusion distance and effective resistance, allow to detect the correct topology even in the presence of high-dimensional noise. Moreover, we derive a novel closed-form formula for effective resistance, and describe its relation to diffusion distances. Finally, we apply these methods to high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing data and show that spectral distances allow robust detection of cell cycle loops.

Persistent Test-time Adaptation in Recurring Testing Scenarios
Current test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches aim to adapt to environments that change continuously. Yet, it is unclear whether TTA methods can maintain their adaptability over prolonged periods. To answer this question, we introduce a diagnostic setting - **recurring TTA** where environments not only change but also recur over time, creating an extensive data stream. This setting allows us to examine the error accumulation of TTA models, in the most basic scenario, when they are regularly exposed to previous testing environments. Furthermore, we simulate a TTA process on a simple yet representative $\epsilon$-**perturbed Gaussian Mixture Model Classifier**, deriving theoretical insights into the dataset- and algorithm-dependent factors contributing to gradual performance degradation. Our investigation leads us to propose **persistent TTA (PeTTA)**, which senses when the model is diverging towards collapse and adjusts the adaptation strategy, striking a balance between the dual objectives of adaptation and model collapse prevention. The supreme stability of PeTTA over existing approaches, in the face of lifelong TTA scenarios, has been demonstrated over comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks.

Personalized Steering of Large Language Models: Versatile Steering Vectors Through Bi-directional Preference Optimization
Researchers have been studying approaches to steer the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) and build personalized LLMs tailored for various applications. While fine-tuning seems to be a direct solution, it requires substantial computational resources and may significantly affect the utility of the original LLM. Recent endeavors have introduced more lightweight strategies, focusing on extracting ``steering vectors'' to guide the model's output toward desired behaviors by adjusting activations within specific layers of the LLM's transformer architecture. However, such steering vectors are directly extracted from the activations of human preference data and thus often lead to suboptimal results and occasional failures, especially in alignment-related scenarios.In this work, we propose an innovative approach that could produce more effective steering vectors through bi-directional preference optimization. Our method is designed to allow steering vectors to directly influence the generation probability of contrastive human preference data pairs, thereby offering a more precise representation of the target behavior. By carefully adjusting the direction and magnitude of the steering vector, we enabled personalized control over the desired behavior across a spectrum of intensities.Extensive experimentation across various open-ended generation tasks, particularly focusing on steering AI personas, has validated the efficacy of our approach. Moreover, we comprehensively investigate critical alignment-concerning scenarios, such as managing truthfulness, mitigating hallucination, and addressing jailbreaking attacks alongside their respective defenses. Remarkably, our method can still demonstrate outstanding steering effectiveness across these scenarios. Furthermore, we showcase the transferability of our steering vectors across different models/LoRAs and highlight the synergistic benefits of applying multiple vectors simultaneously. These findings significantly broaden the practicality and versatility of our proposed method.

Phased Consistency Model
The consistency model (CM) has recently made significant progress in accelerating the generation of diffusion models. However, its application to high-resolution, text-conditioned image generation in the latent space (a.k.a., LCM) remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we identify three key flaws in the current design of LCM. We investigate the reasons behind these limitations and propose the Phased Consistency Model (PCM), which generalizes the design space and addresses all identified limitations. Our evaluations demonstrate that PCM significantly outperforms LCM across 1-16 step generation settings. While PCM is specifically designed for multi-step refinement, it achieves even superior or comparable 1-step generation results to previously state-of-the-art specifically designed 1-step methods. Furthermore, we show that PCM's methodology is versatile and applicable to video generation, enabling us to train the state-of-the-art few-step text-to-video generator.

PhoCoLens: Photorealistic and Consistent Reconstruction in Lensless Imaging
Lensless cameras offer significant advantages in size, weight, and cost compared to traditional lens-based systems. Without a focusing lens, lensless cameras rely on computational algorithms to recover the scenes from multiplexed measurements. However, current algorithms struggle with inaccurate forward imaging models and insufficient priors to reconstruct high-quality images. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage approach for consistent and photorealistic lensless image reconstruction. The first stage of our approach ensures data consistency by focusing on accurately reconstructing the low-frequency content with a spatially varying deconvolution method that adjusts to changes in the Point Spread Function (PSF) across the camera's field of view. The second stage enhances photorealism by incorporating a generative prior from pre-trained diffusion models. By conditioning on the low-frequency content retrieved in the first stage, the diffusion model effectively reconstructs the high-frequency details that are typically lost in the lensless imaging process, while also maintaining image fidelity. Our method achieves a superior balance between data fidelity and visual quality compared to existing methods, as demonstrated with two popular lensless systems, PhlatCam and DiffuserCam. The code and models will be available.

PhyloGen: Language Model-Enhanced Phylogenetic Inference via Graph Structure Generation
Phylogenetic trees elucidate evolutionary relationships among species, but phylogenetic inference remains challenging due to the complexity of combining continuous (branch lengths) and discrete parameters (tree topology).     Traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods face slow convergence and computational burdens. Existing Variational Inference methods, which require pre-generated topologies and typically treat tree structures and branch lengths independently, may overlook critical sequence features, limiting their accuracy and flexibility.    We propose PhyloGen, a novel method leveraging a pre-trained genomic language model to generate and optimize phylogenetic trees without dependence on evolutionary models or aligned sequence constraints. PhyloGen views phylogenetic inference as a conditionally constrained tree structure generation problem, jointly optimizing tree topology and branch lengths through three core modules: (i) Feature Extraction, (ii) PhyloTree Construction, and (iii) PhyloTree Structure Modeling.     Meanwhile, we introduce a Scoring Function to guide the model towards a more stable gradient descent.    We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PhyloGen on eight real-world benchmark datasets. Visualization results confirm PhyloGen provides deeper insights into phylogenetic relationships.

Physics-Constrained Comprehensive Optical Neural Networks
With the advantages of low latency, low power consumption, and high parallelism, optical neural networks (ONN) offer a promising solution for time-sensitive and resource-limited artificial intelligence applications. However, the performance of the ONN model is often diminished by the gap between the ideal simulated system and the actual physical system. To bridge the gap, this work conducts extensive experiments to investigate systematic errors in the optical physical system within the context of image classification tasks. Through our investigation, two quantifiable errors—light source instability and exposure time mismatches—significantly impact the prediction performance of ONN. To address these systematic errors, a physics-constrained ONN learning framework is constructed, including a well designed loss function to mitigate the effect of light fluctuations, a CCD adjustment strategy to alleviate the effects of exposure time mismatches and a ’physics-prior based’ error compensation network to manage other systematic errors, ensuring consistent light intensity across experimental results and simulations. In our experiments, the proposed method achieved a test classification accuracy of 96.5% on the MNIST dataset, a substantial improvement over the 61.6% achieved with the original ONN. For the more challenging QuickDraw16 and Fashion MNIST datasets, experimental accuracy improved from 63.0% to 85.7% and from 56.2% to 77.5%, respectively. Moreover, the comparison results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed physics-constrained ONN learning framework over state-of-the-art ONN approaches. This lays the groundwork for more robust and precise optical computing applications.

Piecewise deterministic generative models
We introduce a novel class of generative models based on piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), a family of non-diffusive stochastic processes consisting of deterministic motion and random jumps at random times. Similarly to diffusions, such Markov processes admit time reversals that turn out to be PDMPs as well. We apply this observation to three PDMPs considered in the literature: the Zig-Zag process, Bouncy Particle Sampler, and Randomised Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. For these three particular instances, we show that the jump rates and kernels of the corresponding time reversals admit explicit expressions depending on some conditional densities of the PDMP under consideration before and after a jump. Based on these results, we propose efficient training procedures to learn these characteristics and consider methods to approximately simulate the reverse process. Finally, we provide bounds in the total variation distance between the data distribution and the resulting distribution of our model in the case where the base distribution is the standard $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Promising numerical simulations support further investigations into this class of models.

PIVOT-R: Primitive-Driven Waypoint-Aware World Model for Robotic Manipulation
Language-guided robotic manipulation is a challenging task that requires an embodied agent to follow abstract user instructions to accomplish various complex manipulation tasks. Previous work generally maps instructions and visual perceptions directly to low-level executable actions, neglecting the modeling of critical waypoints (e.g., key states of “close to/grab/move up” in action trajectories) in manipulation tasks.To address this issue, we propose a PImitive-driVen waypOinT-aware world model for Robotic manipulation (PIVOT-R) that focuses solely on the prediction of task-relevant waypoints. Specifically, PIVOT-R consists of a Waypoint-aware World Model (WAWM) and a lightweight action prediction module. The former performs primitive action parsing and primitive-driven waypoint prediction, while the latter focuses on decoding low-level actions. Additionally, we also design an asynchronous hierarchical executor (AHE) for PIVOT-R, which can use different execution frequencies for different modules of the model, thereby helping the model reduce computational redundancy and improve model execution efficiency. Our PIVOT-R outperforms state-of-the-art (SoTA) open-source models on the SeaWave benchmark, achieving an average relative improvement of 19.45% across four levels of instruction tasks. Moreover, compared to the synchronously executed PIVOT-R, the execution efficiency of PIVOT-R with AHE is increased by 28-fold, with only a 2.9% drop in performance. These results provide compelling evidence that our PIVOT-R can significantly improve both the performance and efficiency of robotic manipulation.

Plant-and-Steal: Truthful Fair Allocations via Predictions
We study truthful mechanisms for approximating the Maximin-Share (MMS) allocation of agents with additive valuations for indivisible goods. Algorithmically, constant factor approximations exist for the problem for any number of agents. When adding incentives to the mix, a jarring result by Amanatidis, Birmpas, Christodoulou, and  Markakis [EC 2017] shows that the best possible approximation for two agents and $m$ items is $\lfloor \frac{m}{2} \rfloor$. We adopt a learning-augmented framework to investigate what is possible when some prediction on the input is given. For two agents, we give a truthful mechanism that takes agents' ordering over items as prediction. When the prediction is accurate, we give a $2$-approximation to the MMS  (consistency), and when the prediction is off, we still get an $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$-approximation to the MMS (robustness). We further show that the mechanism's performance degrades gracefully in the number of ``mistakes" in the prediction; i.e., we interpolate (up to constant factors) between the two extremes: when there are no mistakes, and when there is a maximum number of mistakes. We also show an impossibility result on the obtainable consistency for mechanisms with finite robustness. For the general case of $n\ge 2$ agents, we give a 2-approximation mechanism for accurate predictions, with relaxed fallback guarantees. Finally, we give experimental results which illustrate when different components of  our framework, made to insure consistency and robustness, come into play.

Point Cloud Matters: Rethinking the Impact of Different Observation Spaces on Robot Learning
In robot learning, the observation space is crucial due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities, which can potentially become a bottleneck alongside policy design. In this study, we explore the influence of various observation spaces on robot learning, focusing on three predominant modalities: RGB, RGB-D, and point cloud. We introduce OBSBench, a benchmark comprising two simulators and 125 tasks, along with standardized pipelines for various encoders and policy baselines. Extensive experiments on diverse contact-rich manipulation tasks reveal a notable trend: point cloud-based methods, even those with the simplest designs, frequently outperform their RGB and RGB-D counterparts. This trend persists in both scenarios: training from scratch and utilizing pre-training. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that point cloud observations often yield better policy performance and significantly stronger generalization capabilities across various geometric and visual conditions. These outcomes suggest that the 3D point cloud is a valuable observation modality for intricate robotic tasks. We also suggest that incorporating both appearance and coordinate information can enhance the performance of point cloud methods. We hope our work provides valuable insights and guidance for designing more generalizable and robust robotic models.

Poisson Variational Autoencoder
Variational autoencoders (VAE) employ Bayesian inference to interpret sensory inputs, mirroring processes that occur in primate vision across both ventral (Higgins et al., 2021) and dorsal (Vafaii et al., 2023) pathways. Despite their success, traditional VAEs rely on continuous latent variables, which significantly deviates from the discrete nature of biological neurons. Here, we developed the Poisson VAE (P-VAE), a novel architecture that combines principles of predictive coding with a VAE that encodes inputs into discrete spike counts. Combining Poisson-distributed latent variables with predictive coding introduces a metabolic cost term in the model loss function, suggesting a relationship with sparse coding which we verify empirically. Additionally, we analyze the geometry of learned representations, contrasting the P-VAE to alternative VAE models. We find that the P-VAE encodes its inputs in relatively higher dimensions, facilitating linear separability of categories in a downstream classification task with a much better (5x) sample efficiency. Our work provides an interpretable computational framework to study brain-like sensory processing and paves the way for a deeper understanding of perception as an inferential process.

Policy Optimization for Robust Average Reward MDPs
This paper studies the first-order policy optimization for robust average reward Markov decision processes (MDPs). For robust average reward MDPs, the goal is to optimize the worst-case average reward over the uncertainty set of the transition kernels. We first develop the sub-gradient of the robust average reward. Based on the sub-gradient, the robust policy mirror descent is further proposed. To characterize its iteration complexity, we develop a lower bound on the difference of robust average reward between two policies and further show that the robust average reward satisfies the PL-condition. We then show that with increasing step size, our robust policy mirror descent achieves linear convergence in the optimality gap, and with constant step size, our algorithm converges to an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$. The convergence rate of our algorithm matches with the best convergence rate of the policy-based algorithms for robust MDPs. Moreover, our algorithm is the first algorithm that converges to the global optimum with polynomial time for robust average reward MDPs. We provide simulation results to demonstrate the performance of our algorithm.

Policy-shaped prediction: avoiding distractions in model-based RL
Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is a promising route to sample-efficient policy optimization. However, a known vulnerability of reconstruction-based MBRL consists of scenarios in which detailed aspects of the world are highly predictable, but irrelevant to learning a good policy. Such scenarios can lead the model to exhaust its capacity on meaningless content, at the cost of neglecting important environment dynamics. While existing approaches attempt to solve this problem, we highlight its continuing impact on leading MBRL methods ---including DreamerV3 and DreamerPro--- with a novel environment where background distractions are intricate, predictable, and useless for planning future actions. To address this challenge we develop a method for focusing the capacity of the world model through a synergy of a pretrained segmentation model, a task-aware reconstruction loss, and adversarial learning. Our method outperforms a variety of other approaches designed to reduce the impact of distractors, and is an advance towards robust model-based reinforcement learning.

Polyak Meets Parameter-free Clipped Gradient Descent
Gradient descent and its variants are de facto standard algorithms for training machine learning models. As gradient descent is sensitive to its hyperparameters, we need to tune the hyperparameters carefully using a grid search, but it is time-consuming, especially when multiple hyperparameters exist. Recently, parameter-free methods that adjust the hyperparameters on the fly have been studied. However, the existing work only studied parameter-free methods for the stepsize, and parameter-free methods for other hyperparameters have not been explored. For instance, the gradient clipping threshold is also a crucial hyperparameter in addition to the stepsize to prevent gradient explosion issues, but none of the existing studies investigated the parameter-free methods for clipped gradient descent. In this work, we study the parameter-free methods for clipped gradient descent. Specifically, we propose Inexact Polyak Stepsize, which converges to the optimal solution without any hyperparameters tuning, and its convergence rate is asymptotically independent of $L$ under $L$-smooth and $(L_0, L_1)$-smooth assumptions of the loss function as that of clipped gradient descent with well-tuned hyperparameters. We numerically validated our convergence results using a synthetic function and demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods using LSTM, Nano-GPT, and T5.

Polyhedral Complex Derivation from Piecewise Trilinear Networks
Recent advancements in visualizing deep neural networks provide insights into their structures and mesh extraction from Continuous Piecewise Affine (CPWA) functions. Meanwhile, developments in neural surface representation learning incorporate non-linear positional encoding, addressing issues like spectral bias; however, this poses challenges in applying mesh extraction techniques based on CPWA functions. Focusing on trilinear interpolating methods as positional encoding, we present theoretical insights and an analytical mesh extraction, showing the transformation of hypersurfaces to flat planes within the trilinear region under the eikonal constraint. Moreover, we introduce a method for approximating intersecting points among three hypersurfaces contributing to broader applications. We empirically validate correctness and parsimony through chamfer distance and efficiency, and angular distance, while examining the correlation between the eikonal loss and the planarity of the hypersurfaces.

Polynomial-Time Computation of Exact $\Phi$-Equilibria in Polyhedral Games
It is a well-known fact that correlated equilibria can be computed in polynomial time in a large class of concisely represented games using the celebrated Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm \citep{Papadimitriou2008:Computing, Jiang2015:Polynomial}. However, the landscape of efficiently computable equilibria in sequential (extensive-form) games remains unknown. The Ellipsoid Against Hope does not apply directly to these games, because they do not have the required ``polynomial type'' property. Despite this barrier, \citet{Huang2008:Computing} altered the algorithm to compute exact extensive-form correlated equilibria.In this paper, we generalize the Ellipsoid Against Hope and develop a simple algorithmic framework for efficiently computing saddle-points in bilinear zero-sum games, even when one of the dimensions is exponentially large. Moreover, the framework only requires a ``good-enough-response'' oracle, which is a weakened notion of a best-response oracle.Using this machinery, we develop a general algorithmic framework for computing exact linear $\Phi$-equilibria in any polyhedral game (under mild assumptions), including correlated equilibria in normal-form games, and extensive-form correlated equilibria in extensive-form games. This enables us to give the first polynomial-time algorithm for computing exact linear-deviation correlated equilibria in extensive-form games, thus resolving an open question by \citet{Farina2023:Polynomial}. Furthermore, even for the cases for which a polynomial time algorithm for exact equilibria was already known, our framework provides a conceptually simpler solution.

Poseidon: Efficient Foundation Models for PDEs
We introduce Poseidon, a foundation model for learning the solution operators of PDEs. It is based on a multiscale operator transformer, with time-conditioned layer norms that enable continuous-in-time evaluations. A novel training strategy leveraging the semi-group property of time-dependent PDEs to allow for significant scaling-up of the training data is also proposed. Poseidon is pretrained on a diverse, large scale dataset for the governing equations of fluid dynamics. It is evaluated on a suite of 15 challenging downstream tasks that include a wide variety of PDE types and operators. We show that Poseidon exhibits excellent performance across the board by outperforming baselines significantly, both in terms of sample efficiency and accuracy. Poseidon also generalizes very well to new physics that is not seen during pretraining. Moreover, Poseidon scales with respect to model and data size, both for pretraining and for downstream tasks, demonstrating its potential as an efficient general purpose PDE foundation model.

Position Coupling: Leveraging Task Structure for Improved Length Generalization of Transformers
Even for simple arithmetic tasks like integer addition, it is challenging for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training.To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer.Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more "relevant" tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position.On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to *200-digit* additions (6.67x of the trained length).On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it.We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as Nx2 multiplication and a two-dimensional task.

Post-Hoc Reversal: Are We Selecting Models Prematurely?
Trained models are often composed with post-hoc transforms such as temperaturescaling (TS), ensembling and stochastic weight averaging (SWA) to improveperformance, robustness, uncertainty estimation, etc. However, such transforms aretypically applied only after the base models have already been finalized by standardmeans. In this paper, we challenge this practice with an extensive empirical study.In particular, we demonstrate a phenomenon that we call post-hoc reversal, whereperformance trends are reversed after applying these post-hoc transforms. Thisphenomenon is especially prominent in high-noise settings. For example, whilebase models overfit badly early in training, both conventional ensembling and SWAfavor base models trained for more epochs. Post-hoc reversal can also suppress theappearance of double descent and mitigate mismatches between test loss and testerror seen in base models. Based on our findings, we propose post-hoc selection, asimple technique whereby post-hoc metrics inform model development decisionssuch as early stopping, checkpointing, and broader hyperparameter choices. Ourexperimental analyses span real-world vision, language, tabular and graph datasetsfrom domains like satellite imaging, language modeling, census prediction andsocial network analysis. On an LLM instruction tuning dataset, post-hoc selectionresults in $> 1.5 \times$ MMLU improvement compared to naive selection.

Post-Robustness of Backdoor Purification
Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as they allow attackers to manipulate model predictions with backdoor triggers. To mitigate these security risks, various backdoor purification methods have been proposed to cleanse compromised models. These purified models typically exhibit low Attack Success Rates (ASR), making them resistant to backdoored input. However, Does achieving a low ASR through current purification methods truly eliminate inserted backdoor features? In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this question by thoroughly investigating the \textit{Post-Purification Robustness} of current purification methods. We find that current purification methods are susceptible to quickly relearning the backdoor behavior even with fine-tuning on an extremely small number of poisoned samples. Based on this, we propose the Query-based Reactivation Attack (QRA) which could effectively reactivate the backdoor by only querying purified models. We further found the failure to achieve good post-purification robustness is caused by the inadequate deviation of purified models from the backdoored model along the backdoor-connected path. To improve the post-purification robustness, we propose a simple tuning defense, Path-Aware Minimization (PAM), which promotes deviation along backdoor-connected paths with extra model updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAM significantly improves post-purification robustness while maintaining a good clean accuracy and low attack success rate. Our work provides a new perspective on understanding the effectiveness of backdoor defense and highlights the importance of faithfully assessing post-purification robustness.

PowerGraph: A power grid benchmark dataset for graph neural networks
Power grids are critical infrastructures of paramount importance to modern society and, therefore, engineered to operate under diverse conditions and failures. The ongoing energy transition poses new challenges for the decision-makers and system operators. Therefore, we must develop grid analysis algorithms to ensure reliable operations. These key tools include power flow analysis and system security analysis, both needed for effective operational and strategic planning. The literature review shows a growing trend of machine learning (ML) models that perform these analyses effectively. In particular, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) stand out in such applications because of the graph-based structure of power grids. However, there is a lack of publicly available graph datasets for training and benchmarking ML models in electrical power grid applications. First, we present PowerGraph, which comprises GNN-tailored datasets for i) power flows, ii) optimal power flows, and iii) cascading failure analyses of power grids. Second, we provide ground-truth explanations for the cascading failure analysis. Finally, we perform a complete benchmarking of GNN methods for node-level and graph-level tasks and explainability. Overall, PowerGraph is a multifaceted GNN dataset for diverse tasks that includes power flow and fault scenarios with real-world explanations, providing a valuable resource for developing improved GNN models for node-level, graph-level tasks and explainability methods in power system modeling. The dataset is available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PowerGraph/22820534 and the code at https://github.com/PowerGraph-Datasets.

Practical $0.385$-Approximation for Submodular Maximization Subject to a Cardinality Constraint
Non-monotone constrained submodular maximization plays a crucial role in various machine learning applications. However, existing algorithms often struggle with a trade-off between approximation guarantees and practical efficiency. The current state-of-the-art is a recent $0.401$-approximation algorithm, but its computational complexity makes it highly impractical. The best practical algorithms for the problem only guarantee $1/e$-approximation. In this work, we present a novel algorithm for submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint that combines a guarantee of $0.385$-approximation with a low and practical query complexity of $O(n+k^2)$. Furthermore, we evaluate our algorithm's performance through extensive machine learning applications, including Movie Recommendation, Image Summarization, and more. These evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

Practical Bayesian Algorithm Execution via Posterior Sampling
We consider the \textit{Bayesian algorithm execution} framework, where the goal is to select points for evaluating an expensive function to best infer a property of interest. By making the key observation that the property of interest for many tasks is a target set of points defined in terms of the function, we derive a simple yet effective and scalable posterior sampling algorithm, termed PS-BAX.Our framework addresses a broad range of problems, including many optimization variants and level-set estimation. Experiments across a diverse set of tasks show that PS-BAX achieves competitive performance against standard baselines, while being significantly faster, simpler to implement, and easily parallelizable. In addition, we show that PS-BAX is asymptotically consistent under mild regularity conditions. Consequently, our work broadens the application scope of posterior sampling and provides a simple, strong baseline for future exploration in this area.

Precipitation Downscaling with Spatiotemporal Video Diffusion
In climate science and meteorology, high-resolution local precipitation (rain and snowfall) predictions are limited by the computational costs of simulation-based methods. Statistical downscaling, or super-resolution, is a common workaround where a low-resolution prediction is improved using statistical approaches. Unlike traditional computer vision tasks, weather and climate applications require capturing the accurate conditional distribution of high-resolution given low-resolution patterns to assure reliable ensemble averages and unbiased estimates of extreme events, such as heavy rain. This work extends recent video diffusion models to precipitation super-resolution, employing a deterministic downscaler followed by a temporally-conditioned diffusion model to capture noise characteristics and high-frequency patterns. We test our approach on FV3GFS output, an established large-scale global atmosphere model, and compare it against six state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis, capturing CRPS, MSE, precipitation distributions, and qualitative aspects using California and the Himalayas as examples, establishes our method as a new standard for data-driven precipitation downscaling.

Precise asymptotics of reweighted least-squares algorithms for linear diagonal networks
The classical iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) algorithm aims to recover an unknown signal from linear measurements by performing a sequence of weighted least squares problems, where the weights are recursively updated at each step. Varieties of this algorithm have been shown to achieve favorable empirical performance and theoretical guarantees for sparse recovery and $\ell_p$-norm minimization. Recently, some preliminary connections have also been made between IRLS and certain types of non-convex linear neural network architectures that are observed to exploit low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional linear models. In this work, we provide a unified asymptotic analysis for a family of algorithms that encompasses IRLS, the recently proposed lin-RFM algorithm (which was motivated by feature learning in neural networks), and the alternating minimization algorithm on linear diagonal neural networks. Our analysis operates in a "batched" setting with i.i.d. Gaussian covariates and shows that, with appropriately chosen reweighting policy, the algorithm can achieve favorable performance in only a handful of iterations. We also extend our results to the case of group-sparse recovery and show that leveraging this structure in the reweighting scheme provably improves test error compared to coordinate-wise reweighting.

Precise Relational DNN Verification With Cross Executional Branching
We propose RABBit, a Branch-and-Bound-based verifier for verifying relational properties defined over Deep Neural Networks, such as robustness against universal adversarial perturbations (UAP). Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) complete $L_{\infty}$-robustness verifiers can not reason about dependencies between multiple executions and, as a result, are imprecise for relational verification. In contrast, existing SOTA relational verifiers only apply a single bounding step and do not utilize any branching strategies to refine the obtained bounds, thus producing imprecise results. We develop the first scalable Branch-and-Bound-based relational verifier, RABBit, which efficiently combines branching over multiple executions with cross-executional bound refinement to utilize relational constraints, gaining substantial precision over SOTA baselines on a wide range of datasets and networks.

Predicting the Performance of Foundation Models via Agreement-on-the-Line
Estimating the out-of-distribution performance in regimes where labels are scarce is critical to safely deploy foundation models. Recently, it was shown that ensembles of neural networks observe the phenomena "agreement-on-the-line", which can be leveraged to reliably predict OOD performance without labels. However, in contrast to classical neural networks that are trained on in-distribution data from scratch for numerous epochs, foundation models undergo minimal finetuning from heavily pretrained weights, which may reduce the ensemble diversity needed to observe agreement-on-the-line. In our work, we demonstrate that when lightly finetuning multiple runs from a $\textit{single}$ foundation model, the choice of randomness during training (linear head initialization, data ordering, and data subsetting) can lead to drastically different levels of agreement-on-the-line in the resulting ensemble. Surprisingly, only random head initialization is able to reliably induce agreement-on-the-line in finetuned foundation models across vision and language benchmarks. Second, we demonstrate that ensembles of $\textit{multiple}$ foundation models pretrained on different datasets but finetuned on the same task can also show agreement-on-the-line. In total, by careful construction of a diverse ensemble, we can utilize agreement-on-the-line-based methods to predict the OOD performance of foundation models with high precision.

Prediction with Action: Visual Policy Learning via Joint Denoising Process
Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image generation tasks, including image editing and video creation, representing a good understanding of the physical world. On the other line, diffusion models have also shown promise in robotic control tasks by denoising actions, known as diffusion policy. Although the diffusion generative model and diffusion policy exhibit distinct capabilities—image prediction and robotic action, respectively—they technically follow similar denoising process. In robotic tasks, the ability to predict future images and generate actions is highly correlated since they share the same underlying dynamics of the physical world. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{PAD}, a novel visual policy learning framework that unifies image \textbf{P}rediction and robot \textbf{A}ction within a joint \textbf{D}enoising process.  Specifically, PAD utilizes Diffusion Transformers (DiT) to seamlessly integrate images and robot states, enabling the simultaneous prediction of future images and robot actions. Additionally, PAD supports co-training on both robotic demonstrations and large-scale video datasets and can be easily extended to other robotic modalities, such as depth images. PAD outperforms previous methods, achieving a significant 38.9\% relative improvement on the full Metaworld benchmark, by utilizing a single text-conditioned visual policy within a data-efficient imitation learning setting. Furthermore, PAD demonstrates superior generalization to unseen tasks in real-world robot manipulation settings with 28.0\% success rate increase compared to the strongest baseline. Videos of PAD can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/pad-paper

Predictive Attractor Models
Sequential memory, the ability to form and accurately recall a sequence of events or stimuli in the correct order, is a fundamental prerequisite for biological and artificial intelligence as it underpins numerous cognitive functions (e.g., language comprehension, planning, episodic memory formation, etc.) However, existing methods of sequential memory suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limited capacity, slow iterative learning procedures, low-order Markov memory, and, most importantly, the inability to represent and generate multiple valid future possibilities stemming from the same context. Inspired by biologically plausible neuroscience theories of cognition, we propose Predictive Attractor Models (PAM), a novel sequence memory architecture with desirable generative properties. PAM is a streaming model that learns a sequence in an online, continuous manner by observing each input only once. Additionally, we find that PAM avoids catastrophic forgetting by uniquely representing past context through lateral inhibition in cortical minicolumns, which prevents new memories from overwriting previously learned knowledge. PAM generates future predictions by sampling from a union set of predicted possibilities; this generative ability is realized through an attractor model trained alongside the predictor. We show that PAM is trained with local computations through Hebbian plasticity rules in a biologically plausible framework. Other desirable traits (e.g., noise tolerance, CPU-based learning, capacity scaling) are discussed throughout the paper. Our findings suggest that PAM represents a significant step forward in the pursuit of biologically plausible and computationally efficient sequential memory models, with broad implications for cognitive science and artificial intelligence research.

Predictor-Corrector Enhanced Transformers with Exponential Moving Average Coefficient Learning
Residual networks, as discrete approximations of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), have inspired significant advancements in neural network design, including multistep methods, high-order methods, and multi-particle dynamical systems. The precision of the solution to ODEs significantly affects parameter optimization, thereby impacting model performance. In this work, we present a series of advanced explorations of Transformer architecture design to minimize the error compared to the true ``solution.'' First, we introduce a predictor-corrector learning framework to minimize truncation errors, which consist of a high-order predictor and a multistep corrector. Second, we propose an exponential moving average-based coefficient learning method to further strengthen our higher-order predictor. Extensive experiments on large-scale machine translation, abstractive summarization, language modeling, and natural language understanding benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. On the WMT'14 English-German and English-French tasks, our model achieved BLEU scores of 30.95 and 44.27, respectively. Additionally, on the OPUS multilingual machine translation task, our model surpasses a robust 3.8B DeepNet by an average of 2.9 SacreBLEU, using only one-third of the parameters.

Pre-Trained Multi-Goal Transformers with Prompt Optimization for Efficient Online Adaptation
Efficiently solving unseen tasks remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), especially for long-horizon tasks composed of multiple subtasks. Pre-training policies from task-agnostic datasets has emerged as a promising approach, yet existing methods still necessitate substantial interactions via RL to learn new tasks.We introduce MGPO, a method that leverages the power of Transformer-based policies to model sequences of goals, enabling efficient online adaptation through prompt optimization.In its pre-training phase, MGPO utilizes hindsight multi-goal relabeling and behavior cloning. This combination equips the policy to model diverse long-horizon behaviors that align with varying goal sequences.During online adaptation, the goal sequence, conceptualized as a prompt, is optimized to improve task performance. We adopt a multi-armed bandit framework for this process, enhancing prompt selection based on the returns from online trajectories.Our experiments across various environments demonstrate that MGPO holds substantial advantages in sample efficiency, online adaptation performance, robustness, and interpretability compared with existing methods.

Pre-trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Are Versatile Representation Learners for Control
Embodied AI agents require a fine-grained understanding of the physical world mediated through visual and language inputs. Such capabilities are difficult to learn solely from task-specific data. This has led to the emergence of pre-trained vision-language models as a tool for transferring representations learned from internet-scale data to downstream tasks and new domains. However, commonly used contrastively trained representations such as in CLIP have been shown to fail at enabling embodied agents to gain a sufficiently fine-grained scene understanding---a capability vital for control. To address this shortcoming, we consider representations from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, which are explicitly optimized to generate images from text prompts and as such, contain text-conditioned representations that reflect highly fine-grained visuo-spatial information. Using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, we construct Stable Control Representations which allow learning downstream control policies that generalize to complex, open-ended environments. We show that policies learned using Stable Control Representations are competitive with state-of-the-art representation learning approaches across a broad range of simulated control settings, encompassing challenging manipulation and navigation tasks. Most notably, we show that Stable Control Representations enable learning policies that exhibit state-of-the-art performance on OVMM, a difficult open-vocabulary navigation benchmark.

Pretraining with Random Noise for Fast and Robust Learning without Weight Transport
Unlike artificial neural networks, the brain prepares for learning even before interacting with the environment, by refining and optimizing its structures through prenatal, spontaneous neural activity that remotely resembles random noise. However, the mechanism of such a pretraining process has yet to be thoroughly understood, and it is unclear whether this process can benefit the training of machine learning algorithms. Here, we study this issue using a neural network with a feedback alignment algorithm, demonstrating that pretraining neural networks with random noise can greatly increase the learning efficiency as well as generalization abilities without weight transport. First, we found that random noise training modifies forward weights to match backward synaptic feedback, which is necessary for feedback alignment, a biologically plausible error backpropagation algorithm. As a result, a network with pre-aligned weights learns notably faster than a network without random noise training, even reaching a convergence speed comparable to that of a backpropagation algorithm. We confirm that sequential training with both random noise and data brings weights closer to synaptic feedback than training solely with data, enabling more precise credit assignment and faster learning. We also found that each readout probability approaches the chance level and that the effective dimensionality of weights decreases in a network pretrained with random noise. This pre-regularization through random noise training allows the network to learn simple solutions of a low rank, reducing the generalization loss during subsequent training. We also observed that this enables the network robustly to generalize a novel “out-of-distribution” dataset. Lastly, by examining the task-agnostic property of random training, we confirmed that random noise pretraining reduces the amount of meta-loss, enhancing the network’s ability to adapt to various tasks. Overall, our results suggest that random noise training with feedback alignment, modeled after the early brain's strategy, offers a straightforward yet effective method of network pretraining that facilitates quick and reliable learning without weight transport.

Preventing Dimensional Collapse in Self-Supervised Learning via Orthogonality Regularization
Self-supervised learning (SSL) has rapidly advanced in recent years, approaching the performance of its supervised counterparts through the extraction of representations from unlabeled data. However, dimensional collapse, where a few large eigenvalues dominate the eigenspace, poses a significant obstacle for SSL. When dimensional collapse occurs on features (e.g. hidden features and representations), it prevents features from representing the full information of the data; when dimensional collapse occurs on weight matrices, their filters are self-related and redundant, limiting their expressive power.Existing studies have predominantly concentrated on the dimensional collapse of representations, neglecting whether this can sufficiently prevent the dimensional collapse of the weight matrices and hidden features. To this end, we first time propose a mitigation approach employing orthogonal regularization (OR) across the encoder, targeting both convolutional and linear layers during pretraining. OR promotes orthogonality within weight matrices, thus safeguarding against the dimensional collapse of weight matrices, hidden features, and representations. Our empirical investigations demonstrate that OR significantly enhances the performance of SSL methods across diverse benchmarks, yielding consistent gains with both CNNs and Transformer-based architectures.

Preventing Model Collapse in Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis by Noise Regularization
Multi-View Representation Learning (MVRL) aims to learn a unified representation of an object from multi-view data.Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) and its variants share simple formulations and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. However, with extensive experiments, we observe the issue of model collapse, i.e., the performance of DCCA-based methods will drop drastically when training proceeds. The model collapse issue could significantly hinder the wide adoption of DCCA-based methods because it is challenging to decide when to early stop. To this end, we develop NR-DCCA, which is equipped with a novel noise regularization approach to prevent model collapse. Theoretical analysis shows that the Correlation Invariant Property is the key to preventing model collapse, and our noise regularization forces the neural network to possess such a property. A framework to construct synthetic data with different common and complementary information is also developed to compare MVRL methods comprehensively. The developed NR-DCCA outperforms baselines stably and consistently in both synthetic and real-world datasets, and the proposed noise regularization approach can also be generalized to other DCCA-based methods such as DGCCA.

Pricing and Competition for Generative AI
Compared to classical machine learning (ML) models, generative models offer a new usage paradigm where (i) a single model can be used for many different tasks out-of-the-box; (ii) users interact with this model over a series of natural language prompts; and (iii) the model is ideally evaluated on binary user satisfaction with respect to model outputs. Given these characteristics, we explore the problem of how developers of new generative AI software can release and price their technology. We first develop a comparison of two different models for a specific task with respect to user cost-effectiveness. We then model the pricing problem of generative AI software as a game between two different companies who sequentially release their models before users choose their preferred model for each task. Here, the price optimization problem becomes piecewise continuous where the companies must choose a subset of the tasks on which to be cost-effective and forgo revenue for the remaining tasks. In particular, we reveal the value of market information by showing that a company who deploys later after knowing their competitor's price can always secure cost-effectiveness on at least one task, whereas the company who is the first-to-market must price their model in a way that incentivizes higher prices from the latecomer in order to gain revenue. Most importantly, we find that if the different tasks are sufficiently similar, the first-to-market model may become cost-ineffective on all tasks regardless of how this technology is priced.

Principled Bayesian Optimization in Collaboration with Human Experts
Bayesian optimisation for real-world problems is often performed interactively with human experts, and integrating their domain knowledge is key to accelerate the optimisation process. We consider a setup where experts provide advice on the next query point through binary accept/reject recommendations (labels). Experts' labels are often costly, requiring efficient use of their efforts, and can at the same time be unreliable, requiring careful adjustment of the degree to which any expert is trusted. We introduce the first principled approach that provides two key guarantees. (1) Handover guarantee: similar to a no-regret property, we establish a sublinear bound on the cumulative number of experts' binary labels. Initially, multiple labels per query are needed, but the number of expert labels required asymptotically converges to zero, saving both expert effort and computation time. (2) No-harm guarantee with data-driven trust level adjustment: our adaptive trust level ensures that the convergence rate will not be worse than the one without using advice, even if the advice from experts is adversarial. Unlike existing methods that employ a user-defined function that hand-tunes the trust level adjustment, our approach enables data-driven adjustments. Real-world applications empirically demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing baselines, but also maintains robustness despite varying labelling accuracy, in tasks of battery design with human experts.

Principled Probabilistic Imaging using Diffusion Models as Plug-and-Play Priors
Diffusion models (DMs) have recently shown outstanding capability in modeling complex image distributions, making them expressive image priors for solving Bayesian inverse problems. However, most existing DM-based methods rely on approximations in the generative process to be generic to different inverse problems, leading to inaccurate sample distributions that deviate from the target posterior defined within the Bayesian framework. To harness the generative power of DMs while avoiding such approximations, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that performs posterior sampling for general inverse problems by reducing it to sampling the posterior of a Gaussian denoising problem. Crucially, we leverage a general DM formulation as a unified interface that allows for rigorously solving the denoising problem with a range of state-of-the-art DMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on six inverse problems (three linear and three nonlinear), including a real-world black hole imaging problem. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method offers more accurate reconstructions and posterior estimation compared to existing DM-based imaging inverse methods.

Privacy without Noisy Gradients: Slicing Mechanism for Generative Model Training
Training generative models with differential privacy (DP)  typically involves injecting noise into gradient updates or adapting the discriminator's training procedure. As a result, such approaches often struggle with hyper-parameter tuning and convergence. We consider the \emph{slicing privacy mechanism} that injects noise into random low-dimensional projections of the private data, and provide strong privacy guarantees for it. These noisy projections are used for training generative models.To enable optimizing generative models using this DP approach, we introduce the \emph{smoothed-sliced $f$-divergence} and show it enjoys statistical consistency.  Moreover, we present a kernel-based estimator for this divergence, circumventing the need for adversarial training. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate synthetic data of higher quality compared with baselines. Beyond performance improvement, our method, by sidestepping the need for noisy gradients, offers data scientists the flexibility to adjust generator architecture and hyper-parameters, run the optimization over any number of epochs, and even restart the optimization process---all without incurring additional privacy costs.

Private Edge Density Estimation for Random Graphs: Optimal, Efficient and Robust
We give the first polynomial-time, differentially node-private, and robust algorithm for estimating the edge density of Erdős-Rényi random graphs and their generalization, inhomogeneous random graphs. We further prove information-theoretical lower bounds, showing that the error rate of our algorithm is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Previous algorithms incur either exponential running time or suboptimal error rates.Two key ingredients of our algorithm are (1) a new sum-of-squares algorithm for robust edge density estimation, and (2) the reduction from privacy to robustness based on sum-of-squares exponential mechanisms due to Hopkins et al. (STOC 2023).

Private Geometric Median
In this paper, we study differentially private (DP) algorithms for computing the geometric median (GM) of a dataset: Given $n$ points, $x_1,\dots,x_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the goal is to find a point $\theta$ that minimizes the sum of the Euclidean distances to these points, i.e., $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lVert|\theta - x_i\rVert_2$. Off-the-shelf methods, such as DP-GD, require strong a priori knowledge locating the data within a ball of radius $R$, and the excess risk of the algorithm depends linearly on $R$. In this paper, we ask: can we design an efficient and private algorithm with an excess error guarantee that scales with the (unknown) radius containing the majority of the datapoints? Our main contribution is a pair of polynomial-time DP algorithms for the task of private GM with an excess error guarantee that scales with the effective diameter of the datapoints. Additionally, we propose an inefficient algorithm based on the inverse smooth sensitivity mechanism, which satisfies the more restrictive notion of pure DP. We complement our results with a lower bound and demonstrate the optimality of our polynomial-time algorithms in terms of sample complexity.

PrivCirNet: Efficient Private Inference via Block Circulant Transformation
Homomorphic encryption (HE)-based deep neural network (DNN) inference protects data and model privacy but suffers from significant computation overhead. We observe transforming the DNN weights into circulant matrices converts general matrix-vector multiplications into HE-friendly 1-dimensional convolutions, drastically reducing the HE computation cost. Hence, in this paper, we propose PrivCirNet, a protocol/network co-optimization framework based on block circulant transformation. At the protocol level, PrivCirNet customizes the HE encoding algorithm that is fully compatible with the block circulant transformation and reduces the computation latency in proportion to the block size. At the network level, we propose a latency-aware formulation to search for the layer-wise block size assignment based on second-order information. PrivCirNet also leverages layer fusion to further reduce the inference cost. We compare PrivCirNet with the state-of-the-art HE-based framework Bolt (IEEE S\&P 2024) and HE-friendly pruning method SpENCNN (ICML 2023). For ResNet-18 and Vision Transformer (ViT) on Tiny ImageNet, PrivCirNet reduces latency by $5.0\times$ and $1.3\times$ with iso-accuracy over Bolt, respectively, and improves accuracy by $4.1$\% and $12$\% over SpENCNN, respectively. For MobileNetV2 on ImageNet, PrivCirNet achieves $1.7\times$ lower latency and $4.2$\% better accuracy over Bolt and SpENCNN, respectively. Our code and checkpoints are available in the supplementary materials.

Probabilistic Conformal Distillation for Enhancing Missing Modality Robustness
Multimodal models trained on modality-complete data are plagued with severe performance degradation when encountering modality-missing data. Prevalent cross-modal knowledge distillation-based methods precisely align the representation of modality-missing data and that of its modality-complete counterpart to enhance robustness. However, due to the irreparable information asymmetry, this determinate alignment is too stringent, easily inducing modality-missing features to capture spurious factors erroneously. In this paper, a novel multimodal Probabilistic Conformal Distillation (PCD) method is proposed, which considers the inherent indeterminacy in this alignment. Given a modality-missing input, our goal is to learn the unknown Probability Density Function (PDF) of the mapped variables in the modality-complete space, rather than relying on the brute-force point alignment. Specifically, PCD models the modality-missing feature as a probabilistic distribution, enabling it to satisfy two characteristics of the PDF. One is the extremes of probabilities of modality-complete feature points on the PDF, and the other is the geometric consistency between the modeled distributions and the peak points of different PDFs. Extensive experiments on a range of benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCD over state-of-the-art methods.

Probabilistic Decomposed Linear Dynamical Systems for Robust Discovery of Latent Neural Dynamics
Time-varying linear state-space models are powerful tools for obtaining mathematically interpretable representations of neural signals. For example, switching and decomposed models describe complex systems using latent variables that evolve according to simple locally linear dynamics. However, existing methods for latent variable estimation are not robust to dynamical noise and system nonlinearity due to noise-sensitive inference procedures and limited model formulations. This can lead to inconsistent results on signals with similar dynamics, limiting the model's ability to provide scientific insight. In this work, we address these limitations and propose a probabilistic approach to latent variable estimation in decomposed models that improves robustness against dynamical noise. Additionally, we introduce an extended latent dynamics model to improve robustness against system nonlinearities. We evaluate our approach on several synthetic dynamical systems, including an empirically-derived brain-computer interface experiment, and demonstrate more accurate latent variable inference in nonlinear systems with diverse noise conditions. Furthermore, we apply our method to a real-world clinical neurophysiology dataset, illustrating the ability to identify interpretable and coherent structure where previous models cannot.

Probabilistic Graph Rewiring via Virtual Nodes
Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph-based machine learning. Despite their effectiveness, MPNNs face challenges such as under-reaching and over-squashing, where limited receptive fields and structural bottlenecks hinder information flow in the graph. While graph transformers hold promise in addressing these issues, their scalability is limited due to quadratic complexity regarding the number of nodes, rendering them impractical for larger graphs. Here, we propose implicitly rewired message-passing neural networks (IPR-MPNNs), a novel approach that integrates implicit probabilistic graph rewiring into MPNNs. By introducing a small number of virtual nodes, i.e., adding additional nodes to a given graph and connecting them to existing nodes, in a differentiable, end-to-end manner, IPR-MPNNs enable long-distance message propagation, circumventing quadratic complexity. Theoretically, we demonstrate that IPR-MPNNs surpass the expressiveness of traditional MPNNs.  Empirically, we validate our approach by showcasing its ability to mitigate under-reaching and over-squashing effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple graph datasets. Notably, IPR-MPNNs outperform graph transformers while maintaining significantly faster computational efficiency.

Probabilistic size-and-shape functional mixed models
The reliable recovery and uncertainty quantification of a fixed effect function $\mu$ in a functional mixed model, for modeling population- and object-level variability in noisily observed functional data, is a notoriously challenging task: variations along the $x$ and $y$ axes are confounded with additive measurement error, and cannot in general be disentangled. The question then as to what properties of $\mu$ may be reliably recovered becomes important. We demonstrate that it is possible to recover the size-and-shape of a square-integrable $\mu$ under a Bayesian functional mixed model. The size-and-shape of $\mu$ is a geometric property invariant to a family of space-time unitary transformations, viewed as rotations of the Hilbert space, that jointly transform the $x$ and $y$ axes. A random object-level unitary transformation then captures size-and-shape preserving deviations of $\mu$ from an individual function, while a random linear term and measurement error capture size-and-shape altering deviations. The model is regularized by appropriate priors on the unitary transformations, posterior summaries of which may then be suitably interpreted as optimal data-driven rotations of a fixed orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space. Our numerical experiments demonstrate utility of the proposed model, and superiority over the current state-of-the-art.

ProgressEditor: Simple Progression is All You Need for High-Quality 3D Scene Editing
This paper proposes ProgressEditor that performs high-quality diffusion distillation-guided 3D scene editing in a novel progressive manner with a simple yet effective framework. Inspired by the crucial observation that the multi-view inconsistency issue in the scene editing task is rooted in the diffusion model's large feasible output space (FOS), we introduce a novel framework to control the size of FOS and reduce inconsistency by decomposing the full editing tasks into several subtasks, and progressively perform each of them on the scene. Within this framework, we design a difficulty-aware subtask decomposition scheduler and an adaptive 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) training strategy, to perform each decomposed subtasks in high efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our ProgressEditor produces state-of-the-art scene editing results in various scenes and challenging editing tasks, through a simple framework without any expensive or sophisticated add-ons like distillation losses, components, or training procedures. Notably, ProgressEditor also provides a new way to preview, control, and select the aggressivity of editing operation during the editing process.

Progressive Cross-Scale Self-Supervised Blind Image Deconvolution via Implicit Neural Representation
Blind image deconvolution (BID) is an important yet challenging image recovery problem. Most existing deep learning-based BID methods require supervised training with ground truth (GT) images. This paper introduces a self-supervised method for BID that does not require GT images. The key challenge is to regularize the training to prevent over-fitting due to the absence of GT images. By leveraging an exact relationship among the blurred image, latent image, and blur kernel across consecutive scales, we propose an effective cross-scale consistency loss. This is implemented by representing the image and kernel with implicit neural representations (INRs), whose resolution-free property enables  consistent yet efficient computation for network training at multiple scales. Combined with a progressively coarse-to-fine training scheme, the proposed method significantly outperforms existing self-supervised methods on several datasets in extensive experiments.

Progressive Entropic Optimal Transport Solvers
Optimal transport (OT) has profoundly impacted machine learning by providing theoretical and computational tools to realign datasets.In this context, given two large point clouds of sizes $n$ and $m$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, entropic OT (EOT) solvers have emerged as the most reliable tool to either solve the Kantorovich problem and output a $n\times m$ coupling matrix, or to solve the Monge problem and learn a vector-valued push-forward map. While the robustness of EOT couplings/maps makes them a go-to choice in practical applications, EOT solvers remain difficult to tune because of a small but influential set of hyperparameters, notably the omnipresent entropic regularization strength $\varepsilon$. Setting $\varepsilon$ can be difficult, as it simultaneously impacts various performance metrics, such as compute speed, statistical performance, generalization, and bias. In this work, we propose a new class of EOT solvers (ProgOT), that can estimate both plans and transport maps.We take advantage of several opportunities to optimize the computation of EOT solutions by *dividing* mass displacement using a time discretization, borrowing inspiration from dynamic OT formulations, and *conquering* each of these steps using EOT with properly scheduled parameters. We provide experimental evidence demonstrating that ProgOT is a faster and more robust alternative to *standard solvers* when computing couplings at large scales, even outperforming neural network-based approaches. We also prove statistical consistency of our approach for estimating optimal transport maps.

Promoting Fairness Among Dynamic Agents in Online-Matching Markets under Known Stationary Arrival Distributions
Online (bipartite) matching under known stationary arrivals is a fundamental model that has been  studied extensively under the objective of maximizing the total number of customers served. We instead study the objective of *maximizing the minimum matching rate across all online types*, which is referred to as long-run (individual) fairness. For Online Matching under long-run Fairness (OM-LF) with a single offline agent, we show  that the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) policy is $1$-competitive, i.e., matching any optimal clairvoyant. For the general case of OM-LF: We present a sampling algorithm (SAMP) and show that (1) SAMP is of competitiveness of at least $1-1/e$ and (2) it is asymptotically optimal with competitiveness approaches one in different regimes when either all offline agents have a sufficiently large matching capacity, or all online types have a sufficiently large arrival rate, or highly imbalance between the total offline matching capacity and the number of online arrivals. To complement the competitive results, we show the following hardness results for OM-LF: (1) Any non-rejecting policy (matching every arriving online agent if possible) is no more than $1/2$-competitive; (2) Any (randomized) policy is no more than $(\sqrt{3}-1)$-competitive; (3) SAMP can be no more than $(1-1/e)$-competitive suggesting the tightness of competitive analysis for SAMP. We stress that all hardness results mentioned here are independent of any benchmarks.  We also consider a few extensions of OM-LF by proposing a few variants of fairness metrics, including long-run group-level fairness and short-run fairness, and we devise related algorithms with provable competitive performance.

Prompt-Agnostic Adversarial Perturbation for Customized Diffusion Models
Diffusion models have revolutionized customized text-to-image generation, allowing for efficient synthesis of photos from personal data with textual descriptions. However, these advancements bring forth risks including privacy breaches and unauthorized replication of artworks. Previous researches primarily center around using “prompt-specific methods” to generate adversarial examples to protect personal images, yet the effectiveness of existing methods is hindered by constrained adaptability to different prompts.In this paper, we introduce a Prompt-Agnostic Adversarial Perturbation (PAP) method for customized diffusion models. PAP first models the prompt distribution using a Laplace Approximation, and then produces prompt-agnostic perturbations by maximizing a disturbance expectation based on the modeled distribution.This approach effectively tackles the prompt-agnostic attacks, leading to improved defense stability.Extensive experiments in face privacy and artistic style protection, demonstrate the superior generalization of our method in comparison to existing techniques.

Prompt Tuning Strikes Back: Customizing Foundation Models with Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the standard for customising Foundation Models (FMs) to user-specific downstream tasks. However, typical PEFT methods require storing multiple task-specific adapters, creating scalability issues as these adapters must be housed and run at the FM server. Traditional prompt tuning offers a potential solution by customising them through task-specific input prefixes, but it under-performs compared to other PEFT methods like LoRA. To address this gap, we propose Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation (LOPA), a prompt-tuning-based approach that performs on par with state-of-the-art PEFT methods and full fine-tuning while being more parameter-efficient and not requiring a server-based adapter. LOPA generates soft prompts by balancing between sharing task-specific information across instances and customization for each instance. It uses a low-rank decomposition of the soft-prompt component encoded for each instance to achieve parameter efficiency. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on multiple natural language understanding and code generation and understanding tasks across a wide range of foundation models with varying sizes.

Proportional Fairness in Clustering: A Social Choice Perspective
We study the proportional clustering problem of Chen et al. (ICML'19) and relate it to the area of multiwinner voting in computational social choice. We show that any clustering satisfying a weak proportionality notion of Brill and Peters (EC'23) simultaneously obtains the best known approximations to the proportional fairness notion of Chen et al., but also to individual fairness (Jung et al., FORC'20) and the ``core'' (Li et al., ICML'21). In fact, we show that any approximation to proportional fairness is also an approximation to individual fairness and vice versa. Finally, we also study stronger notions of proportional representation, in which deviations do not only happen to single, but multiple candidate centers, and show that stronger proportionality notions of Brill and Peters imply approximations to these stronger guarantees.

Proportional Fairness in Non-Centroid Clustering
We revisit the recently developed framework of proportionally fair clustering, where the goal is to provide group fairness guarantees that become stronger for groups of data points that are large and cohesive. Prior work applies this framework to centroid-based clustering, where points are partitioned into clusters, and the cost to each data point is measured by its distance to a centroid assigned to its cluster. However, real-life applications often do not require such centroids. We extend the theory of proportionally fair clustering to non-centroid clustering by considering a variety of cost functions, both metric and non-metric, for a data point to be placed in a cluster with other data points. Our results indicate that Greedy Capture, a clustering algorithm developed for centroid clustering, continues to provide strong proportional fairness guarantees for non-centroid clustering, although the guarantees are significantly different and establishing them requires novel proof ideas. We also design algorithms for auditing proportional fairness of a given clustering solution. We conduct experiments on real data which suggest that traditional clustering algorithms are highly unfair, while our algorithms achieve strong fairness guarantees with a moderate loss in common clustering objectives.

Prospective Learning: Learning for a Dynamic Future
In real world applications, the distribution of the data and our goals, evolve over time. And we therefore care about performance over time, rather than just instantaneous performance. Yet, the prevailing theoretical framework in artificial intelligence (AI) is probably approximately correct (PAC), which ignores time. Existing strategies to address the dynamic nature of distributions and goals have typically not treated time formally, but rather, heuristically. We therefore enrich PAC learning to by assuming the data are sampled from a stochastic process, rather than a random variable, and adjust the loss accordingly. This generalizes the notion of learning to something we call "prospective learning". We prove that time-agnostic empirical risk minimization cannot solve certain trivially simple prospective learning problems. We then prove that a simple time-aware augmentation to empirical risk minimization provably solves certain prospective learning problems. Numerical experiments illustrate that a few different ways of incorporating time, including modifications of a transformer, lead to improved algorithms for prospective learning, including visual recognition tasks constructed from MNIST and CIFAR. This framework offers a conceptual link towards both (i) improving AI solutions for currently intractable problems, and (ii) better characterizing the naturally intelligent systems that solve them.

Prospective Representation Learning for Non-Exemplar Class-Incremental Learning
Non-exemplar class-incremental learning (NECIL) is a challenging task that requires recognizing both old and new classes without retaining any old class samples. Current works mainly deal with the conflicts between old and new classes retrospectively as a new task comes in. However, the lack of old task data makes balancing old and new classes difficult. Instead, we propose a Prospective Representation Learning (PRL) scheme to prepare the model for handling conflicts in advance. In the base phase, we squeeze the embedding distribution of the current classes to reserve space for forward compatibility with future classes. In the incremental phase, we make the new class features away from the saved prototypes of old classes in a latent space while aligning the current embedding space with the latent space when updating the model. Thereby, the new class features are clustered in the reserved space to minimize the shock of the new classes on the former classes. Our approach can help existing NECIL baselines to balance old and new classes in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code and models will be released.

Protein-Nucleic Acid Complex Modeling with Frame Averaging Transformer
Nucleic acid-based drugs like aptamers have recently demonstrated great therapeutic potential. However, experimental platforms for aptamer screening are costly, and the scarcity of labeled data presents a challenge for supervised methods to learn protein-aptamer binding. To this end, we develop an unsupervised learning approach based on the predicted pairwise contact map between a protein and a nucleic acid and demonstrate its effectiveness in protein-aptamer binding prediction. Our model is based on FAFormer, a novel equivariant transformer architecture that seamlessly integrates frame averaging (FA) within each transformer block. This integration allows our model to infuse geometric information into node features while preserving the spatial semantics of coordinates, leading to greater expressive power than standard FA models. Our results show that FAFormer outperforms existing equivariant models in contact map prediction across three protein complex datasets, with over 10% relative improvement. Moreover, we curate five real-world protein-aptamer interaction datasets and show that the contact map predicted by FAFormer serves as a strong binding indicator for aptamer screening.

Prototypical Hash Encoding for On-the-Fly Fine-Grained Category Discovery
In this paper, we study a practical yet challenging task, On-the-fly Category Discovery (OCD), aiming to online discover the newly-coming stream data that belong to both known and unknown classes, by leveraging only known category knowledge contained in labeled data. Previous OCD methods employ the hash-based technique to represent old/new categories by hash codes for instance-wise inference. However, directly mapping features into low-dimensional hash space not only inevitably damages the ability to distinguish classes and but also causes ``high sensitivity'' issue, especially for fine-grained classes, leading to inferior performance. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel Prototypical Hash Encoding (PHE) framework consisting of Category-aware Prototype Generation (CPG) and Discriminative Category Encoding (DCE) to mitigate the sensitivity of hash code while preserving rich discriminative information contained in high-dimension feature space, in a two-stage projection fashion. CPG enables the model to fully capture the intra-category diversity by representing each category with multiple prototypes. DCE boosts the discrimination ability of hash code with the guidance of the generated category prototypes and the constraint of minimum separation distance. By jointly optimizing CPG and DCE, we demonstrate that these two components are mutually beneficial towards an effective OCD. Extensive experiments show the significant superiority of our PHE over previous methods, e.g. obtaining an improvement of +5.3% in ALL ACC averaged on all datasets. Moreover, due to the nature of the interpretable prototypes, we visually analyze the underlying mechanism of how PHE helps group certain samples into either known or unknown categories.

ProTransformer: Robustify Transformers via Plug-and-Play Paradigm
Transformer-based architectures have dominated various areas of machine learning in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a novel robust attention mechanism designed to enhance the resilience of transformer-based architectures. Crucially, this technique can be integrated into existing transformers as a plug-and-play layer, improving their robustness without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our ProTransformer significantly enhances the robustness of transformer models across a variety of prediction tasks, attack mechanisms, backbone architectures, and data domains. Notably, without further fine-tuning, the ProTransformer consistently improves the performance of vanilla transformers by 19.5\%, 28.3\%, 16.1\%, and 11.4\% for BERT, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, respectively, under the classical TextFooler attack. Furthermore, ProTransformer shows promising resilience in large language models (LLMs) against prompting-based attacks, improving the performance of T5 and LLaMA by 24.8\% and 17.8\%, respectively, and enhancing Vicuna by an average of 10.4\% against the Jailbreaking attack. Beyond the language domain, ProTransformer also demonstrates outstanding robustness in both vision and graph domains.

Provable Acceleration of Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient for Asymmetric Matrix Factorization and Linear Neural Networks
We study the convergence rate of first-order methods for rectangular matrix factorization, which is a canonical nonconvex optimization problem. Specifically, given a rank-$r$ matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, we prove that gradient descent (GD) can find a pair of $\epsilon$-optimal solutions $\mathbf{X}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ and $\mathbf{Y}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, where $d\geq r$, satisfying $\lVert\mathbf{X}_T\mathbf{Y}_T^\top-\mathbf{A}\rVert_F\leq\epsilon\lVert\mathbf{A}\rVert_F$ in $T=O(\kappa^2\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ iterations with high probability, where $\kappa$ denotes the condition number of $\mathbf{A}$. Furthermore, we prove that Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) attains an iteration complexity of $O(\kappa\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$, which is the best-known bound of first-order methods for rectangular matrix factorization. Different from small balanced random initialization in the existing literature, we adopt an unbalanced initialization, where $\mathbf{X}_0$ is large and $\mathbf{Y}_0$ is $0$. Moreover, our initialization and analysis can be further extended to linear neural networks, where we prove that NAG can also attain an accelerated linear convergence rate. In particular, we only require the width of the network to be greater than or equal to the rank of the output label matrix. In contrast, previous results achieving the same rate require excessive widths that additionally depend on the condition number and the rank of the input data matrix.

Provable and Efficient Dataset Distillation for Kernel Ridge Regression
Deep learning models are now trained on increasingly larger datasets, making it crucial to reduce computational costs and improve data quality. Dataset distillation aims to distill a large dataset into a small synthesized dataset such that models trained on it can achieve similar performance to those trained on the original dataset. While there have been many empirical efforts to improve dataset distillation algorithms, a thorough theoretical analysis and provable, efficient algorithms are still lacking. In this paper, by focusing on dataset distillation for kernel ridge regression (KRR), we show that one data point per class is already necessary and sufficient to recover the original model's performance in many settings. For linear ridge regression and KRR with surjective feature mappings, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the distilled dataset to recover the original model's parameters. For KRR with injective feature mappings of deep neural networks, we show that while one data point per class is not sufficient in general, $k+1$ data points can be sufficient for deep linear neural networks, where $k$ is the number of classes. Our theoretical results enable directly constructing analytical solutions for distilled datasets, resulting in a provable and efficient dataset distillation algorithm for KRR. We verify our theory experimentally and show that our algorithm outperforms previous KIP while being significantly more efficient.

Provable Benefit of Cutout and CutMix for Feature Learning
Patch-level data augmentation techniques such as Cutout and CutMix have demonstrated significant efficacy in enhancing the performance of image-based tasks. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive. In this paper, we study two-layer neural networks trained using three distinct methods: vanilla training without augmentation, Cutout training, and CutMix training. Our analysis focuses on a feature-noise data model, which consists of several label-dependent features of varying rarity and label-independent noises of differing strengths. Our theorems demonstrate that Cutout training can learn features with low frequencies that vanilla training cannot, while CutMix training can even learn rarer features that Cutout cannot capture. From this, we establish that CutMix yields the highest test accuracy among the three. Our novel analysis reveals that CutMix training makes the network learn all features and noise vectors ``evenly'' regardless of the rarity and strength, which provides an interesting insight into understanding patch-level augmentation.

Provable Editing of Deep Neural Networks using Parametric Linear Relaxation
Ensuring that a DNN satisfies a desired property is critical when deploying DNNsin safety-critical applications. There are efficient methods that can verifywhether a DNN satisfies a property, as seen in the annual DNN verificationcompetition (VNN-COMP). However, the problem of provably editing a DNN tosatisfy a property remains challenging. We present HRDNN, the first efficienttechnique for provable editing of DNNs. Specifically, given a DNN $\mathcal{N}$with parameters $\theta$, input polytope $P$, and outputpolytope $Q$, HRDNN finds new parameters $\theta'$ such that $\forall\mathrm{x} \in P    . \mathcal{N}(\mathrm{x}; \theta') \in Q$while minimizing the changes $\lVert{\theta' - \theta}\rVert$.Given a DNN and a property it violates from the VNN-COMP benchmarks,HRDNN is able to provably edit the DNN to satisfy this property within45 seconds.HRDNN is efficientbecause it relaxes the NP-hard provable editing problem to solving a linearprogram (LP). The key contribution is the novel notion of Parametric Linear Relaxation,which enables HRDNN to construct tight bounds of the DNN that are parameterizedby the new parameters $\theta'$. We demonstrate that HRDNN is more efficient andeffective compared to prior DNN editing approaches a) using the VNN-COMPbenchmarks, b) by editing CIFAR10 and TinyImageNet image-recognition DNNs, andBERT sentiment-classification DNNs for local robustness, and c) by training aDNN to model a geodynamics process and satisfy physics constraints.

Provable Guarantees for Model Performance via Mechanistic Intepretability
In this work, we propose using mechanistic interpretability -- techniques for reverse engineering model weights into human-interpretable algorithms -- to derive and compactly prove formal guarantees on model performance.We prototype this approach by formally lower bounding the accuracy of 151 small transformers trained on a Max-of-$k$ task. We create 102 different computer-assisted proof strategies and assess their length and tightness of bound on each of our models. Using quantitative metrics, we show that shorter proofs seem to require and provide more mechanistic understanding, and that more faithful mechanistic understanding leads to tighter performance bounds. We confirm these connections by qualitatively examining a subset of our proofs.Finally, we identify compounding structureless noise as a key challenge for using mechanistic interpretability to generate compact proofs on model performance.

Provable Posterior Sampling with Denoising Oracles Through Tilted Transport
Score-based diffusion models have significantly advanced high-dimensional data generation across various domains, by learning a denoising oracle (or score) from datasets. From a Bayesian perspective, they offer a realistic modeling of data priors and facilitate solving inverse problems through posterior sampling.Although many heuristic methods have been developed recently for this purpose, they lack the quantitative guarantees needed in many scientific applications. This work addresses the topic from two perspectives. We first present a hardness result indicating that a generic method leveraging the prior denoising oracle for posterior sampling becomes infeasible as soon as the measurement operator is mildly ill-conditioned. We next develop the *tilted transport* technique, which leverages the quadratic structure of the log-likelihood in linear inverse problems in combination with the prior denoising oracle to exactly transform the original posterior sampling problem into a new one that is provably easier to sample from. We quantify the conditions under which the boosted posterior is strongly log-concave, highlighting how task difficulty depends on the condition number of the measurement matrix and the signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting general scheme is shown to match the best-known sampling methods for Ising models, and is further validated on high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models.

Provable Tempered Overfitting of Minimal Nets and Typical Nets
We study the overfitting behavior of fully connected Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with binary weights fitted to perfectly classify a noisy training set. We consider interpolation using both the smallest DNN (having the minimal number of weights) and a random interpolating DNN. For both learning rules, we prove overfitting is tempered.  Our analysis rests on a new bound on the size of a threshold circuit consistent with a partial function.

Provably Efficient Interactive-Grounded Learning with Personalized Reward
Interactive-Grounded Learning (IGL) [Xie et al., 2021] is a powerful framework in which a learner aims at maximizing unobservable rewards through interacting with an environment and observing reward-dependent feedback on the taken actions.To deal with personalized rewards that are ubiquitous in applications such as recommendation systems, Maghakian et al. [2022] study a version of IGL with context-dependent feedback, but their algorithm does not come with theoretical guarantees. In this work, we consider the same problem and provide the first provably efficient algorithms with sublinear regret under realizability. Our analysis reveals that the step-function estimator of prior work can deviate uncontrollably due to finite-sample effects. Our solution is a novel Lipschitz reward estimator which underestimates the true reward and enjoys favorable generalization performances. Building on this estimator, we propose two algorithms, one based on explore-then-exploit and the other based on inverse-gap weighting. We apply IGL to learning from image feedback and learning from text feedback, which are reward-free settings that arise in practice. Experimental results showcase the importance of using our Lipschitz reward estimator and the overall effectiveness of our algorithms.

Provably Faster Algorithms for Bilevel Optimization via Without-Replacement Sampling
Bilevel Optimization has experienced significant advancements recently with the introduction of new efficient algorithms. Mirroring the success in single-level optimization, stochastic gradient-based algorithms are widely used in bilevel optimization. However, a common limitation in these algorithms is the presumption of independent sampling, which can lead to increased computational costs due to the unique hyper-gradient structure in bilevel problems. To address this challenge, we study the example-selection strategy for bilevel optimization in this work. More specifically, we introduce a without-replacement sampling based algorithm which achieves a faster convergence rate compared to its counterparts that rely on independent sampling. Beyond the standard bilevel optimization formulation, we extend our discussion to conditional bilevel optimization and also two special cases: minimax and compositional optimization. Finally, we validate our algorithms over both synthetic and real-world applications. Numerical results clearly showcase the superiority of our algorithms.

Provably Robust Score-Based Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Plug-and-Play Image Reconstruction
In a great number of tasks in science and engineering, the goal is to infer an unknown image from a small number of noisy measurements collected from a known forward model describing certain sensing or imaging modality. Due to resource constraints, this image reconstruction task is often extremely ill-posed, which necessitates the adoption of expressive prior information to regularize the solution space. Score-based diffusion models, thanks to its impressive empirical success, have emerged as an appealing candidate of an expressive prior in image reconstruction. In order to accommodate diverse tasks at once, it is of great interest to develop efficient, consistent and robust algorithms that incorporate unconditional score functions of an image prior distribution in conjunction with flexible choices of forward models.This work develops an algorithmic framework for employing score-based diffusion models as an expressive data prior in nonlinear inverse problems with general forward models. Motivated by the plug-and-play framework in the imaging community, we introduce a diffusion plug-and-play method (DPnP) that alternatively calls two samplers, a proximal consistency sampler based solely on the likelihood function of the forward model, and a denoising diffusion sampler based solely on the score functions of the image prior. The key insight is that denoising under white Gaussian noise can be solved rigorously via both stochastic (i.e., DDPM-type) and deterministic (i.e., DDIM-type) samplers using the same set of score functions trained for generation. We establish both asymptotic and non-asymptotic performance guarantees of DPnP, and provide numerical experiments   to illustrate its promise in solving both linear and nonlinear image reconstruction tasks. To the best of our knowledge, DPnP is the first provably-robust posterior sampling method for nonlinear inverse problems using unconditional diffusion priors.

Proving Olympiad Algebraic Inequalities without Human Demonstrations
Solving Olympiad-level mathematical problems represents a significant advancement in machine intelligence and automated reasoning. Current machine learning methods, however, struggle to solve Olympiad-level problems beyond Euclidean plane geometry due to a lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. The challenge is even greater in algebraic systems, which involves infinite reasoning spaces within finite conditions. To address these issues, we propose \textit{AIPS}, an \textit{Algebraic Inequality Proving System} capable of autonomously generating complex inequality theorems and effectively solving Olympiad-level inequality problems without requiring human demonstrations. During proof search in a mixed reasoning manner, a value curriculum learning strategy on generated datasets is implemented to improve proving performance, demonstrating strong mathematical intuitions. On a test set of 20 International Mathematical Olympiad-level inequality problems, AIPS successfully solved 10, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, AIPS automatically generated a vast array of non-trivial theorems without human intervention, some of which have been evaluated by professional contestants and deemed to reach the level of the International Mathematical Olympiad. Notably, one theorem was selected as a competition problem in a major city 2024 Mathematical Olympiad.All the materials are available at {\it \href{https://sites.google.com/view/aips}{sites.google.com/view/aips}}.

ProvNeRF: Modeling per Point Provenance in NeRFs as a Stochastic Process
Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have gained popularity with multiple works showing promising results across various applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing works do not explicitly model the distribution of training camera poses or consequently, the triangulation quality, a key factor affecting reconstruction quality dating back to classical vision literature. We close this gap with ProvNeRF, an approach that models the provenance for each point -- i.e., the locations where it is likely visible -- of NeRFs as a stochastic process. We achieve this by extending implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE) to functional space with an optimizable objective. We show that modeling per-point provenance during the NeRF optimization enriches the model with information on triangulation leading to improvements in novel view synthesis and uncertainty estimation under the challenging sparse, unconstrained view setting against competitive baselines.

ProxyFusion: Face Feature Aggregation Through Sparse Experts
Face feature fusion is indispensable for robust face recognition, particularly in scenarios involving long-range, low-resolution media (unconstrained environments) where not all frames or features are equally informative. Existing methods often rely on large intermediate feature maps or face metadata information, making them incompatible with legacy biometric template databases that store pre-computed features. Additionally, real-time inference and generalization to large probe sets remains challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce a linear time proxy based sparse expert selection and pooling approach for context driven feature-set attention. Our approach is order invariant on the feature-set, generalizes to large sets, is compatible with legacy template stores, and utilizes significantly less parameters making it suitable real-time inference and edge use-cases. Through qualitative experiments, we demonstrate that ProxyFusion learns discriminative information for importance weighting of face features without relying on intermediate features. Quantitative evaluations on challenging low-resolution face verification datasets such as IARPA BTS3.1 and DroneSURF show the superiority of ProxyFusion in unconstrained long-range face recognition setting. Code and pretrained models will be released upon acceptance.

Prune and Repaint: Content-Aware Image Retargeting for any Ratio
Image retargeting is the task of adjusting the aspect ratio of images to suit different display devices or presentation environments. However, existing retargeting methods often struggle to balance the preservation of key semantics and image quality, resulting in either deformation or loss of important objects, or the introduction of local artifacts such as discontinuous pixels and inconsistent regenerated content. To address these issues, we propose a content-aware retargeting method called PruneRepaint. It incorporates semantic importance for each pixel to guide the identification of regions that need to be pruned or preserved in order to maintain key semantics. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive repainting module that selects image regions for repainting based on the distribution of pruned pixels and the proportion between foreground size and target aspect ratio, thus achieving local smoothness after pruning. By focusing on the content and structure of the foreground, our PruneRepaint approach adaptively avoids key content loss and deformation, while effectively mitigating artifacts with local repainting. We conduct experiments on the public RetargetMe benchmark and demonstrate through objective experimental results and subjective user studies that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms of preserving semantics and aesthetics, as well as better generalization across diverse aspect ratios. Code will be publicly available.

Pruning neural network models for gene regulatory dynamics using data and domain knowledge
The practical utility of machine learning models in the sciences often hinges on their interpretability. It is common to assess a model's merit for scientific discovery, and thus novel insights, by how well it aligns with already available domain knowledge - a dimension that is currently largely disregarded in the comparison of neural network models. While pruning can simplify deep neural network architectures and excels in identifying sparse models, as we show in the context of gene regulatory network inference, state-of-the-art techniques struggle with biologically meaningful structure learning. To address this issue, we propose DASH, a generalizable framework that guides network pruning by using domain-specific structural information in model fitting and leads to sparser, better interpretable models that are more robust to noise. Using both synthetic data with ground truth information, as well as real-world gene expression data, we show that DASH, using knowledge about gene interaction partners within the putative regulatory network, outperforms general pruning methods by a large margin and yields deeper insights into the biological systems being studied.

Pseudo-Private Data Guided Model Inversion Attacks
In model inversion attacks (MIAs), adversaries attempt to recover private training data by exploiting access to a well-trained target model. Recent advancements have improved MIA performance using a two-stage generative framework. This approach first employs a generative adversarial network to learn a fixed distributional prior, which is then used to guide the inversion process during the attack. However, in this paper, we observed a phenomenon that such a fixed prior would lead to a low probability of sampling actual private data during the inversion process due to the inherent distribution gap between the prior distribution and the private data distribution, thereby constraining attack performance. To address this limitation, we propose increasing the density around high-quality pseudo-private data—recovered samples through model inversion that exhibit characteristics of the private training data—by slightly tuning the generator. This strategy effectively increases the probability of sampling actual private data that is close to these pseudo-private data during the inversion process. After integrating our method, the generative model inversion pipeline is strengthened, leading to improvements over state-of-the-art MIAs. This paves the way for new research directions in generative MIAs.

Pseudo-Siamese Directional Transformers for Self-Supervised Real-World Denoising
Real-world image denoising remains a challenge task.  This paper studies self-supervised image denoising, requiring only noisy images captured in a single shot. We revamped  the blind-spot technique by leveraging the transformer's capability for long-range pixel interactions, which is crucial for effectively removing noise dependence in relating pixel--a requirement for achieving great performance for the blind-spot technique.  The proposed method integrates these elements with two key innovations: a directional self-attention (DSA) module using a half-plane grid for self-attention, creating a sophisticated blind-spot structure, and a Siamese architecture with mutual learning to mitigate the performance impacts from the restricted attention grid in DSA.  Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing self-supervised and clean-image-free methods. This combination of blind-spot and transformer techniques provides a natural synergy for tackling real-world image denoising challenges.

PSL: Rethinking and Improving Softmax Loss from Pairwise Perspective for Recommendation
Softmax Loss (SL) is widely applied in Recommender Systems (RS) and has demonstrated effectiveness. This work analyzes SL from a pairwise perspective, revealing two significant limitations: 1) the relationship between SL and conventional ranking metrics like DCG is not sufficiently tight; 2) SL is highly sensitive to false negative instances. Our analysis indicates that these limitations are primarily due to the use of the exponential function.To address these issues, this work extends SL to a new family of loss functions, termed Pairwise Softmax Loss (PSL), which replaces exponential function in SL with other appropriate activation functions. While the revision is light, we highlight three merits of PSL: 1) it serves as a tighter surrogate for DCG with suitable activations; 2) it better balances data contributions; and 3) it acts as a specific BPR loss enhanced by Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO). We further validate the effectiveness and robustness of PSL through empirical experiments.

PTQ4DiT: Post-training Quantization for Diffusion Transformers
The recent introduction of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image generation by using a different backbone architecture, departing from traditional U-Nets and embracing the scalable nature of transformers. Despite their advanced capabilities, the wide deployment of DiTs, particularly for real-time applications, is currently hampered by considerable computational demands at the inference stage. Post-training Quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a fast and data-efficient solution that can significantly reduce computation and memory footprint by using low-bit weights and activations. However, its applicability to DiTs has not yet been explored and faces non-trivial difficulties due to the unique design of DiTs. In this paper, we propose PTQ4DiT, a specifically designed PTQ method for DiTs. We discover two primary quantization challenges inherent in DiTs, notably the presence of salient channels with extreme magnitudes and the temporal variability in distributions of salient activation over multiple timesteps. To tackle these challenges, we propose Channel-wise Salience Balancing (CSB) and Spearmen's $\rho$-guided Salience Calibration (SSC). CSB leverages the complementarity property of channel magnitudes to redistribute the extremes, alleviating quantization errors for both activations and weights. SSC extends this approach by dynamically adjusting the balanced salience to capture the temporal variations in activation. Additionally, to eliminate extra computational costs caused by PTQ4DiT during inference, we design an offline re-parameterization strategy for DiTs. Experiments demonstrate that our PTQ4DiT successfully quantizes DiTs to 8-bit precision (W8A8) while preserving comparable generation ability and further enables effective quantization to 4-bit weight precision (W4A8) for the first time.

PuLID: Pure and Lightning ID Customization via Contrastive Alignment
We propose Pure and Lightning ID customization (PuLID), a novel tuning-free ID customization method for text-to-image generation. By incorporating a Lightning T2I branch with a standard diffusion one, PuLID introduces both contrastive alignment loss and accurate ID loss, minimizing disruption to the original model and ensuring high ID fidelity. Experiments show that PuLID achieves superior performance in both ID fidelity and editability. Another attractive property of PuLID is that the image elements (\eg, background, lighting, composition, and style) before and after the ID insertion are kept as consistent as possible

PureGen: Universal Data Purification for Train-Time Poison Defense via Generative Model Dynamics
Train-time data poisoning attacks threaten machine learning models by introducing adversarial examples during training, leading to misclassification. Current defense methods often reduce generalization performance, are attack-specific, and impose significant training overhead. To address this, we introduce a set of universal data purification methods using a stochastic transform, $\Psi(x)$, realized via iterative Langevin dynamics of Energy-Based Models (EBMs), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), or both. These approaches purify poisoned data with minimal impact on classifier generalization. Our specially trained EBMs and DDPMs provide state-of-the-art defense against various attacks (including Narcissus, Bullseye Polytope, Gradient Matching) on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, and CINIC-10, without needing attack or classifier-specific information. We discuss performance trade-offs and show that our methods remain highly effective even with poisoned or distributionally shifted generative model training data.

Pure Message Passing Can Estimate Common Neighbor for Link Prediction
Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have emerged as the {\em de facto} standard in graph representation learning. However, when it comes to link prediction, they are not always superior to simple heuristics such as Common Neighbor (CN). This discrepancy stems from a fundamental limitation: while MPNNs excel in node-level representation, they stumble with encoding the joint structural features essential to link prediction, like CN. To bridge this gap, we posit that, by harnessing the orthogonality of input vectors, pure message-passing can indeed capture joint structural features. Specifically, we study the proficiency of MPNNs in approximating CN heuristics. Based on our findings, we introduce the Message Passing Link Predictor (MPLP), a novel link prediction model. MPLP taps into quasi-orthogonal vectors to estimate link-level structural features, all while preserving the node-level complexities. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets from various domains, where our method consistently outperforms the baseline methods, establishing new state-of-the-arts.

PutnamBench: Evaluating Neural Theorem-Provers on the Putnam Mathematical Competition
We present PutnamBench, a new multilingual benchmark for evaluating the ability of neural theorem-provers to solve competition mathematics problems. PutnamBench consists of 1337 hand-constructed formalizations of 514 theorems sourced from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, the premier undergraduate-level mathematics competition in North America.  All the theorems have formalizations in Lean 4 and Isabelle; a substantial subset also has Coq formalizations. Proving the theorems requires significant problem-solving ability and proficiency in a broad range of topics taught in undergraduate mathematics courses. We use PutnamBench to evaluate several established neural and symbolic theorem-provers.  These approaches can only solve a handful of the PutnamBench problems, establishing the benchmark as a difficult open challenge for research on neural theorem-proving. PutnamBench is available at https://github.com/trishullab/PUTNAM.

QKFormer: Hierarchical Spiking Transformer using Q-K Attention
Spiking Transformers, which integrate Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformer architectures, have attracted significant attention due to their potential for low energy consumption and high performance. However, there remains a substantial gap in performance between SNNs and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To narrow this gap, we have developed QKFormer, a direct training spiking transformer with the following features: i) _Linear complexity and high energy efficiency_, the novel spike-form Q-K attention module efficiently models the token or channel attention through binary vectors and enables the construction of larger models. ii) _Multi-scale spiking representation_, achieved by a hierarchical structure with the different numbers of tokens across blocks. iii) _Spiking Patch Embedding with Deformed Shortcut (SPEDS)_, enhances spiking information transmission and integration, thus improving overall performance. It is shown that QKFormer achieves significantly superior performance over existing state-of-the-art SNN models on various mainstream datasets. Notably, with comparable size to Spikformer (66.34 M, 74.81\%), QKFormer (64.96 M) achieves a groundbreaking top-1 accuracy of **85.65\%** on ImageNet-1k, substantially outperforming Spikformer by **10.84\%**. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that directly training SNNs have exceeded 85\% accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

QT-ViT: Improving Linear Attention in ViT with Quadratic Taylor Expansion
Vision transformer model (ViT) is widely used and performs well in vision tasks due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, the time complexity and memory consumption increase quadratically with the number of input patches which limits the usage of ViT in real-world applications. Previous methods have employed linear attention to mitigate the complexity of the original self-attention mechanism at the expense of effectiveness. In this paper, we propose QT-ViT models that improve the previous linear self-attention using quadratic Taylor expansion. Specifically, we substitute the softmax-based attention with second-order Taylor expansion, and then accelerate the quadratic expansion by reducing the time complexity with a fast approximation algorithm. The proposed method capitalizes on the property of quadratic expansion to achieve superior performance while employing linear approximation for fast inference. Compared to previous studies of linear attention, our approach does not necessitate knowledge distillation or high-order attention residuals to facilitate the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed QT-ViTs, showcasing the state-of-the-art results. Particularly, the proposed QT-ViTs consistently surpass the previous SOTA EfficientViTs under different model sizes, and achieve a new Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and speed.

Qualitative Mechanism Independence
We define what it means for a joint probability distribution to be compatible with aset of independent causal mechanisms, at a qualitative level—or, more precisely with a directed hypergraph $\mathcal A$, which is the qualitative structure of a probabilistic dependency graph (PDG). When A represents a qualitative Bayesian network, QIM-compatibility with $\mathcal A$ reduces to satisfying the appropriate conditional independencies. But giving semantics to hypergraphs using QIM-compatibility lets us do much more. For one thing, we can capture functional dependencies. For another, we can capture important aspects of causality using compatibility: we can use compatibility to understand cyclic causal graphs, and to demonstrate structural compatibility, we must essentially produce a causal model. Finally, compatibility has deep connections to information theory. Applying compatibility to cyclic structures helps to clarify a longstanding conceptual issue in information theory.

Quality-Improved and Property-Preserved Polarimetric Imaging via Complementarily Fusing
Polarimetric imaging is a challenging problem in the field of polarization-based vision, since setting a short exposure time reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, making the degree of polarization (DoP) and the angle of polarization (AoP) severely degenerated, while if setting a relatively long exposure time, the DoP and AoP would tend to be over-smoothed due to the frequently-occurring motion blur. This work proposes a polarimetric imaging framework that can produce clean and clear polarized snapshots by complementarily fusing a degraded pair of noisy and blurry ones. By adopting a neural network-based three-phase fusing scheme with specially-designed modules tailored to each phase, our framework can not only improve the image quality but also preserve the polarization properties. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Quantifying Aleatoric Uncertainty of the Treatment Effect: A Novel Orthogonal Learner
Estimating causal quantities from observational data is crucial for understanding the safety and effectiveness of medical treatments. However, to make reliable inferences, medical practitioners require not only estimating averaged causal quantities, such as the conditional average treatment effect, but also understanding the randomness of the treatment effect as a random variable. This randomness is referred to as aleatoric uncertainty and is necessary for understanding the probability of benefit from treatment or quantiles of the treatment effect. Yet, the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect has received surprisingly little attention in the causal machine learning community. To fill this gap, we aim to quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect at the individualized (covariate-conditional) level, namely, the conditional distribution of the treatment effect (CDTE). Unlike average causal quantities, the CDTE is not point identifiable without strong additional assumptions. As a remedy, we employ partial identification to obtain sharp bounds on the CDTE and thereby quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect. We then develop a novel, orthogonal learner for the bounds on the CDTE, which we call AU-learner. We further show that our AU-learner has several strengths in that it satisfies Neyman-orthogonality and is doubly robust. Finally, we propose a fully-parametric deep learning instantiation of our AU-learner.

Quantifying and Optimizing Global Faithfulness in Persona-driven Role-playing
Persona-driven role-playing (PRP) aims to build AI characters that can respond to user queries by faithfully sticking with \emph{all} (factual) statements in persona documents.Unfortunately, existing faithfulness criteria for PRP are limited to coarse-grained LLM-based scoring without a clear definition or formulation.This paper presents a pioneering exploration to quantify PRP faithfulness evaluation as a fine-grained and explainable criterion, which also serves as a reliable reference for faithfulness optimization.Our criterion first discriminates persona statements into \emph{active} and \emph{passive} constraints by identifying the query-statement relevance.Then, we incorporate all constraints following the principle that the AI character's response should be (a) entailed by active constraints and (b) not contradicted by passive constraints.We translate this principle mathematically into a novel Active-Passive-Constraint (APC) score, a constraint-wise sum of statement-to-response natural language inference (NLI) scores weighted by constraint-query relevance scores. In practice, we build the APC scoring system by symbolically distilling small NLI and relevance discriminators (300M parameters) from GPT-4 for efficiency, and both show high consistency with GPT-4's discrimination.We validate the quality of the APC score against human evaluation based on example personas with tens of statements, and the results show a high correlation.As the APC score could faithfully reflect the PRP quality, we further leverage it as a reward system in direct preference optimization (DPO) for better AI characters. Our experiments offer a fine-grained and explainable comparison between existing PRP techniques, revealing their advantages and limitations.We further find APC-based DPO to be one of the most competitive techniques for sticking with all constraints and can be well incorporated with other techniques.We then extend the scale of the experiments to real persons with hundreds of statements and reach a consistent conclusion. Finally, we provide comprehensive analyses and case studies to support the effectiveness of APC and APC-based DPO.

Quantitative Convergences of Lie Group Momentum Optimizers
Explicit, momentum-based dynamics that optimize functions defined on Lie groups can be constructed via variational optimization and momentum trivialization. Structure preserving time discretizations can then turn this dynamics into optimization algorithms. This article investigates two types of discretization, Lie Heavy-Ball, which is a known splitting scheme, and Lie NAG-SC, which is newly proposed. Their convergence rates are explicitly quantified under $L$-smoothness and \emph{local} strong convexity assumptions. Lie NAG-SC provides acceleration over the momentumless case, i.e. Riemannian gradient descent, but Lie Heavy-Ball does not. When compared to existing accelerated optimizers for general manifolds, both Lie Heavy-Ball and Lie NAG-SC are computationally cheaper and easier to implement, thanks to their utilization of group structure. Only gradient oracle and exponential map are required, but not logarithm map or parallel transport which are computational costly.

Quasi-Bayes meets Vines
Recently proposed quasi-Bayesian (QB) methods \cite{fong2021martingale} initiated a new era in Bayesian computation by directly constructing the Bayesian predictive distribution through recursion, removing the need for expensive computations involved in sampling the Bayesian posterior distribution. This has proved to be data-efficient for univariate predictions, but extensions to multiple dimensions rely on a conditional decomposition resulting from predefined assumptions on the kernel of the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model, which is the implicit nonparametric model used. Here, we propose a different way to extend Quasi-Bayesian prediction to high dimensions through the use of Sklar's theorem by decomposing the predictive distribution into one-dimensional predictive marginals and a high-dimensional copula. Thus, we use the efficient recursive QB construction for the one-dimensional marginals and model the dependence using highly expressive vine copulas. Further, we tune hyperparameters using robust divergences (eg. energy score) and show that our proposed Quasi-Bayesian Vine (QB-Vine) is a fully non-parametric density estimator with \emph{an analytical form} and convergence rate independent of the dimension of data in some situations. Our experiments illustrate that the QB-Vine is appropriate for high dimensional distributions ($\sim$64), needs very few samples to train ($\sim$200) and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with analytical forms for density estimation and supervised tasks by a considerable margin.

QUEST: Quadruple Multimodal Contrastive Learning with Constraints and Self-Penalization
Multimodal contrastive learning (MCL) has recently demonstrated significant success across various tasks. However, the existing MCL treats all negative samples equally and ignores the potential semantic association with positive samples, which limits the model's ability to achieve fine-grained alignment. In multi-view scenarios, MCL tends to prioritize shared information while neglecting modality-specific unique information across different views, leading to feature suppression and suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel contrastive framework named QUEST: Quadruple Multimodal Contrastive Learning with Constraints and Self-Penalization. In the QUEST framework, we propose quaternion contrastive objectives and orthogonal constraints to extract sufficient unique information. Meanwhile, a shared information-guided penalization is introduced to ensure that shared information does not excessively influence the optimization of unique information. Our method leverages quaternion vector spaces to simultaneously optimize shared and unique information. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our method achieves superior performance in multimodal contrastive learning benchmarks. On public benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, and on synthetic shortcut datasets, we outperform existing baseline methods by an average of $97.95\%$ on the CLIP model.

QVAE-Mole: The Quantum VAE with Spherical Latent Variable Learning for 3-D Molecule Generation
Molecule generation ideally in its 3-D form has enjoyed wide applications in material, chemistry, life science, etc. We propose the first quantum parametric circuit for 3-D molecule generation for its potential quantum advantage especially considering the arrival of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. We choose the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) scheme for its simplicity and one-shot generation ability, which we believe is more quantum-friendly compared with the auto-regressive generative models or diffusion models as used in classic approaches. Specifically, we present a quantum encoding scheme designed for 3-D molecules with qubits complexity $\mathcal{O}(C\log n)$ ($n$ is the number of atoms) and adopt a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributed latent space to meet the inherent coherence of the quantum system. We further design to encode conditions into quantum circuits for property-specified generation. Experimentally, our model could generate plausible 3-D molecules and achieve competitive quantitative performance with significantly reduced circuit parameters compared with their classic counterparts. The source code will be released upon publication.

QWO: Speeding Up Permutation-Based Causal Discovery in LiGAMs
Causal discovery is essential for understanding relationships among variables of interest in many scientific domains. In this paper, we focus on permutation-based methods for learning causal graphs in Linear Gaussian Acyclic Models (LiGAMs), where the permutation encodes a causal ordering of the variables. Existing methods in this setting are not scalable due to their high computational complexity. These methods are comprised of two main components: (i) constructing a specific DAG, $\mathcal{G}^\pi$, for a given permutation $\pi$, which represents the best structure that can be learned from the available data while adhering to $\pi$, and (ii) searching over the space of permutations (i.e., causal orders) to minimize the number of edges in $\mathcal{G}^\pi$. We introduce QWO, a novel approach that significantly enhances the efficiency of computing $\mathcal{G}^\pi$ for a given permutation $\pi$. QWO has a speed-up of $O(n^2)$ ($n$ is the number of variables) compared to the state-of-the-art BIC-based method, making it highly scalable. We show that our method is theoretically sound and can be integrated into existing search strategies such as GRASP and hill-climbing-based methods to improve their performance.

RAGChecker: A Fine-grained Framework for Diagnosing Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Despite Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promising capability in leveraging external knowledge, a comprehensive evaluation of RAG systems is still challenging due to the modular nature of RAG, evaluation of long-form responses and reliability of measurements. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework, RAGChecker, that incorporates a suite of diagnostic metrics for both the retrieval and generation modules. Meta evaluation verifies that RAGChecker has significantly better correlations with human judgments than other evaluation metrics. Using RAGChecker, we evaluate 8 RAG systems and conduct an in-depth analysis of their performance, revealing insightful patterns and trade-offs in the design choices of RAG architectures. The metrics of RAGChecker can guide researchers and practitioners in developing more effective RAG systems.

RAGraph: A General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning Framework
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in interpreting relational data across various domains, yet, they often struggle to generalize to unseen graph data that differs markedly from training instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability.

RAMP: Boosting Adversarial Robustness Against Multiple $l_p$ Perturbations
Most existing works focus on improving robustness against adversarial attacks bounded by a single $l_p$ norm using adversarial training (AT). However, the multiple-norm robustness (union accuracy) of these AT models is still low. The tradeoffs among robustness against multiple $l_p$ perturbations and accuracy/robustness make obtaining good union and clean accuracy challenging. By analyzing the tradeoffs from the lens of distribution shifts, we design a logit pairing loss to improve the union accuracy. We connect natural training (NT) with AT via gradient projection, to incorporate useful information from NT into AT, where we empirically and theoretically show it moderates the accuracy/robustness tradeoff. Combining our contributions, we propose a training framework \textbf{RAMP}, to boost the robustness against multiple $l_p$ perturbations. We show \textbf{RAMP} can be easily adapted for both robust fine-tuning and full AT. For robust fine-tuning, \textbf{RAMP} obtains a union accuracy up to $53.5\%$ on CIFAR-10, and $29.5\%$ on ImageNet. For training from scratch, \textbf{RAMP} achieves a union accuracy of $44.6\%$ and good clean accuracy of $81.2\%$ on ResNet-18 against AutoAttack on CIFAR-10.

Random Cycle Coding: Lossless Compression of Cluster Assignments via Bits-Back Coding
We present an optimal method for encoding cluster assignments of arbitrary data sets. Our method, Random Cycle Coding (RCC), encodes data sequentially and sends assignment information as cycles of the permutation defined by the order of encoded elements. RCC does not require any training and its worst-case complexity scales quasi-linearly with the size of the largest cluster. We characterize the achievable bit rates as a function of cluster sizes and number of elements, showing RCC consistently outperforms previous methods while requiring less compute and memory resources. Experiments show RCC can save up to $2$ bytes per element when applied to vector databases, and removes the need for assigning integer ids to identify vectors, translating to savings of up to $70\%$ in vector database systems for similarity search applications.

Random Function Descent
Classical worst-case optimization theory neither explains the successof optimization in machine learning, nor does it help with step sizeselection.  We establish a connection between Bayesian Optimization (i.e.average case optimization theory) and classical optimization using a'stochastic Taylor approximation' to rediscover gradient descent. Thisrediscovery yields a step size schedule we call Random Function Descent(RFD), which, in contrast to classical derivations, is scale invariant.Furthermore, our analysis of RFD step sizes yields a theoretical foundationfor common step size heuristics such as gradient clipping and graduallearning rate warmup.  We finally propose a statistical procedure forestimating the RFD step size schedule and validate this theory with a casestudy on the MNIST dataset.

Randomized Strategic Facility Location with Predictions
We revisit the canonical problem of strategic facility location and study the power and limitations of randomization in the design of truthful mechanisms augmented with machine-learned predictions. In the strategic facility location problem, a set of agents are asked to report their locations in some metric space and the goal is to use these reported locations to determine where to open a new facility, aiming to optimize some aggregate measure of distance of the agents from that facility. However, the agents are strategic and can misreport their locations if this may lead to a facility location choice that they prefer. The goal is to design truthful mechanisms, which ensure the agents cannot benefit by misreporting. A lot of prior work has studied this problem from a worst-case perspective, but a recent line of work proposed a framework to refine these results when the designer is provided with some, possible incorrect, predictions regarding the agents' true locations. The goal is to simultaneously provide strong consistency guarantees (i.e., guarantees when the predictions provided to the mechanism are correct) and near-optimal robustness guarantees (i.e., guarantees that hold irrespective of how inaccurate the predictions may be). In this work we focus on the power of randomization in this problem and analyze the best approximation guarantees achievable with respect to the egalitarian social cost measure for one- and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces.

Random Representations Outperform Online Continually Learned Representations
Continual learning has primarily focused on the issue of catastrophic forgetting and the associated stability-plasticity tradeoffs. However, little attention has been paid to the efficacy of continually learned representations, as representations are learned alongside classifiers throughout the learning process. Our primary contribution is empirically demonstrating that existing online continually trained deep networks produce inferior representations compared to a simple pre-defined random transforms. Our approach embeds raw pixels using a fixed random transform, approximating an RBF-Kernel initialized before any data is seen. We then train a simple linear classifier on top without storing any exemplars, processing one sample at a time in an online continual learning setting. This method, called RanDumb,  significantly outperforms state-of-the-art continually learned representations across all standard online continual learning benchmarks. Our study reveals the significant limitations of representation learning, particularly in low-exemplar and online continual learning scenarios. Extending our investigation to popular exemplar-free scenarios with pretrained models, we find that training only a linear classifier on top of pretrained representations surpasses most continual fine-tuning and prompt-tuning strategies. Overall, our investigation challenges the prevailing assumptions about effective representation learning in the online continual learning.

Rapid Plug-in Defenders
In the realm of daily services, the deployment of deep neural networks underscores the paramount importance of their reliability. However, the vulnerability of these networks to adversarial attacks, primarily evasion-based, poses a concerning threat to their functionality. Common methods for enhancing robustness involve heavy adversarial training or leveraging learned knowledge from clean data, both necessitating substantial computational resources. This inherent time-intensive nature severely limits the agility of large foundational models to swiftly counter adversarial perturbations. To address this challenge, this paper focuses on the \textbf{Ra}pid \textbf{P}lug-\textbf{i}n \textbf{D}efender (\textbf{RaPiD}) problem, aiming to rapidly counter adversarial perturbations without altering the deployed model. Drawing inspiration from the generalization and the universal computation ability of pre-trained transformer models, we propose a novel method termed \textbf{CeTaD} (\textbf{C}onsidering Pr\textbf{e}-trained \textbf{T}ransformers \textbf{a}s \textbf{D}efenders) for RaPiD, optimized for efficient computation. \textbf{CeTaD} strategically fine-tunes the normalization layer parameters within the defender using a limited set of clean and adversarial examples. Our evaluation centers on assessing \textbf{CeTaD}'s effectiveness, transferability, and the impact of different components in scenarios involving one-shot adversarial examples. The proposed method is capable of rapidly adapting to various attacks and different application scenarios without altering the target model and clean training data. We also explore the influence of varying training data conditions on \textbf{CeTaD}'s performance. Notably, \textbf{CeTaD} exhibits adaptability across differentiable service models and proves the potential of continuous learning.

RAW: A Robust and Agile Plug-and-Play Watermark Framework for AI-Generated Images with Provable Guarantees
Safeguarding intellectual property and preventing potential misuse of AI-generated images are of paramount importance. This paper introduces a robust and agile plug-and-play watermark detection framework, referred to as RAW.As a departure from existing encoder-decoder methods, which incorporate fixed binary codes as watermarks within latent representations, our approach introduces learnable watermarks directly into the original image data. Subsequently, we employ a classifier that is jointly trained with the watermark to detect the presence of the watermark.The proposed framework is compatible with various generative architectures and supports on-the-fly watermark injection after training. By incorporating state-of-the-art smoothing techniques, we show that the framework also provides provable guarantees regarding the false positive rate for misclassifying a watermarked image, even in the presence of adversarial attacks targeting watermark removal. Experiments on a diverse range of images generated by state-of-the-art diffusion models demonstrate substantially improved watermark encoding speed and watermark detection performance, under adversarial attacks, while maintaining image quality.

RCDN: Towards Robust Camera-Insensitivity Collaborative Perception via Dynamic Feature-based 3D Neural Modeling
Collaborative perception is dedicated to tackling the constraints of single-agent perception, such as occlusions, based on the multiple agents' multi-view sensor inputs. However, most existing works assume an ideal condition that all agents' multi-view cameras are continuously available. In reality, cameras may be highly noisy, obscured or even failed during the collaboration. In this work, we introduce a new robust camera-insensitivity problem: how to overcome the issues caused by the failed camera perspectives, while stabilizing high collaborative performance with low calibration cost? To address above problems, we propose RCDN, a Robust Camera-insensitivity collaborative perception with a novel Dynamic feature-based 3D Neural modeling mechanism. The key intuition of RCDN is to construct collaborative neural rendering field representations to recover failed perceptual messages sent by multiple agents. To better model collaborative neural rendering field, RCDN first establishes a geometry BEV feature based time-invariant static field with other agents via fast hash grid modeling. Based on the static background field, the proposed time-varying dynamic field can model corresponding motion vector for foregrounds with appropriate positions. To validate RCDN, we create OPV2V-N, a new large-scale dataset with manual labelling under different camera failed scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on OPV2V-N show that RCDN can be ported to other baselines and improve their robustness in extreme camera-insensitivity setting. Our code and datasets will be available soon.

RClicks: Realistic Click Simulation for Benchmarking Interactive Segmentation
The emergence of Segment Anything (SAM) sparked research interest in the field of interactive segmentation, especially in the context of image editing tasks and speeding up data annotation. Unlike common semantic segmentation, interactive segmentation methods allow users to directly influence their output through prompts (e.g. clicks). However, click patterns in real-world interactive segmentation scenarios remain largely unexplored. Most methods rely on the assumption that users would click in the center of the largest erroneous area. Nevertheless, recent studies show that this is not always the case. Thus, methods may have poor performance in real-world deployment despite high metrics in a baseline benchmark. To accurately simulate real-user clicks, we conducted a large crowdsourcing study of click patterns in an interactive segmentation scenario and collected 475K real-user clicks. Drawing on ideas from saliency tasks, we develop a clickability model that enables sampling clicks, which closely resemble actual user inputs. Using our model and dataset, we propose RClicks benchmark for a comprehensive comparison of existing interactive segmentation methods on realistic clicks. Specifically, we evaluate not only the average quality of methods, but also the robustness w.r.t. click patterns. According to our benchmark, in real-world usage interactive segmentation models may perform worse than it has been reported in the baseline benchmark, and most of the methods are not robust. We believe that RClicks is a significant step towards creating interactive segmentation methods that provide the best user experience in real-world cases. All code and data are available in the supplementary materials.

RealCompo: Balancing Realism and Compositionality Improves Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
Diffusion models have achieved remarkable advancements in text-to-image generation. However, existing models still have many difficulties when faced with multiple-object compositional generation. In this paper, we propose ***RealCompo***, a new *training-free* and *transferred-friendly* text-to-image generation framework, which aims to leverage the respective advantages of text-to-image models and spatial-aware image diffusion models (e.g., layout, keypoints and segmentation maps) to enhance both realism and compositionality of the generated images. An intuitive and novel *balancer* is proposed to dynamically balance the strengths of the two models in denoising process, allowing plug-and-play use of any model without extra training. Extensive experiments show that our RealCompo consistently outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-image models and spatial-aware image diffusion models in multiple-object compositional generation while keeping satisfactory realism and compositionality of the generated images. Notably, our RealCompo can be seamlessly extended with a wide range of spatial-aware image diffusion models and stylized diffusion models.

Realizable $H$-Consistent and Bayes-Consistent Loss Functions for Learning to Defer
We present a comprehensive study of surrogate loss functions for learning to defer. We introduce a broad family of surrogate losses, parameterized by a non-increasing function $\Psi$, and establish their realizable $H$-consistency under mild conditions. For cost functions based on classification error, we further show that these losses admit $H$-consistency bounds when the hypothesis set is symmetric and complete, a property satisfied by common neural network and linear function hypothesis sets. Our results also resolve an open question raised in previous work [Mozannar et al., 2023] by proving the realizable $H$-consistency and Bayes-consistency of a specific surrogate loss. Furthermore, we identify choices of $\Psi$ that lead to $H$-consistent surrogate losses for *any general cost function*, thus achieving Bayes-consistency, realizable $H$-consistency, and $H$-consistency bounds *simultaneously*. We also investigate the relationship between $H$-consistency bounds and realizable $H$-consistency in learning to defer, highlighting key differences from standard classification. Finally, we empirically evaluate our proposed surrogate losses and compare them with existing baselines.

RealMAN: A Real-Recorded and Annotated Microphone Array Dataset for Dynamic Speech Enhancement and Localization
The training of deep learning-based multichannel speech enhancement and source localization systems relies heavily on the simulation of room impulse response and multichannel diffuse noise, due to the lack of large-scale real-recorded datasets. However, the acoustic mismatch between simulated and real-world data could degrade the model performance when applying in real-world scenarios. To bridge this simulation-to-real gap, this paper presents a new relatively large-scale Real-recorded and annotated Microphone Array speech&Noise (RealMAN) dataset. The proposed dataset is valuable in two aspects: 1) benchmarking speech enhancement and localization algorithms in real scenarios; 2) offering a substantial amount of real-world training data for potentially improving the performance of real-world applications. Specifically, a 32-channel array with high-fidelity microphones is used for recording. A loudspeaker is used for playing source speech signals. A total of 83-hour speech signals (48 hours for static speaker and 35 hours of moving speaker) are recorded in 32 different scenes, and 144 hours of background noise are recorded in 31 different scenes. Both speech and noise recording scenes cover various common indoor, outdoor, semi-outdoor and transportation environments, which enables the training of general-purpose speech enhancement and source localization networks. To obtain the task-specific annotations, the azimuth angle of the loudspeaker is annotated with an omni-direction fisheye camera by automatically detecting the loudspeaker. The direct-path signal is set as the target clean speech for speech enhancement, which is obtained by filtering the source speech signal with an estimated direct-path propagation filter. Baseline experiments demonstrate that i) compared to using simulated data, the proposed dataset is indeed able to train better speech enhancement and source localization networks; ii) using various sub-arrays of the proposed 32-channel microphone array can successfully train variable-array networks that can be directly used to unseen arrays.

realSEUDO for real-time calcium imaging analysis
Closed-loop neuroscience experimentation, where recorded neural activity is used to modify the experiment on-the-fly, is critical for deducing causal connections and optimizing experimental time. Thus while new optical methods permit on-line recording (via Multi-photon calcium imaging) and stimulation (via holographic stimulation) of large neural populations, a critical barrier in creating closed-loop experiments that can target and modulate single neurons is the real-time inference of neural activity from streaming recordings. In particular, while multi-photon calcium imaging (CI) is crucial in monitoring neural populations, extracting a single neuron's activity from the fluorescence videos often requires batch processing of the video data. Without batch processing, dimmer neurons and events are harder to identify and unrecognized neurons can create false positives when computing the activity of known neurons. We solve these issues by adapting a recently proposed robust time-trace estimator---Sparse Emulation of Unused Dictionary Objects (SEUDO) algorithm---as a basis for a new on-line processing algorithm that simultaneously identifies neurons in the fluorescence video and infers their time traces in a way that is robust to as-yet unidentified neurons. To achieve real-time SEUDO (realSEUDO), we introduce a combination of new algorithmic improvements, a fast C-based implementation, and a new cell finding loop to enable realSEUDO to identify new cells on-the-fly with no "warm-up" period. We demonstrate comparable performance to offline algorithms (e.g., CNMF), and improved performance over the current on-line approach (OnACID) at speeds of 120 Hz on average. This speed is faster than the typical 30 Hz framerate, leaving critical computation time for the computation of feedback in a closed-loop setting.

Real-time Core-Periphery Guided ViT with Smart Data Layout Selection on Mobile Devices
Mobile devices have become an essential enabler for AI applications, particularly in scenarios that require real-time performance. Vision Transformer (ViT) has become a fundamental cornerstone in this regard due to its high accuracy. Recent efforts have been dedicated to developing various Transformer architectures that offer improved accuracy while reducing the computational requirements. However, existing research primarily focuses on reducing theoretical computation size through methods such as local attention and model pruning, rather than considering realistic performance on mobile hardware. Although these optimizations reduce computational demands, they either introduce additional overheads related to data transformation (e.g., Reshape and Transpose) or irregular computation/data-access patterns. These result in significant overhead on the mobile devices due to their limited bandwidth, which even makes the latency worse than vanilla ViT on mobile. In this paper, we present ECP-ViT, a real-time framework that employs the core-periphery principle inspired by the brain functional networks to guide self-attention in ViTs and enables the deployment of ViT models on smartphones. We identify the main bottleneck in Transformer structures caused by data transformation and propose a hardware-friendly core-periphery guided self-attention to decrease computation demands. Additionally, we design comprehensive systematic optimizations to completely eliminate the need for data transformation operations. ECP-ViT with proposed algorithm-system co-optimizations achieve a speedup of  4.6x to 26.9x on mobile GPU across four datasets (STL-10, CIFAR100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet).

Real-Time Recurrent Learning using Trace Units in Reinforcement Learning
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used to learn representations in partially observable environments. For agents that learn online and continually interact with the environment, it is desirable to train RNNs with real-time recurrent learning (RTRL); unfortunately, RTRL is prohibitively expensive for standard RNNs. A promising direction is to use linear recurrent architectures (LRUs), where dense recurrent weights are replaced with a complex-valued diagonal, making RTRL efficient. In this work, we build on these insights to provide a lightweight but effective approach for training RNNs in online RL. We introduce Recurrent Trace Units (RTUs), a small modification on LRUs that we nonetheless find to have significant performance benefits over LRUs when trained with RTRL. We find RTUs significantly outperform GRUs and Transformers across several partially observable environments while using significantly less computation.

Real-Time Selection Under General Constraints via Predictive Inference
Real-time decision-making gets more attention in the big data era. Here, we consider the problem of sample selection in the online setting, where one encounters a possibly infinite sequence of individuals collected over time with covariate information available. The goal is to select samples of interest that are characterized by their unobserved responses until the user-specified stopping time. We derive a new decision rule that enables us to find more preferable samples that meet practical requirements by simultaneously controlling two types of general constraints: individual and interactive constraints, which include the widely utilized False Selection Rate (FSR), cost limitations, and diversity of selected samples. The key elements of our approach involve quantifying the uncertainty of response predictions via predictive inference and addressing individual and interactive constraints in a sequential manner. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in controlling both individual and interactive constraints.

Real-world Image Dehazing with Coherence-based Pseudo Labeling and Cooperative Unfolding Network
Real-world Image Dehazing (RID) aims to alleviate haze-induced degradation in real-world settings. This task remains challenging due to the complexities in accurately modeling real haze distributions and the scarcity of paired real-world data. To address these challenges, we first introduce a cooperative unfolding network that jointly models atmospheric scattering and image scenes, effectively integrating physical knowledge into deep networks to restore haze-contaminated details. Additionally, we propose the first RID-oriented iterative mean-teacher framework, termed the Coherence-based Label Generator, to generate high-quality pseudo labels for network training. Specifically, we provide an optimal label pool to store the best pseudo-labels during network training, leveraging both global and local coherence to select high-quality candidates and assign weights to prioritize haze-free regions. We verify the effectiveness of our method, with experiments demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on RID tasks.

Reasoning Multi-Agent Behavioral Topology for Interactive Autonomous Driving
Autonomous driving system aims for safe and social-consistent driving through the behavioral integration among interactive agents. However, challenges remain due to multi-agent scene uncertainty and heterogeneous interaction. Current dense and sparse behavioral representations struggle with inefficiency and inconsistency in multi-agent modeling, leading to instability of collective behavioral patterns when integrating prediction and planning (IPP). To address this, we initiate a topological formation that serves as a compliant behavioral foreground to guide downstream trajectory generations. Specifically, we introduce Behavioral Topology (BeTop), a pivotal topological formulation that explicitly represents the consensual behavioral pattern among multi-agent future. BeTop is derived from braid theory to distill compliant interactive topology from multi-agent future trajectories. A synergistic learning framework (BeTopNet) supervised by BeTop facilitates the consistency of behavior prediction and planning within the predicted topology priors. Through imitative contingency learning, BeTop also effectively manages behavioral uncertainty for prediction and planning. Extensive verification on large-scale real-world datasets, including nuPlan and WOMD, demonstrates that \algname achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction and planning tasks. Further validations on the proposed interactive scenario benchmark showcase planning compliance in interactive cases. Code and model would be made public.

Reawakening knowledge: Anticipatory recovery from catastrophic interference via structured training
We explore the training dynamics of neural networks in a structured non-IID setting where documents are presented cyclically in a fixed, repeated sequence. Typically, networks suffer from catastrophic interference when training on a sequence of documents; however, we discover a curious and remarkable property of LLMs finetuned sequentially in this setting: they exhibit *anticipatory* behavior, recovering from the forgetting on documents *before* seeing them again. The behavior emerges and becomes more robust as the architecture scales up its number of parameters. Through comprehensive experiments and visualizations, we uncover new insights into training over-parameterized networks in structured environments.

Reconstruct and Match: Out-of-Distribution Robustness via Topological Homogeneity
Since deep learning models are usually deployed in non-stationary environments, it is imperative to improve their robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. A common approach to mitigate distribution shift is to regularize internal representations or predictors learned from in-distribution (ID) data to be domain invariant. Past studies have primarily learned pairwise invariances, ignoring the intrinsic structure and high-order dependencies of the data. Unlike machines, human recognizes objects by first dividing them into major components and then identifying the topological relation of these components. Motivated by this, we propose Reconstruct and Match (REMA), a general learning framework for object recognition tasks to endow deep models with the capability of capturing the topological homogeneity of objects without human prior knowledge or fine-grained annotations. To identify major components from objects, REMA introduces a selective slot-based reconstruction module to dynamically map dense pixels into a sparse and discrete set of slot vectors in an unsupervised manner. Then, to model high-order dependencies among these components, we propose a hypergraph-based relational reasoning module that models the intricate relations of nodes (slots) with structural constraints. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that REMA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in OOD generalization and test-time adaptation settings.

Reconstructing the Image Stitching Pipeline: Integrating Fusion and Rectangling into a Unified Inpainting Model
Deep learning-based image stitching pipelines are typically divided into three cascading stages: registration, fusion, and rectangling. Each stage requires its own network training and is tightly coupled to the others, leading to error propagation and posing significant challenges to parameter tuning and system stability. This paper proposes the Simple and Robust Stitcher (SRStitcher), which revolutionizes the image stitching pipeline by simplifying the fusion and rectangling stages into a unified inpainting model, requiring no model training or fine-tuning. We reformulate the problem definitions of the fusion and rectangling stages and demonstrate that they can be effectively integrated into an inpainting task. Furthermore, we design the weighted masks to guide the reverse process in a pre-trained large-scale diffusion model, implementing this integrated inpainting task in a single inference. Through extensive experimentation, we verify the interpretability and generalization capabilities of this unified model, demonstrating that SRStitcher outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and stability.

Reconstruction Attacks on Machine Unlearning: Simple Models are Vulnerable
Machine unlearning is motivated by principles of data autonomy. The premise is that a person can request to have their data's influence removed from deployed models, and those models should be updated as if they were retrained without the person's data. We show that these updates expose individuals to high-accuracy reconstruction attacks which allow the attacker to recover their data in its entirety, even when the original models are so simple that privacy risk might not otherwise have been a concern. We show how to mount a near-perfect attack on the deleted data point from linear regression models. We then generalize our attack to other loss functions and architectures,  and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks across a wide range of datasets (capturing both tabular and image data). Our work highlights that privacy risk is significant even for extremely simple model classes when individuals can request deletion of their data from the model.

RectifID: Personalizing Rectified Flow with Anchored Classifier Guidance
Customizing diffusion models to generate identity-preserving images from user-provided reference images is an intriguing new problem. The prevalent approaches typically require training on extensive domain-specific images to achieve identity preservation, which lacks flexibility across different use cases. To address this issue, we exploit classifier guidance, a training-free technique that steers diffusion models using an existing classifier, for personalized image generation. Our study shows that based on a recent rectified flow framework, the major limitation of vanilla classifier guidance in requiring a special classifier can be resolved with a simple fixed-point solution, allowing flexible personalization with off-the-shelf image discriminators. Moreover, its solving procedure proves to be stable when anchored to a reference flow trajectory, with a convergence guarantee. The derived method is implemented on rectified flow with different off-the-shelf image discriminators, delivering advantageous personalization results for human faces, live subjects, and certain objects. Code is available at https://github.com/anonymous-6880/RectifID.

Recurrent Complex-Weighted Autoencoders for Unsupervised Object Discovery
Current state-of-the-art synchrony-based models encode object bindings with complex-valued activations and compute with real-valued weights in feedforward architectures. We argue for the computational advantages of a recurrent architecture with complex-valued weights. We propose a fully convolutional autoencoder, SynCx, that performs iterative constraint satisfaction: at each iteration, a hidden layer bottleneck encodes statistically regular configurations of features in particular phase relationships; over iterations, local constraints propagate and the model converges to a globally consistent configuration of phase assignments. Binding is achieved simply by the matrix-vector product operation between complex-valued weights and activations, without the need for additional mechanisms that have been incorporated into current synchrony-based models. SynCx outperforms or is strongly competitive with current models for unsupervised object discovery. SynCx also avoids certain systematic grouping errors of current models, such as the inability to separate similarly colored objects without additional supervision.

Recurrent neural network dynamical systems for biological vision
In neuroscience, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are modeled as continuous-time dynamical systems to more accurately reflect the dynamics inherent in biological circuits. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the preferred architecture in vision neuroscience due to their ability to efficiently process visual information, which comes at the cost of the biological realism provided by RNNs. To address this, we introduce a hybrid architecture that integrates the continuous-time recurrent dynamics of RNNs with the spatial processing capabilities of CNNs. Our models preserve the dynamical characteristics typical of RNNs while having comparable performance with their conventional CNN counterparts on benchmarks like ImageNet. Compared to conventional CNNs, our models demonstrate increased robustness to noise due to noise-suppressing mechanisms inherent in recurrent dynamical systems. Analyzing our architecture as a dynamical system is computationally expensive, so we develop a toolkit consisting of iterative and dimensionality-reduction methods specifically tailored for convolutional structures. We also train multi-area RNNs using our architecture as the front-end to perform complex cognitive tasks previously impossible to learn or achievable only with oversimplified stimulus representations. In monkey neural recordings, our models capture time-dependent variations in neural activity in higher-order visual areas. Together, these contributions represent a comprehensive foundation to unify the advances of CNNs and dynamical RNNs in vision neuroscience.

Recurrent neural networks: vanishing and exploding gradients are not the end of the story
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) notoriously struggle to learn long-term memories, primarily due to vanishing and exploding gradients. The recent success of state-space models (SSMs), a subclass of RNNs, to overcome such difficulties challenges our theoretical understanding. In this paper, we delve into the optimization challenges of RNNs and discover that, as the memory of a network increases, changes in its parameters result in increasingly large output variations, making gradient-based learning highly sensitive, even without exploding gradients. Our analysis further reveals the importance of the element-wise recurrence design pattern combined with careful parametrizations in mitigating this effect. This feature is present in SSMs, as well as in other architectures, such as LSTMs. Overall, our insights provide a new explanation for some of the difficulties in gradient-based learning of RNNs and why some architectures perform better than others.

Recurrent Reinforcement Learning with Memoroids
Memory models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers address Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) by mapping trajectories to latent Markov states. Neither model scales particularly well to long sequences, especially compared to an emerging class of memory models called Linear Recurrent Models. We discover that the recurrent update of these models resembles a monoid, leading us to reformulate existing models using a novel monoid-based framework that we call memoroids. We revisit the traditional approach to batching in recurrent reinforcement learning, highlighting theoretical and empirical deficiencies. We leverage memoroids to propose a batching method that improves sample efficiency, increases the return, and simplifies the implementation of recurrent loss functions in reinforcement learning.

Recursive PAC-Bayes: A Frequentist Approach to Sequential Prior Updates with No Information Loss
PAC-Bayesian analysis is a frequentist framework for incorporating prior knowledge into learning. It was inspired by Bayesian learning, which allows sequential data processing and naturally turns posteriors from one processing step into priors for the next. However, despite two and a half decades of research, the ability to update priors sequentially without losing confidence information along the way remained elusive for PAC-Bayes. While PAC-Bayes allows construction of data-informed priors, the final confidence intervals depend only on the number of points that were not used for the construction of the prior, whereas confidence information in the prior, which is related to the number of points used to construct the prior, is lost. This limits the possibility and benefit of sequential prior updates, because the final bounds depend only on the size of the final batch.    We present a novel and, in retrospect, surprisingly simple and powerful PAC-Bayesian procedure that allows sequential prior updates with no information loss. The procedure is based on a novel decomposition of the expected loss of randomized classifiers. The decomposition rewrites the loss of the posterior as an excess loss relative to a downscaled loss of the prior plus the downscaled loss of the prior, which is bounded recursively. As a side result, we also present a generalization of the split-kl and PAC-Bayes-split-kl inequalities to discrete random variables, which we use for bounding the excess losses, and which can be of independent interest. In empirical evaluation the new procedure significantly outperforms state-of-the-art.

REDUCR: Robust Data Downsampling using Class Priority Reweighting
Modern machine learning models are becoming increasingly expensive to train for real-world image and text classification tasks, where massive web-scale data is collected in a streaming fashion. To reduce the training cost, online batch selection techniques have been developed to choose the most informative datapoints. However, many existing techniques are not robust to class imbalance and distributional shifts, and can suffer from poor worst-class generalization performance. This work introduces REDUCR, a robust and efficient data downsampling method that uses class priority reweighting. REDUCR reduces the training data while preserving worst-class generalization performance. REDUCR assigns priority weights to datapoints in a class-aware manner using an online learning algorithm. We demonstrate the data efficiency and robust performance of REDUCR on vision and text classification tasks. On web-scraped datasets with imbalanced class distributions, REDUCR significantly improves worst-class test accuracy (and average accuracy), surpassing state-of-the-art methods by around 15\%.

Referencing Where to Focus: Improving Visual Grounding with Referential Query
Visual Grounding aims to localize the referring object in an image given a natural language expression. Recent advancements in DETR-based visual grounding methods have attracted considerable attention, as they directly predict the coordinates of the target object without relying on additional efforts, such as pre-generated proposal candidates or pre-defined anchor boxes. However, existing research primarily focuses on designing stronger multi-modal decoder, which typically generates learnable queries by random initialization or by using linguistic embeddings.  This vanilla query generation approach inevitably increases the learning difficulty for the model, as it does not involve any target-related information at the beginning of decoding. Furthermore, they only use the deepest image feature during the query learning process, overlooking the importance of features from other levels. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, called RefFormer. It consists of the query adaption module that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP and generate the referential query to provide the prior context for decoder, along with a task-specific decoder. By incorporating the referential query into the decoder, we can effectively mitigate the learning difficulty of the decoder, and accurately concentrate on the target object. Additionally, our proposed query adaption module can also act as an adapter, preserving the rich knowledge within CLIP without the need to tune the parameters of the backbone network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on five visual grounding benchmarks.

Referring Human Pose and Mask Estimation In the Wild
We introduce Referring Human Pose and Mask Estimation (R-HPM) in the wild, where either a text or positional prompt specifies the person of interest in an image. This new task holds significant potential for applications such as assistive robotics and sports analysis. In contrast to previous works, R-HPM (i) ensures high-quality, identity-aware results corresponding to the referred person, and (ii) simultaneously predicts human pose and mask for a comprehensive representation. To this end, we introduce a large-scale dataset named RefHuman, which extends the MS COCO dataset with additional text and positional prompt annotations. RefHuman includes over 50K annotated instances in the wild, each equipped with keypoint, mask, and prompt annotations. To enable prompt-conditioned estimation, we propose the first end-to-end promptable approach named UniPHD for R-HPM. UniPHD extracts multimodal representations and employs a proposed pose-centric hierarchical decoder to model (text or positional) instance queries and keypoint queries, producing results specific to the referred person. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniPHD produces quality results based on prompts and achieves top-ranked performance on RefHuman val and MS COCO val2017. The anonymous download link for our RefHuman dataset is provided in the Appendix for review, and we will make both the dataset and the code public upon paper acceptance.

ReFIR: Grounding Large Restoration Models with Retrieval Augmentation
Recent advances in diffusion-based Large Restoration Models (LRMs) have significantly improved photo-realistic image restoration by leveraging the internal knowledge embedded within model weights. However, existing LRMs often suffer from the hallucination dilemma, i.e., producing incorrect contents or textures when dealing with severe degradations, due to their heavy reliance on limited internal knowledge. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal solution called the Retrieval-augmented Framework for Image Restoration (ReFIR), which incorporates retrieved images as external knowledge to extend the knowledge boundary of existing LRMs in generating details faithful to the original scene.  Specifically, we first introduce the nearest neighbor lookup to retrieve content-relevant high-quality images as reference, after which we propose the cross-image injection to modify existing LRMs to utilize high-quality textures from retrieved images. Thanks to the additional external knowledge, our ReFIR can well handle the hallucination challenge and facilitate faithfully results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReFIR can achieve not only high-fidelity but also realistic restoration results. Importantly, our ReFIR requires no training and is adaptable to various LRMs.

ReF-LDM: A Latent Diffusion Model for Reference-based Face Image Restoration
While recent works on blind face image restoration have successfully produced impressive high-quality (HQ) images with abundant details from low-quality (LQ) input images, the generated content may not accurately reflect the real appearance of a person. To address this problem, incorporating well-shot personal images as additional reference inputs may be a promising strategy. Inspired by the recent success of the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) in image generation, we propose ReF-LDM—an adaptation of LDM designed to generate HQ face images conditioned on one LQ image and multiple HQ reference images. Our LDM-based model incorporates an effective and efficient mechanism, CacheKV, for conditioning on reference images. Additionally, we design a timestep-scaled identity loss, enabling LDM to focus on learning the discriminating features of human faces. Lastly, we construct FFHQ-ref, a dataset consisting of 20,406 high-quality (HQ) face images with corresponding reference images, which can serve as both training and evaluation data for reference-based face restoration models.

RegExplainer: Generating Explanations for Graph Neural Networks in Regression Tasks
Graph regression is a fundamental task that has gained significant attention in various graph learning tasks.However, the inference process is often not easily interpretable. Current explanation techniques are limited to understanding GNN behaviors in classification tasks, leaving an explanation gap for graph regression models. In this work, we propose a novel explanation method to interpret the graph regression models (XAIG-R). Our method addresses the distribution shifting problem and continuously ordered decision boundary issues that hinder existing methods away from being applied in regression tasks.We introduce a novel objective based on the graph information bottleneck theory (GIB) and a new mix-up framework, which could support various GNNs and explainers in a model-agnostic manner. Additionally, we present a self-supervised learning strategy to tackle the continuously ordered labels in regression tasks. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets and a real-life dataset introduced by us, and extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in interpreting GNN models in regression tasks.

Regret Minimization in Stackelberg Games with Side Information
Algorithms for playing in Stackelberg games have been deployed in real-world domains including airport security, anti-poaching efforts, and cyber-crime prevention. However, these algorithms often fail to take into consideration the additional information available to each player (e.g. traffic patterns, weather conditions, network congestion), a salient feature of reality which may significantly affect both players' optimal strategies. We formalize such settings as Stackelberg games with side information, in which both players observe an external context before playing. The leader commits to a (context-dependent) strategy, and the follower best-responds to both the leader's strategy and the context. We focus on the online setting in which a sequence of followers arrive over time, and the context may change from round-to-round. In sharp contrast to the non-contextual version, we show that it is impossible for the leader to achieve good performance (measured by regret) in the full adversarial setting.  Motivated by our impossibility result, we show that no-regret learning is possible in two natural relaxations: the setting in which the sequence of followers is chosen stochastically and the sequence of contexts is adversarial, and the setting in which the sequence of contexts is stochastic and the sequence of followers is chosen by an adversary.

ReGS: Reference-based Controllable Scene Stylization with Gaussian Splatting
Referenced-based scene stylization that edits the appearance based on a content-aligned reference image is an emerging research area. Starting with a pretrained neural radiance field (NeRF), existing methods typically learn a novel appearance that matches the given style. Despite their effectiveness, they inherently suffer from time-consuming volume rendering, and thus are impractical for many real-time applications. In this work, we propose ReGS, which adapts 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reference-based stylization to enable real-time stylized view synthesis. Editing the appearance of a pretrained 3DGS is challenging as it uses discrete Gaussians as 3D representation, which tightly bind appearance with geometry. Simply optimizing the appearance as prior methods do is often insufficient for modeling continuous textures in the given reference image. To address this challenge, we propose a novel texture-guided control mechanism that adaptively adjusts local responsible Gaussians to a new geometric arrangement, serving for desired texture details. The proposed process is guided by texture clues for effective appearance editing, and regularized by scene depth for preserving original geometric structure. With these novel designs, we show ReGs can produce state-of-the-art stylization results that respect the reference texture while embracing real-time rendering speed for free-view navigation. Code will be made public after the review process.

Regularized Conditional Diffusion Model for Multi-Task Preference Alignment
Sequential decision-making can be formulated as a conditional generation process, with targets for alignment with human intents and versatility across various tasks. Previous return-conditioned diffusion models manifest comparable performance but rely on well-defined reward functions, which requires amounts of human efforts and faces challenges in multi-task settings. Preferences serve as an alternative but recent work rarely considers preference learning given multiple tasks. To facilitate the alignment and versatility in multi-task preference learning, we adopt multi-task preferences as a unified framework. In this work, we propose to learn preference representations aligned with preference labels, which are then used as conditions to guide the conditional generation process of diffusion models. The traditional classifier-free guidance paradigm suffers from the inconsistency between the conditions and generated trajectories. We thus introduce an auxiliary regularization objective to maximize the mutual information between conditions and corresponding generated trajectories, improving their alignment with preferences. Experiments in D4RL and Meta-World demonstrate the effectiveness and favorable performance of our method in single- and multi-task scenarios.

Reimagining Mutual Information for Enhanced Defense against Data Leakage in Collaborative Inference
Edge-cloud collaborative inference empowers resource-limited IoT devices to support deep learning applications without disclosing their raw data to the cloud server, thus protecting user's data. Nevertheless, prior research has shown that collaborative inference still results in the exposure of input and predictions from edge devices. To defend against such data leakage in collaborative inference, we introduce InfoScissors, a defense strategy designed to reduce the mutual information between a model's intermediate outcomes and the device's input and predictions. We evaluate our defense on several datasets in the context of diverse attacks. Besides the empirical comparison, we provide a theoretical analysis of the inadequacies of recent defense strategies that also utilize mutual information, particularly focusing on those based on the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) approach. We illustrate the superiority of our method and offer a theoretical analysis of it.

Reinforcement Learning Gradients as Vitamin for Online Finetuning Decision Transformers
Decision Transformers have recently emerged as a new and compelling paradigm for offline Reinforcement Learning (RL), completing a trajectory in an autoregressive way. While improvements have been made to overcome  initial shortcomings, online finetuning of decision transformers has been surprisingly under-explored. The widely adopted state-of-the-art Online Decision Transformer (ODT) still struggles when pretrained with low-reward offline data. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the online-finetuning of the decision transformer,  showing that the commonly used Return-To-Go (RTG) that's far from the expected return hampers the online fine-tuning process. This problem, however, is well-addressed by the value function and advantage of standard RL algorithms. As suggested by our analysis, in our experiments, we hence find that simply adding TD3 gradients to the finetuning process of ODT effectively improves the online finetuning performance of ODT, especially if ODT is pretrained with low-reward offline data. These findings provide new directions to further improve decision transformers.

Rejection via Learning Density Ratios
Classification with rejection emerges as a learning paradigm which allows models to abstain from making predictions. The predominant approach is to alter the supervised learning pipeline by augmenting typical loss functions, letting model rejection incur a lower loss than an incorrect prediction.Instead, we propose a different distributional perspective, where we seek to find an idealized data distribution which maximizes a pretrained model's performance.This can be formalized via the optimization of a loss's risk with a $ \phi$-divergence regularization term.Through this idealized distribution, a rejection decision can be made by utilizing the density ratio between this distribution and the data distribution.We focus on the setting where our $ \phi $-divergences are specified by the family of $ \alpha $-divergence.Our framework is tested empirically over clean and noisy datasets.

Relation-Driven Diffusion for Human-Object Interaction Detection
Prevalent human-object interaction (HOI) detection approaches typically leverage large-scale visual-linguistic models to help recognize events involving humans and objects. Though promising, models trained via contrastive learning on text-image pairs often neglect mid/low-level visual cues and struggle at compositional reasoning. In response, we introduce DIFFUSIONHOI, a new HOI detector shedding light on text-to-image diffusion models. Unlike the aforementioned models, diffusion models excel in discerning mid/low-level visual concepts as generative models, and possess strong compositionality to handle novel concepts expressed in text inputs. Considering diffusion models usually emphasize instance objects, we first devise an inversion-based strategy to learn the expression of relation patterns between humans and objects in embedding space. These learned relation embeddings then serve as textual prompts, to steer diffusion models generate images that depict specific interactions, and extract HOI-relevant cues from images without heavy finetuning. Benefited from above, DIFFUSIONHOI achieves SOTA performance on three datasets under both regular and zero-shot setups. Our code shall be released.

RelBench: A Benchmark for Deep Learning on Relational Databases
We present RelBench, a public benchmark for solving predictive tasks in relational databases with deep learning.  RelBench provides databases and tasks spanning diverse domains, scales, and database dimensions, and is intended to be a foundational infrastructure for future research in this direction. We use RelBench to conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of graph neural network (GNN) based predictive models on relational data, as recently proposed by Fey et al. 2024.  End-to-end learned GNNs are capable fully exploiting the predictive signal encoded in links between entities, marking a significant shift away from the dominant paradigm of manual feature engineering combined with tabular machine learning. To thoroughly evaluate GNNs against the prior gold-standard we conduct a user study, where an experienced data scientist manually engineers features for each task. In this study, GNNs learn better models whilst reducing human work needed by more than an order of magnitude. This result demonstrates the power of GNNs for solving predictive tasks in relational databases, opening up new research opportunities.

Reliable Learning of Halfspaces under Gaussian Marginals
We study the problem of PAC learning halfspaces in the reliable agnostic model of Kalai et al. (2012).The reliable PAC model  captures learning scenarios where one type of error is costlier than the others. Our main positive result is a new algorithm for reliable learning of Gaussian halfspaces on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with sample and computational complexity $d^{O(\log (\min\{1/\alpha, 1/\epsilon\}))}\min (2^{\log(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log (1/\alpha))}},2^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)})$, where $\epsilon$ is the excess error and $\alpha$ is the bias of the optimal halfspace. We complement our upper bound with a Statistical Query lower bound suggesting that the $d^{\Omega(\log (1/\alpha))}$ dependence is best possible. Conceptually, our results imply a strong computational separation between reliable agnostic learning and standard agnostic learning of halfspaces in the Gaussian setting.

ReLU Characteristic Activation Analysis
We introduce a novel approach for analyzing the training dynamics of ReLU networks by examining the characteristic activation boundaries of individual ReLU neurons. Our proposed analysis reveals a critical instability in common neural network parameterizations and normalizations during stochastic optimization, which impedes fast convergence and hurts generalization performance. Addressing this, we propose Geometric Parameterization (GmP), a novel neural network parameterization technique that effectively separates the radial and angular components of weights in the hyperspherical coordinate system. We show theoretically that GmP resolves the aforementioned instability issue. We report empirical results on various models and benchmarks to verify GmP's theoretical advantages of optimization stability, convergence speed and generalization performance.

Remix-DiT: Mixing Diffusion Transformers for Multi-Expert Denoising
Transformer-based diffusion models have achieved significant advancements across a variety of generative tasks. However, producing high-quality outputs typically necessitates large transformer models, which result in substantial training and inference overhead. In this work, we investigate an alternative approach involving multiple experts for denoising, and introduce Remix-DiT, a novel method designed to enhance output quality at a low cost. The goal of Remix-DiT is to craft N diffusion experts for different denoising timesteps, yet without the need for expensive training of $N$ independent models. To achieve this, Remix-DiT employs $K$ basis models (where $K < N$) and utilizes learnable mixing coefficients to adaptively craft expert models. This design offers two significant advantages: first, although the total model size is increased, the model produced by the mixing operation shares the same architecture as a plain model, making the overall model as efficient as a standard diffusion transformer. Second, the learnable mixing adaptively allocates model capacity across timesteps, thereby effectively improving generation quality. Experiments conducted on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that Remix-DiT achieves promising results compared to standard diffusion transformers and other multiple-expert methods.

Remove that Square Root: A New Efficient Scale-Invariant Version of AdaGrad
Adaptive methods are extremely popular in machine learning as they make learning rate tuning less expensive. This paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm named KATE, which presents a scale-invariant adaptation of the well-known AdaGrad algorithm. We prove the scale-invariance of KATE for the case of Generalized Linear Models. Moreover, for general smooth non-convex problems, we establish a convergence rate of  $O((\log T)/\sqrt{T})$ for KATE, matching the best-known ones for AdaGrad and Adam. We also compare KATE to other state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms Adam and AdaGrad in numerical experiments with different problems, including complex machine learning tasks like image classification and text classification on real data. The results indicate that KATE consistently outperforms AdaGrad and matches/surpasses the performance of Adam in all considered scenarios.

ReNO: Enhancing One-step Text-to-Image Models through Reward-based Noise Optimization
Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made significant advancements in recent years, but they still struggle to accurately capture intricate details specified in complex compositional prompts. While fine-tuning T2I models with reward objectives has shown promise, it suffers from "reward hacking" and may not generalize well to unseen prompt distributions. In this work, we propose Reward-based Noise Optimization (ReNO), a novel approach that enhances T2I models at inference by optimizing the initial noise based on the signal from one or multiple human preference reward models. Remarkably, solving this optimization problem with gradient ascent for 50 iterations yields impressive results on four different one-step models across two competitive benchmarks, T2I-CompBench and GenEval. Within a computational budget of 20-50 seconds, ReNO-enhanced one-step models consistently surpass the performance of all current open-source Text-to-Image models. Extensive user studies demonstrate that our model is preferred nearly twice as often compared to the popular SDXL model and is on par with the proprietary Stable Diffusion 3 with 8B parameters. Moreover, given the same computational resources, a ReNO-optimized one-step model outperforms widely-used open-source models such as SDXL and PixArt-alpha, highlighting the efficiency and effectiveness of ReNO in enhancing T2I model performance at inference time.

Reparameterizable Tree-structured Variational Inference for Instance-level Correlation Capturing
Mean-field variational inference (VI) is computationally scalable, but its highly-demanding independence requirement hinders it from being applied to wider scenarios. Although many VI methods that take correlation into account have been proposed, these methods generally are not scalable enough to capture the correlation among data instances, which often arises in applications with graph-structured data or explicit constraints. In this paper, we developed the Tree-structured Variational Inference (TreeVI), which uses a tree structure to capture the correlation of latent variables in the posterior distribution. We show that  samples from the tree-structured posterior can be reparameterized efficiently and parallelly, making its training cost just 2 or 3 times that of VI under the mean-field assumption. To capture correlation with more complicated structure, the TreeVI is further extended to the multiple-tree case. Furthermore, we show that the underlying tree structure can be automatically learned from training data. With experiments on synthetic datasets, constrained clustering, user matching and link prediction, we demonstrate that the TreeVI is superior in capturing  instance-level correlation in posteriors and enhancing the performance of downstream applications.

Reparameterization invariance in approximate Bayesian inference
Current approximate posteriors in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) exhibit a crucial limitation: they fail to maintain invariance under reparameterization, i.e. BNNs assign different posterior densities to different parametrizations of identical functions. This creates a fundamental flaw in the application of Bayesian principles as it breaks the correspondence between uncertainty over the parameters with uncertainty over the parametrized function. In this paper, we investigate this issue in the context of the increasingly popular linearized Laplace approximation. Specifically, it has been observed that linearized predictives alleviate the common underfitting problems of the Laplace approximation. We develop a new geometric view of reparametrizations from which we explain the success of linearization. Moreover, we demonstrate that these reparameterization invariance properties can be extended to the original neural network predictive using a Riemannian diffusion process giving a straightforward algorithm for approximate posterior sampling, which empirically improves posterior fit.

Reparameterized Multi-Resolution Convolutions for Long Sequence Modelling
Global convolutions have shown increasing promise as powerful general-purpose sequence models. However, training long convolutions is challenging, and kernel parameterizations must be able to learn long-range dependencies without overfitting. This work introduces reparameterized multi-resolution convolutions ($\texttt{MRConv}$), a novel approach to parameterizing global convolutional kernels for long-sequence modeling. By leveraging multi-resolution convolutions, incorporating structural reparameterization and introducing learnable kernel decay, $\texttt{MRConv}$ learns expressive long-range kernels that perform well across various data modalities. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the Long Range Arena, Sequential CIFAR, and Speech Commands tasks among convolution models and linear-time transformers. Moreover, we report improved performance on ImageNet classification by replacing 2D convolutions with 1D $\texttt{MRConv}$ layers.

Replay-and-Forget-Free Graph Class-Incremental Learning: A Task Profiling and Prompting Approach
Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to continually learn a sequence of tasks, with each task consisting of a set of unique classes. Graph CIL (GCIL) follows the same setting but needs to deal with graph tasks (e.g., node classification in a graph). The key characteristic of CIL lies in the absence of task identifiers (IDs) during inference, which causes a significant challenge in separating classes from different tasks (i.e., inter-task class separation). Being able to accurately predict the task IDs can help address this issue, but it is a challenging problem. In this paper, we show theoretically that accurate task ID prediction on graph data can be achieved by a Laplacian smoothing-based graph task profiling approach, in which each graph task is modeled by a task prototype based on Laplacian smoothing over the graph. It guarantees that the task prototypes of the same graph task are nearly the same with a large smoothing step, while those of different tasks are distinct due to differences in graph structure and node attributes. Further, to avoid the catastrophic forgetting of the knowledge learned in previous graph tasks, we propose a novel graph prompting approach for GCIL which learns a small discriminative graph prompt for each task, essentially resulting in a separate classification model for each task. The prompt learning requires the training of a single graph neural network (GNN) only once on the first task, and no data replay is required thereafter, thereby obtaining a GCIL model being both replay-free and forget-free. Extensive experiments on four GCIL benchmarks show that i) our task prototype-based method can achieve 100% task ID prediction accuracy on all four datasets, ii) our GCIL model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 18% in average CIL accuracy, and iii) our model is fully free of forgetting on the four datasets.

Replicability in Learning: Geometric Partitions and KKM-Sperner Lemma
This paper studies replicability in machine learning tasks from a geometric viewpoint. Recent works have revealed the role of geometric partitions and  Sperner's lemma (and its variations) in designing replicable learning algorithms and in establishing impossibility results.  A partition $\mathcal{P}$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ is called a $(k,\epsilon)$-secluded partition if for every $\vec{p}\in\mathbb{R}^d$, an $\varepsilon$-radius ball (with respect to the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm) centered at $\vec{p}$ intersects at most $k$ members of $\mathcal{P}$.  In relation to replicable learning, the parameter $k$ is closely related to the {\em list complexity}, and the parameter $\varepsilon$ is related to the sample complexity of the replicable learner. Construction of secluded partitions with better parameters (small $k$ and large $\varepsilon$) will lead to replicable learning algorithms with small list and sample complexities. Motivated by this connection, we undertake a comprehensive study of secluded partitions and establish near-optimal relationships between $k$ and $\varepsilon$. 1.  We show that for any $(k,\epsilon)$-secluded partition where each member has at most unit measure, it must be that $k \geq(1+2\varepsilon)^d$, and consequently, for the interesting regime $k\in[2^d]$ it must be that $\epsilon\leq\frac{\log_4(k)}{d}$. 2. To complement this upper bound on $\epsilon$, we show that for each $d\in\mathbb{N}$ and each viable $k\in[2^d]$, a construction of a $(k,\epsilon)$-secluded (unit cube) partition with $\epsilon\geq\frac{\log_4(k)}{d}\cdot\frac{1}{8\log_4(d+1)}$. This establishes the optimality of $\epsilon$ within a logarithmic factor.3.  Finally, we adapt our proof techniques to obtain a new ``neighborhood'' variant of the cubical KKM lemma (or cubical Sperner's lemma): For any coloring of $[0,1]^d$ in which no color is used on opposing faces, it holds for each $\epsilon\in(0,\frac12]$ that there is a point where the open $\epsilon$-radius $\ell_\infty$-ball intersects at least $(1+\frac23\epsilon)^d$ colors. While the classical Sperner/KKM lemma guarantees the existence of a point that is "adjacent" to points with $(d+1)$ distinct colors, the neighborhood version guarantees the existence of a small neighborhood with  exponentially many points with distinct colors.

Replicable Uniformity Testing
Uniformity testing is arguably one of the most fundamental distribution testing problems. Given sample access to an unknown distribution $\mathbf p$ on $[n]$, one must decide if $\mathbf p$ is uniform or $\varepsilon$-far from uniform (in total variation distance). A long line of work established that uniformity testing has sample complexity $\Theta(\sqrt{n}\varepsilon^{-2})$. However, when the input distribution is neither uniform nor far from uniform, known algorithms may have highly non-replicable behavior. Consequently, if these algorithms are applied in scientific studies, they may lead to contradictory results that erode public trust in science.In this work, we revisit uniformity testing under the framework of algorithmic replicability [STOC '22], requiring the algorithm to be replicable under arbitrary distributions. While replicability typically incurs a $\rho^{-2}$ factor overhead in sample complexity, we obtain a replicable uniformity tester using only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} \varepsilon^{-2} \rho^{-1})$ samples. To our knowledge, this is the first replicable learning algorithm with (nearly) linear dependence on $\rho$.Lastly, we consider a class of ``symmetric" algorithms [FOCS '00] whose outputs are invariant under relabeling of the domain $[n]$, which includes all existing uniformity testers (including ours). For this natural class of algorithms, we prove a nearly matching sample complexity lower bound for replicable uniformity testing.

Reproducibility of predictive networks for mouse visual cortex
Deep predictive models of neuronal activity have recently enabled several new discoveries about the selectivity and invariance of neurons in the visual cortex.These models learn a shared set of nonlinear basis functions, which are linearly combined via a learned weight vector to represent a neuron's function.Such weight vectors, which can be thought as embeddings of neuronal function, have been proposed to define functional cell types via unsupervised clustering.However, as deep models are usually highly overparameterized, the learning problem is unlikely to have a unique solution, which raises the question if such embeddings can be used in a meaningful way for downstream analysis.In this paper, we investigate how stable neuronal embeddings are with respect to changes in model architecture and initialization. We find that $L_1$ regularization to be an important ingredient for structured embeddings and develop an adaptive regularization that adjusts the strength of regularization per neuron.  This regularization improves both predictive performance and how consistently neuronal embeddings cluster across model fits  compared to uniform regularization.To overcome overparametrization, we propose an iterative feature pruning strategy which reduces the dimensionality of performance-optimized models by half without loss of performance and improves the consistency of neuronal embeddings with respect to clustering neurons.This result suggests that to achieve an objective taxonomy of cell types or a compact representation of the functional landscape, we need novel architectures or learning techniques that improve identifiability. We will make our code available at publication time.

Repurposing Language Models into Embedding Models: Finding the Compute-Optimal Recipe
Text embeddings are essential for tasks such as document retrieval, clustering, and semantic similarity assessment. In this paper, we study how to contrastively train text embedding models in a compute-optimal fashion, given a suite of pretrained decoder-only language models. Our innovation is an algorithm that produces optimal configurations of model sizes, data quantities, and fine-tuning methods for text-embedding models at different computational budget levels. The resulting recipe, which we obtain through extensive experiments, can be used by practitioners to make informed design choices for their embedding models. Specifically, our findings suggest that full fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning produce optimal models at lower and higher computational budgets respectively.

Resfusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Restoration Based on Prior Residual Noise
Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model will be available.

Reshuffling Resampling Splits Can Improve Generalization of Hyperparameter Optimization
Hyperparameter optimization is crucial for obtaining peak performance of machine learning models.The standard protocol evaluates various hyperparameter configurations using a resampling estimate of the generalization error to guide optimization and select a final hyperparameter configuration.Without much evidence, paired resampling splits, i.e., either a fixed train-validation split or a fixed cross-validation scheme, are often recommended. We show that, surprisingly, reshuffling the splits for every configuration often improves the final model's generalization performance on unseen data. Our theoretical analysis explains how reshuffling affects the asymptotic behavior of the validation loss surface and provides a bound on the expected regret in the limiting regime. This bound connects the potential benefits of reshuffling to the signal and noise characteristics of the underlying optimization problem. We confirm our theoretical results in a controlled simulation study and demonstrate the practical usefulness of reshuffling in a large-scale, realistic hyperparameter optimization experiment. While reshuffling leads to test performances that are competitive with using fixed splits, it drastically improves results for a single train-validation holdout protocol and can often make holdout become competitive with standard CV while being computationally cheaper.

Resource-Aware Federated Self-Supervised Learning with Global Class Representations
Due to the heterogeneous architectures and class skew, the global representation models training in resource-adaptive federated self-supervised learning face with tricky challenges: $\textit{deviated representation abilities}$ and $\textit{inconsistent representation spaces}$. In this work, we are the first to propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework, namely $\textit{FedMKD}$, to learn global representations with whole class knowledge from heterogeneous clients even under extreme class skew. Firstly, the adaptive knowledge integration mechanism is designed to learn better representations from all heterogeneous models with deviated representation abilities. Then the weighted combination of the self-supervised loss and the distillation loss can support the global model to encode all classes from clients into a unified space. Besides, the global knowledge anchored alignment module can make the local representation spaces close to the global spaces, which further improves the representation abilities of local ones. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{FedMKD}$ which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines 4.78\% under linear evaluation on average.

Rethinking Decoders for Transformer-based Semantic Segmentation: Compression is All You Need
State-of-the-art Transformer-based methods for semantic segmentation are based on variant specially designed decoders, which typically consist of learnable class embeddings, self- or cross-attention layers, and dot-product operation. However, these very designs still lack theoretical explanations, thus hindering the potentially principled improvements. In this paper, we attempt to derive their white-box counterparts from the perspective of compression. Consequently, we find that: 1) semantic segmentation can be viewed as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where principal directions are classifiers and 2) self-attention minimizes the reconstruction error for better compression and cross-attention solves the principal directions for classification. Our derivation for the white-box decoders can not only unlock the mechanism behind the black-box decoders in Transformer-based methods for semantic segmentation but also the derived DEcoders via solving PrIncipal direCTions (DEPICT) achieve comparable performance to their black-box counterparts. In particular, when using ViT-B as the encoder, DEPICT outperforms the mask transformer on dataset ADE20K with merely 1/8 of the parameters, which validates the effectiveness of our derivation.

Rethinking Deep Thinking
Iterative algorithms solve problems by taking steps until a solution is reached. Models in the form of Deep Thinking (DT) networks have been demonstrated to learn iterative algorithms in a way that can scale to different sized problems at inference time using recurrent computation and convolutions. However, they are often unstable during training, and have no guarantees of convergence/termination at the solution. This paper addresses the problem of instability by analyzing the growth in intermediate representations, allowing us to build models (referred to as Deep Thinking with Lipschitz Constraints (DT-L)) with many fewer parameters and providing more reliable solutions. Additionally our DT-L formulation provides guarantees of convergence of the learned iterative procedure to a unique solution at inference time. We demonstrate DT-L is capable of robustly learning algorithms which extrapolate to harder problems than in the training set. We benchmark on the traveling salesperson problem to evaluate the capabilities of the modified system in an NP-hard problem where DT fails to learn.

Rethinking Imbalance in Image Super-Resolution for Efficient Inference
Existing super-resolution (SR) methods optimize all model weights equally using $\mathcal{L}_1$ or $\mathcal{L}_2$ losses by uniformly sampling image patches without considering dataset imbalances or parameter redundancy, which limits their performance. To address this, we formulate the image SR task as an imbalanced distribution transfer learning problem from a statistical probability perspective, proposing a plug-and-play Weight-Balancing framework (WBSR) to achieve balanced model learning without changing the original model structure and training data. Specifically, we develop a Hierarchical Equalization Sampling (HES) strategy to address data distribution imbalances, enabling better feature representation from texture-rich samples. To tackle model optimization imbalances, we propose a Balanced Diversity Loss (BDLoss) function, focusing on learning texture regions while disregarding redundant computations in smooth regions. After joint training of HES and BDLoss to rectify these imbalances, we present a gradient projection dynamic inference strategy to facilitate accurate and efficient inference. Extensive experiments across various models, datasets, and scale factors demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to existing approaches with about 34\% reduction in computational cost.

Rethinking Score Distillation as a Bridge Between Image Distributions
Score distillation sampling (SDS) has proven to be an important tool, enabling the use of large-scale diffusion priors for tasks operating in data-poor domains. Unfortunately, SDS has a number of characteristic artifacts that limit its utility in general-purpose applications. In this paper, we make progress toward understanding the behavior of SDS and its variants by viewing them as solving an optimal-cost transport path from some current source distribution to a target distribution. Under this new interpretation, we argue that these methods' characteristic artifacts are caused by (1) linear approximation of the optimal path and (2) poor estimates of the source distribution.We show that by calibrating the text conditioning of the source distribution, we can produce high-quality generation and translation results with little extra overhead. Our method can be easily applied across many domains, matching or beating the performance of specialized methods. We demonstrate its utility in text-to-2D, text-to-3D, translating paintings to real images, optical illusion generation, and 3D sketch-to-real. We compare our method to existing approaches for score distillation sampling and show that it can produce high-frequency details with realistic colors.

Rethinking the Capacity of Graph Neural Networks for Branching Strategy
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to predict properties and heuristics of mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) and hence accelerate MILP solvers. This paper investigates the capacity of GNNs to represent strong branching (SB), the most effective yet computationally expensive heuristic employed in the branch-and-bound algorithm. In the literature, message-passing GNN (MP-GNN), as the simplest GNN structure, is frequently used as a fast approximation of SB and we find that not all MILPs's SB can be represented with MP-GNN. We precisely define a class of ``MP-tractable" MILPs for which MP-GNNs can accurately approximate SB scores. Particularly, we establish a universal approximation theorem: for any data distribution over the MP-tractable class, there always exists an MP-GNN that can approximate the SB score with arbitrarily high accuracy and arbitrarily high probability, which lays a theoretical foundation of the existing works on imitating SB with MP-GNN. For MILPs without the MP-tractability, unfortunately, a similar result is impossible, which can be illustrated by two MILP instances with different SB scores that cannot be distinguished by any MP-GNN, regardless of the number of parameters. Recognizing this, we explore another GNN structure called the second-order folklore GNN (2-FGNN) that overcomes this limitation, and the aforementioned universal approximation theorem can be extended to the entire MILP space using 2-FGNN, regardless of the MP-tractability. A small-scale numerical experiment is conducted to directly validate our theoretical findings.

Rethinking Transformer for Long Contextual Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis
Histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis serves as the gold standard for clinical cancer diagnosis in the daily routines of doctors. To develop computer-aided diagnosis model for histopathology WSIs, previous methods typically employ Multi-Instance Learning to enable slide-level prediction given only slide-level labels.Among these models, vanilla attention mechanisms without pairwise interactions have traditionally been employed but are unable to model contextual information. More recently, self-attention models have been utilized to address this issue. To alleviate the computational complexity of long sequences in large WSIs, methods like HIPT use region-slicing, and TransMIL employs Nystr\"{o}mformer as an approximation of full self-attention. Both approaches suffer from suboptimal performance due to the loss of key information. Moreover, their use of absolute positional embedding struggles to effectively handle long contextual dependencies in shape-varying WSIs.In this paper, we first analyze how the low-rank nature of the long-sequence attention matrix constrains the representation ability of WSI modelling. Then, we demonstrate that the rank of attention matrix can be improved by focusing on local interactions via a local attention mask. Our analysis shows that the local mask aligns with the attention patterns in the lower layers of the Transformer. Furthermore, the local attention mask can be implemented during chunked attention calculation, reducing the quadratic computational complexity to linear with a small local bandwidth. Additionally, this locality helps the model generalize to unseen or under-fitted positions more easily.Building on this, we propose a local-global hybrid Transformer for both computational acceleration and local-global information interactions modelling. Our method, Long-contextual MIL (LongMIL), is evaluated through extensive experiments on various WSI tasks to validate its superiority in: 1) overall performance, 2) memory usage and speed, and 3) extrapolation ability compared to previous methods.

Rethinking Weight Decay for Robust Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models
Modern optimizers such as AdamW, equipped with momentum and adaptive learning rate, are designed to escape local minima and explore the vast parameter space. This exploration is beneficial for finding good loss basins when training from scratch. It is not necessarily ideal when resuming from a powerful foundation model because it can lead to large deviations from the pre-trained initialization and, consequently, worse robustness and generalization. At the same time, strong regularization on all parameters can lead to under-fitting. We hypothesize that selectively regularizing the parameter space is the key to fitting and retraining the pre-trained knowledge. This paper proposes a new weight decay technique, Selective Projection Decay (SPD), that selectively imposes a strong penalty on certain layers while allowing others to change freely. Intuitively, SPD expands and contracts the parameter search space for layers with consistent and inconsistent loss reduction, respectively. Experimentally, when equipped with SPD, Adam consistently provides better in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution robustness performance on multiple popular vision and language benchmarks.

Retrieval & Fine-Tuning for In-Context Tabular Models
Tabular data is a pervasive modality spanning a wide range of domains, and the inherent diversity poses a considerable challenge for deep learning. Recent advancements using transformer-based in-context learning have shown promise on smaller and less complex datasets, but have struggled to scale to larger and more complex ones. To address this limitation, we propose a combination of retrieval and fine-tuning: we can adapt the transformer to a local subset of the data by collecting nearest neighbours, and then perform task-specific fine-tuning with this retrieved set of neighbours in context. Using TabPFN as the base model -- currently the best tabular in-context learner -- and applying our retrieval and fine-tuning scheme on top results in what we call a locally-calibrated PFN, or LoCalPFN. We conduct extensive evaluation on 95 datasets curated by TabZilla from OpenML, upon which we establish a new state-of-the-art with LoCalPFN -- even with respect to tuned tree-based models. Notably, we show a significant boost in performance compared to the base in-context model, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach  and advancing the frontier of deep learning in tabular data.

RETR: Multi-View Radar Detection Transformer for Indoor Perception
Indoor radar perception has seen rising interest due to affordable costs driven by emerging automotive imaging radar developments and the benefits of reduced privacy concerns and reliability under hazardous conditions (e.g., fire and smoke). However, existing radar perception pipelines fail to account for distinctive characteristics of the multi-view radar setting. In this paper, we propose Radar dEtection TRansformer (RETR), an extension of the popular DETR architecture, tailored for multi-view radar perception. RETR inherits the advantages of DETR, eliminating the need for hand-crafted components for object detection and segmentation in the image plane. More importantly, RETR incorporates carefully designed modifications such as 1) depth-prioritized feature similarity via a tunable positional embedding (TPE); 2) a tri-plane loss from both radar and camera coordinates; and 3) a learnable radar-to-camera transformation via reparameterization, to account for the unique multi-view radar setting. Evaluated on two indoor radar perception datasets, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 15.28+ AP for object detection and 11.72+ IoU for instance segmentation, respectively.

Return of Unconditional Generation: A Self-supervised Representation Generation Method
Unconditional generation -- the problem of modeling data distribution without relying on human-annotated labels -- is a long-standing and fundamental challenge in generative models, creating a potential of learning from large-scale unlabeled data. In the literature, the generation quality of an unconditional method has been much worse than that of its conditional counterpart. This gap can be attributed to the lack of semantic information provided by labels. In this work, we show that one can close this gap by generating semantic representations in the representation space produced by a self-supervised encoder. These representations can be used to condition the image generator. This framework, called Representation-Conditioned Generation (RCG), provides an effective solution to the unconditional generation problem without using labels. Through comprehensive experiments, we observe that RCG significantly improves unconditional generation quality: e.g., it achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 2.15 on ImageNet 256x256, largely reducing the previous best of 5.91 by a relative 64%. Our unconditional results are situated in the same tier as the leading class-conditional ones. We hope these encouraging observations will attract the community's attention to the fundamental problem of unconditional generation.

Revealing Distribution Discrepancy by Sampling Transfer in Unlabeled Data
There are increasing cases where the class labels of test samples are unavailable, creating a significant need and challenge in measuring the discrepancy between training and test distributions. This distribution discrepancy complicates the assessment of whether the hypothesis selected by an algorithm on training samples remains applicable to test samples. We present a novel approach called Importance Divergence (I-Div) to address the challenge of test label unavailability, enabling distribution discrepancy evaluation using only training samples. I-Div transfers the sampling patterns from the test distribution to the training distribution by estimating density and likelihood ratios. Specifically, the density ratio, informed by the selected hypothesis, is obtained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the actual and estimated input distributions. Simultaneously, the likelihood ratio is adjusted according to the density ratio by reducing the generalization error of the distribution discrepancy as transformed through the two ratios. Experimentally, I-Div accurately quantifies the distribution discrepancy, as evidenced by a wide range of complex data scenarios and tasks.

Reverse Transition Kernel: A Flexible Framework to Accelerate Diffusion Inference
To generate data from trained diffusion models, most inference algorithms, such as DDPM, DDIM, and other variants, rely on discretizing the reverse SDEs or their equivalent ODEs. In this paper, we view such approaches as decomposing the entire denoising diffusion process into several segments, each corresponding to a reverse transition kernel (RTK) sampling subproblem. Specifically, DDPM uses a Gaussian approximation for the RTK, resulting in low per-subproblem complexity but requiring a large number of segments (i.e., subproblems), which is conjectured to be inefficient. To address this, we develop a general RTK framework that enables a more balanced subproblem decomposition, resulting in $\tilde O(1)$ subproblems, each with strongly log-concave targets. We then propose leveraging two fast sampling algorithms, the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) and Underdamped Langevin Dynamics (ULD), for solving these strongly log-concave subproblems. This gives rise to the RTK-MALA and RTK-ULD algorithms for diffusion inference. In theory, we further develop the convergence guarantees for  RTK-MALA and RTK-ULD in total variation (TV) distance: RTK-ULD can achieve $\epsilon$ target error within $\tilde{\mathcal O}(d^{1/2}\epsilon^{-1})$ under mild conditions, and  RTK-MALA enjoys a $\mathcal{O}(d^{2}\log(d/\epsilon))$   convergence rate under slightly stricter conditions. These theoretical results surpass the state-of-the-art convergence rates for diffusion inference and are well supported by numerical experiments.

ReVideo: Remake a Video with Motion and Content Control
Despite significant advancements in video generation and editing using diffusion models, achieving accurate and localized video editing remains a substantial challenge. Additionally, most existing video editing methods primarily focus on altering visual content, with limited research dedicated to motion editing. In this paper, we present a novel attempt to Remake a Video (ReVideo) which stands out from existing methods by allowing precise video editing in specific areas through the specification of both content and motion. Content editing is facilitated by modifying the first frame, while the trajectory-based motion control offers an intuitive user interaction experience. ReVideo addresses a new task involving the coupling and training imbalance between content and motion control. To tackle this, we develop a three-stage training strategy that progressively decouples these two aspects from coarse to fine. Furthermore, we propose a spatiotemporal adaptive fusion module to integrate content and motion control across various sampling steps and spatial locations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReVideo has promising performance on several accurate video editing applications, i.e., (1) locally changing video content while keeping the motion constant, (2) keeping content unchanged and customizing new motion trajectories, (3) modifying both content and motion trajectories. Our method can also seamlessly extend these applications to multi-area editing without specific training, demonstrating its flexibility and robustness.

Revisiting, Benchmarking and Understanding Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation
Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) involves the transfer of knowledge from a label-rich source graph to an unlabeled target graph under domain discrepancies. Despite the proliferation of methods designed for this emerging task, the lack of standard experimental settings and fair performance comparisons makes it challenging to understand which and when models perform well across different scenarios. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for unsupervised graph domain adaptation named GDABench, which encompasses 16 algorithms across 5 datasets with 74 adaptation tasks. Through extensive experiments, we observe that the performance of current UGDA models varies significantly across different datasets and adaptation scenarios. Specifically, we recognize that when the source and target graphs face significant distribution shifts, it is imperative to formulate strategies to effectively address and mitigate graph structural shifts. We also find that with appropriate neighbourhood aggregation mechanisms, simple GNN variants can even surpass state-of-the-art UGDA baselines. To facilitate reproducibility, we have developed an easy-to-use library PyGDA for training and evaluating existing UGDA methods, providing a standardized platform in this community. Our source codes and datasets can be found at https://github.com/pygda-team/pygda.

Revisiting motion information for RGB-Event tracking with MOT philosophy
RGB-Event (RGB-E) tracking aims to leverage the merits of RGB and event data to achieve higher performance. However, existing frameworks focus on exploring complementary appearance information within multi-modal data, and struggle to address the association problem of targets and distractors in the temporal domain using motion information from the event stream. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to keep track of targets as well as distractors by using both RGB and Event data in conjunction with a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) philosophy, thereby improving the robustness of the tracker. Specifically, an appearance model is employed to predict the initial candidates. Subsequently, the initially predicted tracking results, in combination with the RGB-E features, are encoded into appearance and motion embeddings, respectively. Furthermore, a Spatial-Temporal Transformer Encoder is proposed to model the spatial-temporal relationships and learn discriminative features for each candidate through guidance of the appearance-motion embeddings. Simultaneously, a Dual-Branch Transformer Decoder is designed to adopt such motion and appearance information for candidate matching, thus distinguishing between targets and distractors. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets tested.

Revisiting Self-Supervised Heterogeneous Graph Learning from Spectral Clustering Perspective
Self-supervised heterogeneous graph learning (SHGL) has shown promising potential in diverse scenarios. However,  while existing SHGL methods share a similar essential with clustering approaches, they encounter two significant limitations: (i) noise in graph structures is often introduced during the message-passing process to weaken node representations, and (ii) cluster-level information may be inadequately captured and leveraged, diminishing the performance in downstream tasks. In this paper, we address these limitations by theoretically revisiting SHGL from the spectral clustering perspective and introducing a novel framework enhanced by rank and dual consistency constraints. Specifically, our framework incorporates a rank-constrained spectral clustering method that refines the affinity matrix to exclude noise effectively. Additionally, we integrate node-level and cluster-level consistency constraints that concurrently capture invariant and clustering information to facilitate learning in downstream tasks. We theoretically demonstrate that the learned representations are divided into distinct partitions based on the number of classes and exhibit enhanced generalization ability across tasks. Experimental results affirm the superiority of our method, showcasing remarkable improvements in several downstream tasks compared to existing methods.

Revive Re-weighting in Imbalanced Learning by Density Ratio Estimation
In deep learning contexts, model performance often degrades significantly when trained on heavily imbalanced datasets, particularly when the evaluation metrics necessitate robust generalization across infrequently represented classes. In addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced data distributions in machine learning, this study introduces a novel approach that employs the method of density ratio estimation for dynamic class weight adjustment during model training, an innovative method we refer to as Re-weighting with Density Ratio (RDR). Our approach enables real-time adjustment of the importance of each class during the training process, mitigating overfitting on majority classes and enhancing adaptability across diverse datasets. Extensive experiments conducted on various large scale benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach. Results demonstrate substantial improvements in generalization capabilities, particularly under severely imbalanced condition.

RFLPA: A Robust Federated Learning Framework against Poisoning Attacks with Secure Aggregation
Federated learning (FL) allows multiple devices to train a model collaboratively without sharing their data. Despite its benefits, FL is vulnerable to privacy leakage and poisoning attacks. To address the privacy concern, secure aggregation (SecAgg) is often used to obtain the aggregation of gradients on sever without inspecting individual user updates. Unfortunately, existing defense strategies against poisoning attacks rely on the analysis of local updates in plaintext, making them incompatible with SecAgg. To reconcile the conflicts, we propose a robust federated learning framework against poisoning attacks (RFLPA) based on SecAgg protocol. Our framework computes the cosine similarity between local updates and server updates to conduct robust aggregation. Furthermore, we leverage verifiable packed Shamir secret sharing to achieve reduced communication cost of $O(M+N)$ per user, and design a novel dot-product aggregation algorithm to resolve the issue of increased information leakage. Our experimental results show that RFLPA significantly reduces communication and computation overhead by over $75\%$ compared to the state-of-the-art method, BREA, while maintaining competitive accuracy.

RLE: A Unified Perspective of Data Augmentation for Cross-Spectral Re-Identification
This paper makes a step towards modeling the modality discrepancy in the cross-spectral re-identification task. Based on the Lambertain model, we observe that the non-linear modality discrepancy mainly comes from diverse linear transformations acting on the surface of different materials. From this view, we unify all data augmentation strategies for cross-spectral re-identification as mimicking such local linear transformations and categorize them into moderate transformation and radical transformation. By extending the observation, we propose a Random Linear Enhancement (RLE) strategy which includes Moderate Random Linear Enhancement (MRLE)  and Radical Random Linear Enhancement (RRLE)  to push the boundaries of both types of transformation. Moderate Random Linear Enhancement is designed to provide diverse image transformations that satisfy the original linear correlations under constrained conditions, whereas Radical Random Linear Enhancement seeks to generate local linear transformations directly without relying on external information. The experimental results not only demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of RLE but also confirm its great potential as a general-purpose data augmentation for cross-spectral re-identification.

RMLR: Extending Multinomial Logistic Regression into General Geometries
Riemannian neural networks, which extend deep learning techniques to Riemannian spaces, have gained significant attention in machine learning. To better classify the manifold-valued features, researchers have started extending Euclidean multinomial logistic regression (MLR) into Riemannian manifolds. However, existing approaches suffer from limited applicability due to their strong reliance on specific geometric properties. This paper proposes a framework for designing Riemannian MLR over general geometries, referred to as RMLR. Our framework only requires minimal geometric properties, thus exhibiting broad applicability and enabling its use with a wide range of geometries. Specifically, we showcase our framework on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold and special orthogonal group, i.e., the set of rotation matrices. On the SPD manifold, we develop five families of SPD MLRs under five types of power-deformed metrics. On rotation matrices we propose Lie MLR based on the popular bi-invariant metric. Extensive experiments on different Riemannian backbone networks validate the effectiveness of our framework.

Road Network Representation Learning with the Third Law of Geography
Road network representation learning aims to learn compressed and effective vectorized representations for road segments that are applicable to numerous tasks. In this paper, we identify the limitations of existing methods, particularly their overemphasis on the distance effect as outlined in the First Law of Geography. In response,  we propose to endow road network representation with the principles of the recent Third Law of Geography. To this end, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning framework that employs geographic configuration-aware graph augmentation and spectral negative sampling, ensuring that road segments with similar geographic configurations yield similar representations, and vice versa, aligning with the principles stated in the Third Law. The framework further fuses the Third Law with the First Law through a dual contrastive learning objective to effectively balance the implications of both laws. We evaluate our framework on two real-world datasets across three downstream tasks. The results show that the integration of the Third Law significantly improves the performance of road segment representations in downstream tasks.

ROBIN: Robust and Invisible Watermarks for Diffusion Models with Adversarial Optimization
Watermarking generative content serves as a vital tool for authentication, ownership protection, and mitigation of potential misuse. Existing watermarking methods face the challenge of balancing robustness and concealment. They empirically inject a watermark that is both invisible and robust and passively achieve concealment by limiting the strength of the watermark, thus reducing the robustness. In this paper, we propose to explicitly introduce a watermark hiding process to actively achieve concealment, thus allowing the embedding of stronger watermarks. To be specific, we implant a robust watermark in an intermediate diffusion state and then guide the model to hide the watermark in the final generated image. We employ an adversarial optimization algorithm to produce the optimal hiding prompt guiding signal for each watermark. The prompt is optimized to minimize artifacts in the generated image, while the watermark is optimized to achieve maximum strength. The watermark can be verified by reversing the generation process. Experiments on various diffusion models demonstrate the watermark remains verifiable even under significant image tampering and shows superior invisibility compared to other state-of-the-art robust watermarking methods.

RobIR: Robust Inverse Rendering for High-Illumination Scenes
Implicit representation has opened up new possibilities for inverse rendering. However, existing implicit neural inverse rendering methods struggle to handle strongly illuminated scenes with significant shadows and slight reflections. The existence of shadows and reflections can lead to an inaccurate understanding of the scene, making precise factorization difficult. To this end, we present RobIR, an implicit inverse rendering approach that uses ACES tone mapping and regularized visibility estimation to reconstruct accurate BRDF of the object. By accurately modeling the indirect radiance field, normal, visibility, and direct light simultaneously, we are able to accurately decouple environment lighting and the object's PBR materials without imposing strict constraints on the scene. Even in high-illumination scenes with shadows and specular reflections, our method can recover high-quality albedo and roughness with no shadow interference. RobIR outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Robust and Faster Zeroth-order Minimax Optimization: Complexity and Applications
Many zeroth-order (ZO) optimization algorithms have been developed to solve nonconvex minimax problems in machine learning and computer vision areas. However, existing ZO minimax algorithms have high complexity and rely on some strict restrictive conditions for ZO gradient estimations. To address these issues, we design a new unified ZO gradient descent extragradient ascent (ZO-GDEGA) algorithm, which reduces the overall complexity to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$ to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the function $\psi$ for nonconvex-concave (NC-C) problems. To the best of our knowledge, ZO-GDEGA is the first ZO algorithm with complexity guarantees to solve stochastic NC-C problems. Moreover, ZO-GDEGA requires weaker conditions on the ZO gradient estimations and achieves more robust theoretical results. As a by-product, ZO-GDEGA also has advantages on the condition number for the NC-strongly concave case. Experimentally, ZO-GDEGA can generate more effective poisoning attack data with an average accuracy reduction of 5\%. The improved AUC performance also verifies the robustness of gradient estimations.

Robust Conformal Prediction Using Privileged Information
We develop a method to generate prediction sets with a guaranteed coverage rate that is robust to corruptions in the training data, such as missing or noisy variables. Our approach builds on conformal prediction, a powerful framework to construct prediction sets that are valid under the i.i.d assumption. Importantly, naively applying conformal prediction does not provide reliable predictions in this setting, due to the distribution shift induced by the corruptions. To account for the distribution shift, we assume access to privileged information (PI). The PI is formulated as additional features that explain the distribution shift, however, they are only available during training and absent at test time.We approach this problem by introducing a novel generalization of weighted conformal prediction and support our method with theoretical coverage guarantees. Empirical experiments on both real and synthetic datasets indicate that our approach achieves a valid coverage rate and constructs more informative predictions compared to existing methods, which are not supported by theoretical guarantees.

Robust Contrastive Multi-view Clustering against Dual Noisy Correspondence
Recently, contrastive multi-view clustering (MvC) has emerged as a promising avenue for analyzing data from heterogeneous sources, typically leveraging the off-the-shelf instances as positives and randomly sampled ones as negatives. In practice, however, this paradigm would unavoidably suffer from the Dual Noisy Correspondence (DNC) problem, where noise compromises the constructions of both positive and negative pairs.Specifically, the complexity of data collection and transmission might mistake some unassociated pairs as positive (namely, false positive correspondence), while the intrinsic one-to-many contrast nature of contrastive MvC would sample some intra-cluster samples as negative (namely, false negative correspondence).To handle this daunting problem, we propose a novel method, dubbed Contextually-spectral based correspondence refinery (CANDY). CANDY dexterously exploits inter-view similarities as \textit{context} to uncover false negatives. Furthermore, it employs a spectral-based module to denoise correspondence, alleviating the negative influence of false positives. Extensive experiments on five widely-used multi-view benchmarks, in comparison with eight competitive multi-view clustering methods, verify the effectiveness of our method in addressing the DNC problem.The code will be released upon acceptance.

Robust Fine-tuning of Zero-shot Models via Variance Reduction
When fine-tuning zero-shot models like CLIP, our desideratum is for the fine-tuned model to excel in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD). Recently, ensemble-based models (ESM) have been shown to offer significant robustness improvement, while preserving high ID accuracy. However, our study finds that ESMs do not solve the ID-OOD trade-offs: they achieve peak performance for ID and OOD accuracy at different mixing coefficients. When optimized for OOD accuracy, the ensemble model exhibits a noticeable decline in ID accuracy, and vice versa. In contrast, we propose a sample-wise ensembling technique that can simultaneously attain the best ID and OOD accuracy without the trade-offs. Specifically, we construct a Zero-Shot Failure (ZSF) set containing training samples incorrectly predicted by the zero-shot model. For each test sample, we calculate its distance to the ZSF set and assign a higher weight to the fine-tuned model in the ensemble if the distance is small. We term our method Variance Reduction Fine-tuning (VRF), as it effectively reduces the variance in ensemble predictions, thereby decreasing residual error. On ImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, our VRF further improves the OOD accuracy by 1.5 - 2.0 pp over the ensemble baselines while maintaining or increasing ID accuracy. VRF achieves similar large robustness gains on (0.9 - 3.1 pp) on other distribution shifts19 benchmarks. Codes are available in the Appendix.

Robust Gaussian Processes via Relevance Pursuit
Gaussian Processes (GPs) are non-parametric probabilistic regression models that are popular due to their flexibility, data efficiency, and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, in their standard form, GPs assume a homoskedastic Gaussian noise model, while many real-world applications are subject to non-Gaussian noise. Examples include random failures in experiments or heavy-tailed noise in stochastic experiments common to machine learning, perception science, and financial applications. Variants of GPs that are more robust to alternative noise models have been proposed, but require significant trade-offs between nominal performance, degree of robustness, computational requirements, and theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose and study a GP model that achieves robustness against sparse outliers by simply inferring data-point-specific noise levels with a sequential selection procedure maximizing the log marginal likelihood that we refer to as \emph{relevance pursuit}. Surprisingly, we show that a particular parameterization of the model leads the log marginal likelihood to be {\it strongly concave} in the data-point-specific noise variances, a property rarely found in either robust regression objectives or GP marginal likelihoods, which further implies the weak submodularity of the objective, and thereby proves approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm. We compare the model's performance relative to other approaches on diverse regression and Bayesian optimization tasks, including the challenging but common setting of sparse corruptions of the labels within the function range.

Robust Graph Neural Networks via Unbiased Aggregation
The adversarial robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been questioned due to the false sense of security uncovered by strong adaptive attacks despite the existence of numerous defenses.In this work, we delve into the robustness analysis of representative robust GNNs and provide a unified robust estimation point of view tounderstand their robustness and limitations.Our novel analysis of estimation bias motivates the design of a robust and unbiased graph signal estimator. We then develop an efficient Quasi-Newton Iterative Reweighted Least Squares algorithm to solve the estimation problem, which is unfolded as robust unbiased aggregation layers in GNNs with theoretical guarantees.Our comprehensive experiments confirm the strong robustness of our proposed model under various scenarios, and the ablation study provides a deep understanding of its advantages.

Robust group and simultaneous inferences for high-dimensional single index model
The high-dimensional single index model (SIM), which assumes that the response is independent of the predictors given a linear combination of predictors, has drawn attention due to its flexibility and interpretability, but its efficiency is adversely affected by outlying observations and heavy-tailed distributions. This paper introduces a robust procedure by recasting the SIM into a pseudo-linear model with transformed responses. It relaxes the distributional conditions on random errors from sub-Gaussian to more general distributions and thus it is robust with substantial efficiency gain for heavy-tailed random errors. Under this paradigm, we provide asymptotically honest group inference procedures based on the idea of orthogonalization, which enjoys the feature that it does not require the zero and nonzero coefficients to be well-separated. Asymptotic null distribution and bootstrap implementation are both established. Moreover, we develop a multiple testing procedure for determining if the individual coefficients are relevant simultaneously, and show that it is able to control the false discovery rate asymptotically. Numerical results indicate that the new procedures can be highly competitive among existing methods, especially for heavy-tailed errors.

Robustly overfitting latents for flexible neural image compression
Neural image compression has made a great deal of progress. State-of-the-art models are based on variational autoencoders and are outperforming classical models. Neural compression models learn to encode an image into a quantized latent representation that can be efficiently sent to the decoder, which decodes the quantized latent into a reconstructed image. While these models have proven successful in practice, they lead to sub-optimal results due to imperfect optimization and limitations in the encoder and decoder capacity. Recent work shows how to use stochastic Gumbel annealing (SGA) to refine the latents of pre-trained neural image compression models. We extend this idea by introducing SGA+, which contains three different methods that build upon SGA.We show how our method improves the overall compression performance in terms of the R-D trade-off, compared to its predecessors. Additionally, we show how refinement of the latents with our best-performing method improves the compression performance on both the Tecnick and CLIC dataset. Our method is deployed for a pre-trained hyperprior and for a more flexible model.Further, we give a detailed analysis of our proposed methods and show that they are less sensitive to hyperparameter choices. Finally, we show how each method can be extended to three- instead of two-class rounding.

Robust Mixture Learning when Outliers Overwhelm Small Groups
We study the problem of estimating the means of well-separated mixtures when an adversary may add arbitrary outliers. While strong guarantees are available when the outlier fraction is significantly smaller than the minimum mixing weight, much less is known when outliers may crowd out low-weight clusters – a setting we refer to as list-decodable mixture learning (LD-ML). In this case, adversarial outliers can simulate additional spurious mixture components. Hence, if all means of the mixture must be recovered up to a small error in the output list, the list size needs to be larger than the number of (true) components. We propose an algorithm that obtains order-optimal error guarantees for each mixture mean with a minimal list-size overhead, significantly improving upon list-decodable mean estimation, the only existing method that is applicable for LD-ML. Although improvements are observed even when the mixture is non-separated, our algorithm achieves particularly strong guarantees when the mixture is separated: it can leverage the mixture structure to partially cluster the samples before carefully iterating a base learner for list-decodable mean estimation at different scales.

Robust Neural Contextual Bandit against Adversarial Corruptions
Contextual bandit algorithms aim to identify the optimal arm with the highest reward among a set of candidates, based on the accessible contextual information. Among these algorithms, neural contextual bandit methods have shown generally superior performances against linear and kernel ones, due to the representation power of neural networks. However, similar to other neural network applications, neural bandit algorithms can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks or corruptions on the received labels (i.e., arm rewards), which can lead to unexpected performance degradation without proper treatments. As a result, it is necessary to improve the robustness of neural bandit models against potential reward corruptions. In this work, we propose a novel neural contextual bandit algorithm named R-NeuralUCB, which utilizes a novel context-aware Gradient Descent (GD) training strategy to improve the robustness against adversarial reward corruptions. Under over-parameterized neural network settings, we provide regret analysis for R-NeuralUCB to quantify reward corruption impacts, without the commonly adopted arm separateness assumption in existing neural bandit works. We also conduct experiments against baselines on real data sets under different scenarios, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed R-NeuralUCB.

Robust Offline Active Learning on Graphs
We consider the problem of active learning on graphs, which has crucial applications in many real-world networks where labeling node responses is expensive. In this paper, we propose an offline active learning method that selects nodes to query by explicitly incorporating information from both the network structure and node covariates. Building on graph signal recovery theories and the random spectral sparsification technique, the proposed method adopts a two-stage biased sampling strategy that takes both informativeness and representativeness into consideration for node querying. Informativeness refers to the complexity of graph signals that are learnable from the responses of queried nodes, while representativeness refers to the capacity of queried nodes to control generalization errors given noisy node-level information. We establish a theoretical relationship between generalization error and the number of nodes selected by the proposed method. Our theoretical results demonstrate the trade-off between informativeness and representativeness in active learning.  Extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed method is competitive with existing graph-based active learning methods, especially when node covariates and responses contain noises. Additionally, the proposed method is applicable to both regression and classification tasks on graphs.

Robust Reinforcement Learning with General Utility
Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem with general utility is a powerful decision making framework that covers standard RL with cumulative cost, exploration problems and demonstration learning. Existing works on RL with general utility do not consider robustness under environmental perturbation, which is important to adapt RL system to the real-world environment that differs from the training environment. To train a robust policy, we propose a robust RL framework with general utility. For popular convex utility functions which yield a nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization problem, we design a two-phase stochastic policy gradient based algorithm and obtain its sample complexity result for gradient convergence. Furthermore, for convex utility on a widely used polyhedral ambiguity set, we design an algorithm and obtain its convergence rate to a global optimal solution. Finally, we also design algorithms with provable gradient convergence for concave utilities and utilities that satisfy weak Minty variational inequality.

Robust Sleep Staging over Incomplete Multimodal Physiological Signals via Contrastive Imagination
Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, EOG and EMG, provide rich and reliable physiological information for automated sleep staging (ASS). However, in the real world, the completeness of various modalities is difficult to guarantee, which seriously affects the performance of ASS based on multimodal learning. Furthermore, the exploration of temporal context information within PTSs is also a serious challenge. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal sleep staging framework named contrastive imagination modality sleep network (CIMSleepNet). Specifically, CIMSleepNet handles the issue of arbitrary modal missing through the combination of modal awareness imagination module (MAIM) and semantic & modal calibration contrastive learning (SMCCL). Among them, MAIM can capture the interaction among modalities by learning the shared representation distribution of all modalities. Meanwhile, SMCCL introduces prior information of semantics and modalities to check semantic consistency while maintaining the uniqueness of each modality. Utilizing the calibration of SMCCL, the data distribution recovered by MAIM is aligned with the real data distribution. We further design a multi-level cross-branch temporal attention mechanism, which can facilitate the mining of interactive temporal context representations at both the intra-epoch and inter-epoch levels. Extensive experiments on five multimodal sleep datasets demonstrate that CIMSleepNet remarkably outperforms other competitive methods under various missing modality patterns. The code is in the supplementary material.

Robust Sparse Regression with Non-Isotropic Designs
We develop a technique to design efficiently computable estimators for sparse linear regression in the simultaneous presence of two adversaries: oblivious and adaptive.Consider the model $y^*=X^*\beta^*+ \eta$ where $X^*$ is an $n\times d$ random design matrix, $\beta^*\in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $k$-sparse vector, and the noise $\eta$ is independent of $X^*$ and chosen by the \emph{oblivious adversary}. Apart from the independence of $X^*$, we only require a small fraction entries of $\eta$ to have magnitude at most $1$. The \emph{adaptive adversary} is allowed to arbitrarily corrupt an $\varepsilon$-fraction of the samples $(X_1^*, y_1^*),\ldots, (X_n^*, y_n^*)$.Given the $\varepsilon$-corrupted samples $(X_1, y_1),\ldots, (X_n, y_n)$, the goal is to estimate $\beta^*$.  We assume that the rows of $X^*$ are iid samples from some $d$-dimensional distribution $\mathcal{D}$  with zero mean and (unknown) covariance matrix $\Sigma$ with bounded condition number.We design several robust algorithms that outperform the state of the art even in the special case of Gaussian noise $\eta \sim N(0,1)^n$. In particular, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that with high probability recovers $\beta^*$ up to error $O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$  as long as  $n \ge \tilde{O}(k^2/\varepsilon)$, only assuming some bounds on the third and the fourth moments of $\mathcal{D}$. In addition, prior to this work, even in the special case of Gaussian design $\mathcal{D} = N(0,\Sigma)$ and noise $\eta \sim N(0,1)$, no polynomial time algorithm was known to achieve error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ in the sparse setting $n < d^2$.  We show that under some assumptions on the fourth and the eighth moments of $\mathcal{D}$, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ as long as $n \ge \tilde{O}(k^4 / \varepsilon^3)$. For Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{D} = N(0,\Sigma)$, this algorithm achieves error $O(\varepsilon^{3/4})$. Moreover, our algorithm achieves error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ for all log-concave distributions if $\varepsilon \le 1/\text{polylog(d)}$. Our algorithms are based on the filtering  of the covariates that uses sum-of-squares relaxations, and weighted Huber loss minimization with $\ell_1$ regularizer.  We provide a novel analysis of weighted penalized Huber loss that is suitable for heavy-tailed designs in the presence of two adversaries. Furthermore, we complement our algorithmic results with Statistical Query lower bounds, providing evidence that our estimators are likely to have nearly optimal sample complexity.

Rough Transformers: Lightweight Continuous-Time Sequence Modelling with Path Signatures
Time-series data in real-world settings typically exhibit long-range dependencies and are observed at non-uniform intervals. In these settings, traditional sequence-based recurrent models struggle. To overcome this, researchers often replace recurrent models with Neural ODE-based architectures to account for irregularly sampled data and use  Transformer-based architectures to account for long-range dependencies. Despite the success of these two approaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of even moderate length. To address this challenge, we introduce the Rough Transformer, a variation of the Transformer model that operates on continuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly lower computational costs. In particular, we propose multi-view signature attention, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to capture both local and global (multi-scale) dependencies in the input data, while remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency and yielding improved spatial processing. We find that, on a variety of time-series-related tasks, Rough Transformers consistently outperform their vanilla attention counterparts while obtaining the representational benefits of Neural ODE-based models, all at a fraction of the computational time and memory resources.

S$^{2}$FT: Efficient, Scalable and Generalizable LLM Fine-tuning by Structured Sparsity
Current PEFT methods for LLMs can achieve either high quality, efficient training, or scalable serving, but not all three simultaneously.  To address this limitation, we investigate sparse fine-tuning and observe a remarkable improvement in generalization ability. Utilizing this key insight, we propose a family of Structured Sparse Fine-Tuning (S$^{2}$FT) methods for LLMs, which concurrently achieve state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance, training efficiency, and inference scalability. S$^{2}$FT accomplishes this by "selecting sparsely and computing densely". It selects only a few heads in the MHA module and a few channels in the FFN module for each Transformer Block. Next, it co-permutes the weight matrices on both sides of the coupled structures in LLMs to connect these selected components, yielding multiple compact, dense, and trainable weight submatrices. Finally, \model updates these submatrices to perform PEFT.Through theoretical analysis and empirical results, our method prevents overfitting and forgetting, delivers SOTA performance on established benchmarks with improvements up to 4.1%, and outperforms full FT by 7.1% in generalization tasks. By integrating our partial back-propagation algorithm, S$^{2}$FT saves the fine-tuning memory upto 3$\times$ and improves the throughput by 1.5 - 2.7$\times$ compared to full FT. We further show that S$^{2}$FT:can be written into low-rank format, enabling scalable batched serving of multiple fine-tuned models.

S2HPruner: Soft-to-Hard Distillation Bridges the Discretization Gap in Pruning
Recently, differentiable mask pruning methods optimize the continuous relaxation architecture (soft network) as the proxy of the pruned discrete network (hard network) for superior sub-architecture search. However, due to the agnostic impact of the discretization process, the hard network struggles with the equivalent representational capacity as the soft network, namely discretization gap, which severely spoils the pruning performance. In this paper, we first investigate the discretization gap and propose a novel structural differentiable mask pruning framework named S2HPruner to bridge the discretization gap in a one-stage manner. In the training procedure, SH2Pruner forwards both the soft network and its corresponding hard network, then distills the hard network under the supervision of the soft network. To optimize the mask and prevent performance degradation, we propose a decoupled bidirectional knowledge distillation. It blocks the weight updating from the hard to the soft network while maintaining the gradient corresponding to the mask. Compared with existing pruning arts, S2HPruner achieves surpassing pruning performance without fine-tuning on comprehensive benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet with a variety of network architectures. Besides, investigation and analysis experiments explain the effectiveness of S2HPruner. Codes will be released soon.

Safe and Sparse Newton Method for Entropic-Regularized Optimal Transport
Computational optimal transport (OT) has received massive interests in the machine learning community, and great advances have been gained in the direction of entropic-regularized OT. The Sinkhorn algorithm, as well as its many improved versions, has become the *de facto* solution to large-scale OT problems. However, most of the existing methods behave like first-order methods, which typically require a large number of iterations to converge. More recently, Newton-type methods using sparsified Hessian matrices have demonstrated promising results on OT computation, but there still remain a lot of unresolved open questions. In this article, we make major new progresses towards this direction: first, we propose a novel Hessian sparsification scheme that promises a strict control of the approximation error; second, based on this sparsification scheme, we develop a *safe* Newton-type method that is guaranteed to avoid singularity in computing the search directions; third, the developed algorithm has a clear implementation for practical use, avoiding most hyperparameter tuning; and remarkably, we provide rigorous global and local convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, which is lacking in the prior literature. Various numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving large-scale OT problems.

Safe Exploitative Play in Stochastic Bayesian Games with Untrusted Type Beliefs
The combination of the Bayesian game and learning has a rich history, with the idea of controlling a single agent in a system composed of multiple agents with unknown behaviors given a set of types, each specifying a possible behavior for the other agents. The idea is to plan an agent's own actions with respect to those types which it believes are most likely to maximize the payoff. However, the type beliefs are often learned from past actions and likely to be incorrect. With this perspective in mind, we consider an agent in a game with type predictions of other components, and investigate the impact of incorrect beliefs to the agent’s payoff. In particular, we formally define a trade-off between risk and opportunity by comparing the payoff obtained against the optimal payoff, which is represented by a gap caused by trusting or distrusting the learned beliefs. Our main results characterize the trade-off by providing upper and lower bounds on the payoff gap for both normal-form and stochastic Bayesian games, with numerical results provided.

SAFE: Slow and Fast Parameter-Efﬁcient Tuning for Continual Learning with Pre-Trained Models
Continual learning aims to incrementally acquire new concepts in data streams while resisting forgetting previous knowledge.  With the rise of powerful pre-trained models (PTMs), there is a growing interest of training incremental learning systems using these foundation models, rather than learning from scratch.   Existing works often view PTMs as a strong initial point and directly apply parameter-efficient tuning (PET) in the first session for adapting to downstream tasks.  In the following sessions, most methods freeze model parameters for tackling forgetting issues.   However, applying PET directly to downstream data cannot fully explore the inherent knowledge in PTMs.  Additionally, freezing the parameters in incremental sessions hinders models' plasticity to novel concepts not covered in the first session.   To solve the above issues, we propose a Slow And Fast parameter-Efficient tuning (SAFE) framework.  In particular, to inherit general knowledge from foundation models, we include a transfer loss function by measuring the correlation between the PTM and the PET-applied model.  After calibrating in the first session, the slow efficient tuning parameters can capture more informative features, improving generalization to incoming classes.  Moreover, to further incorporate novel concepts, we strike a balance between stability and plasticity by fixing slow efficient tuning parameters and continuously updating the fast ones.  Specifically, a cross-classification loss with feature alignment is proposed to circumvent catastrophic forgetting.  During inference, we introduce an entropy-based aggregation strategy to dynamically utilize the complementarity in the slow and fast learners.  Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method by significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art.  Codes will be available upon acceptance.

Safety through feedback in Constrained RL
In safety-critical RL settings, the inclusion of an additional cost function is often favoured over the arduous task of modifying the reward function to ensure the agent's safe behaviour. However, designing or evaluating such a cost function can be prohibitively expensive. For instance, in the domain of self-driving, designing a cost function that encompasses all unsafe behaviours (e.g., aggressive lane changes, risky overtakes) is inherently complex, it must also consider all the actors present in the scene making it expensive to evaluate. In such scenarios, the cost function can be learned from feedback collected offline in between training rounds. This feedback can be system generated or elicited from a human observing the training process. Previous approaches have not been able to scale to complex environments and are constrained to receiving feedback at the state level which can be expensive to collect. To this end, we introduce an approach that scales to more complex domains and extends to beyond state-level feedback, thus, reducing the burden on the evaluator. Inferring the cost function in such settings poses challenges, particularly in assigning credit to individual states based on trajectory-level feedback. To address this, we propose a surrogate objective that transforms the problem into a state-level supervised classification task with noisy labels, which can be solved efficiently. Additionally, it is often infeasible to collect feedback on every trajectory generated by the agent, hence, two fundamental questions arise: (1) Which trajectories should be presented to the human? and (2) How many trajectories are necessary for effective learning? To address these questions, we introduce a \textit{novelty-based sampling} mechanism that selectively involves the evaluator only when the the agent encounters a \textit{novel} trajectory, and discontinues querying once the trajectories are no longer \textit{novel}. We showcase the efficiency of our method through experimentation on several benchmark Safety Gymnasium environments and realistic self-driving scenarios. Our method achieves near optimal performance (to when the cost function is known) just from gathering feedback at the trajectory level in many of the domains underscoring the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.

Saliency-driven Experience Replay for Continual Learning
We present Saliency-driven Experience Replay - SER - a biologically-plausible approach based on replicating human visual saliency to enhance classification models in continual learning settings. Inspired by neurophysiological evidence that the primary visual cortex does not contribute to object manifold untangling for categorization and that primordial saliency biases are still embedded in the modern brain, we propose to employ auxiliary saliency prediction features as a modulation signal to drive and stabilize the learning of a sequence of non-i.i.d. classification tasks. Experimental results confirm that SER effectively enhances the performance (in some cases up to about twenty percent points) of state-of-the-art continual learning methods, both in class-incremental and task-incremental settings. Moreover, we show that saliency-based modulation successfully encourages the learning of features that are more robust to the presence of spurious features and to adversarial attacks than baseline methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

SAM-Guided Masked Token Prediction for 3D Scene Understanding
Foundation models have significantly enhanced 2D task performance, and recent works like Bridge3D have successfully applied these models to improve 3D scene understanding through knowledge distillation, marking considerable advancements. Nonetheless, challenges such as the misalignment between 2D and 3D representations and the persistent long-tail distribution in 3D datasets still restrict the effectiveness of knowledge distillation from 2D to 3D using foundation models. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel SAM-guided tokenization method that seamlessly aligns 3D transformer structures with region-level knowledge distillation, replacing the traditional KNN-based tokenization techniques. Additionally, we implement a group-balanced re-weighting strategy to effectively address the long-tail problem in knowledge distillation. Furthermore, inspired by the recent success of masked feature prediction, our framework incorporates a two-stage masked token prediction process in which the student model predicts both the global embeddings and token-wise local embeddings derived from the teacher models trained in the first stage. Our methodology has been validated across multiple datasets, including SUN RGB-D, ScanNet, and S3DIS, for tasks like 3D object detection and semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate significant improvements over current state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, establishing new benchmarks in this field.

SampDetox: Black-box Backdoor Defense via Perturbation-based Sample Detoxification
The advancement of Machine Learning has enabled the widespread deployment of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) applications. However, the untrustworthy nature of third-party ML services poses backdoor threats. Existing defenses in MLaaS are limited by their reliance on training samples or white-box model analysis, highlighting the need for a black-box backdoor purification method. In our paper, we attempt to use diffusion models for purification by introducing noise in a forward diffusion process to destroy backdoors and recover clean samples through a reverse generative process. However, since a higher noise also destroys the semantics of the original samples, it still results in a low restoration performance. To investigate the effectiveness of noise in eliminating different types of backdoors, we conducted a preliminary study, which demonstrates that backdoors with low visibility can be easily destroyed by lightweight noise and those with high visibility need to be destroyed by high noise but can be easily detected. Based on the study, we propose SampDetox, which strategically combines lightweight and high noise. SampDetox applies weak noise to eliminate low-visibility backdoors and compares the structural similarity between the recovered and original samples to localize high-visibility backdoors. Intensive noise is then applied to these localized areas, destroying the high-visibility backdoors while preserving global semantic information. As a result, detoxified samples can be used for inference, even by poisoned models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SampDetox in defending against various state-of-the-art backdoor attacks.

Sample and Computationally Efficient Robust Learning of Gaussian Single-Index Models
A single-index model (SIM) is a function of the form $\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\ast} \cdot \mathbf{x})$, where$\sigma: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a known link function and $\mathbf{w}^{\ast}$ is a hidden unit vector. We study the task of learning SIMs in the agnostic (a.k.a. adversarial label noise) model with respect to the $L^2_2$-loss under the Gaussian distribution. Our main result is a sample and computationally efficient agnostic proper learner that attains $L^2_2$-error of $O(\mathrm{OPT})+\epsilon$, where $\mathrm{OPT}$ is the optimal loss. The sample complexity of our algorithm is $\tilde{O}(d^{\lceil k^{\ast}/2\rceil}+d/\epsilon)$, where $k^{\ast}$ is the information-exponent of $\sigma$ corresponding to the degree of its first non-zero Hermite coefficient. This sample bound nearly matches known CSQ lower bounds, even in the realizable setting. Prior algorithmic work in this setting had focused on learning in the realizable case or in the presence of semi-random noise. Prior computationally efficient robust learners required significantly stronger assumptions on the link function.

Sample Complexity of Algorithm Selection Using Neural Networks and Its Applications to Branch-and-Cut
Data-driven algorithm design is a paradigm that uses statistical and machine learning techniques to select from a class of algorithms for a computational problem an algorithm that has the best expected performance with respect to some (unknown) distribution on the instances of the problem. We build upon recent work in this line of research by considering the setup where, instead of selecting a single algorithm that has the best performance, we allow the possibility of selecting an algorithm based on the instance to be solved, using neural networks. In particular, given a representative sample of instances, we learn a neural network that maps an instance of the problem to the most appropriate algorithm *for that instance*. We formalize this idea and derive rigorous sample complexity bounds for this learning problem, in the spirit of recent work in data-driven algorithm design. We then apply this approach to the problem of making good decisions in the branch-and-cut framework for mixed-integer optimization (e.g., which cut to add?). In other words, the neural network will take as input a mixed-integer optimization instance and output a decision that will result in a small branch-and-cut tree for that instance. Our computational results provide evidence that our particular way of using neural networks for cut selection can make a significant impact in reducing branch-and-cut tree sizes, compared to previous data-driven approaches.

Sample Complexity of Interventional Causal Representation Learning
Consider a data-generation process that transforms low-dimensional _latent_ causally-related variables to high-dimensional _observed_ variables. Causal representation learning (CRL) is the process of using the observed data to recover the latent causal variables and the causal structure among them. Despite the multitude of identifiability results under various interventional CRL settings, the existing guarantees apply exclusively to the _infinite-sample_ regime (i.e., infinite observed samples). This paper establishes the first sample-complexity analysis for the finite-sample regime, in which the interactions between the number of observed samples and probabilistic guarantees on recovering the latent variables and structure are established. This paper focuses on _general_ latent causal models, stochastic _soft_ interventions, and a linear transformation from the latent to the observation space. The identifiability results ensure graph recovery up to ancestors and latent variables recovery up to mixing with parent variables. Specifically, ${\cal O}((\log \frac{1}{\delta})^{4})$ samples suffice for latent graph recovery up to ancestors with probability $1 - \delta$, and ${\cal O}((\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log \frac{1}{\delta})^{4})$ samples suffice for latent causal variables recovery that is $\epsilon$ close to the identifiability class with probability $1 - \delta$.

Sample Complexity of Posted Pricing for a Single Item
Selling a single item to $n$ self-interested bidders is a fundamental problem in economics, where the two  objectives  typically considered are welfare maximization and revenue maximization.   Since the optimal auctions are often impractical and do not work for sequential bidders, posted pricing auctions, where fixed prices are set for the item for different bidders, have emerged as a practical and effective alternative. This paper investigates how many samples are needed from bidders' value distributions to find near-optimal posted prices, considering both independent and correlated bidder distributions, and welfare versus revenue maximization.  We obtain matching upper and lower bounds (up to logarithmic terms) on the sample complexity for all these settings.

Sample Efficient Bayesian Learning of Causal Graphs from Interventions
Causal discovery is a fundamental problem with applications spanning various areas in science and engineering. It is well understood that solely using observational data, one can only orient the causal graph up to its Markov equivalence class, necessitating interventional data to learn the complete causal graph. Most works in the literature design causal discovery policies with perfect interventions, i.e., they have access to infinite interventional samples. This study considers a Bayesian approach for learning causal graphs with limited interventional samples, mirroring real-world scenarios where such samples are usually costly to obtain. By leveraging the recent result of Wienöbst et al. [2023] on uniform DAG sampling in polynomial time, we can efficiently enumerate all the cut configurations and their corresponding interventional distributions of a target set, and further track their posteriors. Given any number of interventional samples, our proposed algorithm randomly intervenes on a set of target vertices that cut all the edges in the graph and returns a causal graph according to the posterior of each target set. When the number of interventional samples is large enough, we show theoretically that our proposed algorithm will return the true causal graph with high probability. We compare our algorithm against various baseline methods on simulated datasets, demonstrating its superior accuracy measured by the structural Hamming distance between the learned DAG and the ground truth. Additionally, we present a case study showing how this algorithm could be modified to answer more general causal questions without learning the whole graph. For instance, we illustrate that our method can be used to estimate the posterior of a set being the backdoor adjustment set for a causal query.

Sample-efficient Bayesian Optimisation Using Known Invariances
Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a powerful framework for global optimisation of costly functions, using predictions from Gaussian process models (GPs). In this work, we apply BO to functions that exhibit *invariance* to a known group of transformations. We show that vanilla BO algorithms are inefficient when optimising such invariant objectives, and provide a method for incorporating group invariances into the kernel of the GP to produce *invariance-aware* algorithms that achieve significant improvements in sample efficiency. In particular, we derive a bound on the maximum information gain of these invariant kernels, and provide novel upper and lower bounds on the number of observations required for invariance-aware BO algorithms to achieve $\epsilon$-optimality.  We demonstrate our method's improved performance on a range of synthetic functions. We also apply our method to a *partially specified* setting, where the kernel is only invariant to a subset of the group, and find that these kernels achieve similar gains in sample efficiency at significantly reduced computational cost. Finally, we use invariant BO to design a current drive system for a nuclear fusion reactor, finding a high-performance solution where non-invariant methods failed.

Sample-Efficient Geometry Reconstruction from Euclidean Distances using Non-Convex Optimization
The problem of finding suitable point embeddings or geometric configurations given only Euclidean distance information of point pairs arises both as a core task and as a subproblem in a variety of machine learning applications. In this paper, we aim to solve this problem given a minimal number of distance samples. To this end, we leverage continuous and non-convex rank minimization formulations of the problem and establish a local convergence  guarantee for a variant of iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), which applies if a minimal random set of observed distances is provided. As a technical tool, we establish a restricted isometry property (RIP) restricted to a tangent space of the manifold of symmetric rank-$r$ matrices given random Euclidean distance  measurements, which might be of independent interest for the analysis of other non-convex approaches.  Furthermore, we assess data efficiency, scalability and generalizability of different reconstruction algorithms through numerical experiments with simulated data as well as real-world data, demonstrating the proposed algorithm's ability to identify the underlying geometry from fewer distance samples compared to the state-of-the-art.

Sample Selection via Contrastive Fragmentation for Noisy Label Regression
As with many other problems, real-world regression is plagued by the presence of noisy labels, an inevitable issue that demands our attention. Fortunately, much real-world data often exhibits an intrinsic property of continuously ordered correlations between labels and features, where data points with similar labels are also represented with closely related features.In response, we propose a novel approach named ConFrag, where we collectively model the regression data by transforming them into disjoint yet contrasting fragmentation pairs. This enables the training of more distinctive representations, enhancing the ability to select clean samples.Our ConFrag framework leverages a mixture of neighboring fragments to discern noisy labels through neighborhood agreement among expert feature extractors.We extensively perform experiments on four newly curated benchmark datasets of diverse domains, including age prediction, price prediction, and music production year estimation.We also introduce a metric called Error Residual Ratio (ERR) to better account for varying degrees of label noise.Our approach consistently outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art baselines, being robust against symmetric and random Gaussian label noise.

SAND: Smooth imputation of sparse and noisy functional data with Transformer networks
Although the transformer architecture has come to dominate other models for text and image data, its application to irregularly-spaced longitudinal data has been limited. We introduce a variant of the transformer that enables it to more smoothly impute such functional data. We augment the vanilla transformer with a simple module we call SAND (self-attention on derivatives), which naturally encourages smoothness by modeling the sub-derivative of the imputed curve. On the theoretical front, we prove the number of hidden nodes required by a network with SAND to achieve an $\epsilon$ prediction error bound for functional imputation. Extensive experiments over various types of functional data demonstrate that transformers with SAND produce better imputations than both their standard counterparts as well as transformers augmented with alternative approaches to encode the inductive bias of smoothness. SAND also outperforms standard statistical methods for functional imputation like kernel smoothing and PACE.

SARAD: Spatial Association-Aware Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis for Multivariate Time Series
Anomaly detection in time series data is fundamental to the design, deployment, and evaluation of industrial control systems. Temporal modeling has been the natural focus of anomaly detection approaches for time series data. However, the focus on temporal modeling can obscure or dilute the spatial information that can be used to capture complex interactions in multivariate time series. In this paper, we propose SARAD, an approach that leverages spatial information beyond data autoencoding errors to improve the detection and diagnosis of anomalies. SARAD trains a Transformer to learn the spatial associations, the pairwise inter-feature relationships which ubiquitously characterize such feedback-controlled systems. As new associations form and old ones dissolve, SARAD applies subseries division to capture their changes over time. Anomalies exhibit association descending patterns, a key phenomenon we exclusively observe and attribute to the disruptive nature of anomalies detaching anomalous features from others. To exploit the phenomenon and yet dismiss non-anomalous descent, SARAD performs anomaly detection via autoencoding in the association space. We present experimental results to demonstrate that SARAD achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing robust anomaly detection and a nuanced understanding of anomalous events.

Scalable and Stable Parallelization of Nonlinear RNNs
Conventional nonlinear RNNs are not naturally parallelizable across the sequence length, whereas transformers and linear RNNs are.Lim et al. therefore tackle parallelized evaluation of nonlinear RNNs by posing it as a fixed point problem, solved with Newton's method. By deriving and applying a parallelized form of Newton's method, they achieve huge speedups over sequential evaluation. However, their approach inherits cubic computational complexity and numerical instability. We tackle these weaknesses. To reduce the computational complexity, we apply quasi-Newton approximations and show they converge comparably to full-Newton, use less memory, and are faster.To stabilize Newton's method, we leverage a connection between Newton's method damped with trust regions and Kalman smoothing. This connection allows us to stabilize Newtons method, per the trust region, while using efficient parallelized Kalman algorithms to retain performance. We compare these methods empirically, and highlight the use cases where each algorithm excels.

Scalable Bayesian Optimization via Focalized Sparse Gaussian Processes
Bayesian optimization is an effective technique for black-box optimization, but its applicability is typically limited to low-dimensional and small-budget problems due to the cubic complexity of computing the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. While various approximate GP models have been employed to scale Bayesian optimization to larger sample sizes, most suffer from overly-smooth estimation and focus primarily on problems that allow for large online samples.  In this work, we argue that Bayesian optimization algorithms with sparse GPs can more efficiently allocate their representational power to relevant regions of the search space. To achieve this, we propose focalized GP, which leverages a novel variational loss function to achieve stronger local prediction, as well as FocalBO, which hierarchically optimizes the focalized GP acquisition function over progressively smaller search spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that FocalBO can efficiently leverage large amounts of offline and online data to achieve state-of-the-art performance on robot morphology design and to control a 585-dimensional musculoskeletal system.

Scalable DBSCAN with Random Projections
We present sDBSCAN, a scalable density-based clustering algorithm in high dimensions with cosine distance. sDBSCAN leverages recent advancements in random projections given a significantly large number of random vectors to quickly identify core points and their neighborhoods, the primary hurdle of density-based clustering. Theoretically, sDBSCAN preserves the DBSCAN’s clustering structure under mild conditions with high probability. To further facilitate sDBSCAN, we present sOPTICS, a scalable visual tool to guide the parameter setting of sDBSCAN. We also extend sDBSCAN and sOPTICS to L2, L1, χ 2 , and Jensen-Shannon distances via random kernel features. Empirically, sDBSCAN is significantly faster and provides higher accuracy than competitive DBSCAN variants on real-world million-pointdata sets. On these data sets, sDBSCAN and sOPTICS run in a few minutes, while the scikit-learn counterparts and other clustering competitors demand several hours or cannot run due to memory constraints.

Scalable Early Childhood Reading Performance Prediction
Models for student reading performance can empower educators and institutions to proactively identify at-risk students, thereby enabling early and tailored instructional interventions. However, there are no suitable publicly available educational datasets for modeling and predicting future reading performance. In this work, we introduce the Enhanced Core Reading Instruction (ECRI) dataset, a novel large-scale longitudinal tabular dataset collected across 44 schools with 6,916 students and 172 teachers. We leverage the dataset to empirically evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art machine learning models to recognize early childhood educational patterns in multivariate and partial measurements. Specifically, we demonstrate a simple self-supervised strategy in which a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) network is pre-trained over masked inputs to outperform several strong baselines while generalizing over diverse educational settings. To facilitate future developments in precise modeling and responsible use of models for individualized and early intervention strategies, we will make our data and code publicly available.

Scalable Neural Network Verification with Branch-and-bound Inferred Cutting Planes
Recently, cutting-plane methods such as GCP-CROWN have been explored to enhance neural network verifiers and made significant advancements. However, GCP-CROWN requires *generic* cutting planes ("cuts") generated from external mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers. Due to the poor scalability of MIP solvers, large neural networks cannot benefit from these cutting planes. In this paper, we exploit the structure of the neural network verification problem to generate efficient and scalable cutting planes *specific* to this problem setting. We propose a novel approach, Branch-and-bound Inferred Cuts with COnstraint Strengthening (BICCOS), that leverages the logical relationships of neurons within verified subproblems in the branch-and-bound search tree, and we introduce cutting planes constraints that preclude these relationships in other subproblems. We develop a mechanism that assigns influence scores to neurons in each path to allow the strengthening of these cuts. Furthermore, we design a multi-tree search technique to identify more cuts, effectively narrowing the search space and accelerating the BaB algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach can generate hundreds of high-quality cuts during the branch-and-bound process and consistently increase the number of verifiable instances compared to other state-of-the-art neural network verifiers on a wide range of benchmarks, including large networks that previous cutting plane methods could not scale to.

Scalable Optimization in the Modular Norm
To improve performance in contemporary deep learning, one is interested in scaling up the neural network in terms of both the number and the size of the layers. When ramping up the width of a single layer, graceful scaling of training has been linked to the need to normalize the weights and their updates in the "natural norm" particular to that layer. In this paper, we significantly generalize this idea by defining the modular norm, which is the natural norm on the full weight space of any neural network architecture. The modular norm is defined recursively in tandem with the network architecture itself. We show that the modular norm has several promising applications. On the practical side, the modular norm can be used to normalize the updates of any base optimizer so that the learning rate becomes transferable across width and depth. This means that the user does not need to compute optimizer-specific scale factors in order to scale training. On the theoretical side, we show that for any neural network built from "well-behaved" atomic modules, the gradient of the network is Lipschitz-continuous in the modular norm, with the Lipschitz constant admitting a simple recursive formula. This characterization opens the door to porting standard ideas in optimization theory over to deep learning. We have created a Python package called Modula that automatically normalizes weight updates in the modular norm of the architecture. Both the Modula package and code for our experiments are provided in the supplementary material.

Scale Equivariant Graph Meta Networks
This paper pertains to an emerging machine learning paradigm: learning higher- order functions, i.e. functions whose inputs are functions themselves, particularly when these inputs are Neural Networks (NNs). With the growing interest in architectures that process NNs, a recurring design principle has permeated the field: adhering to the permutation symmetries arising from the connectionist structure ofNNs. However, are these the sole symmetries present in NN parameterizations? Zooming into most practical activation functions (e.g. sine, ReLU, tanh) answers this question negatively and gives rise to intriguing new symmetries, which we collectively refer to as scaling symmetries, that is, non-zero scalar multiplications and divisions of weights and biases. In this work, we propose Scale Equivariant Graph MetaNetworks - ScaleGMNs, a framework that adapts the Graph Metanetwork (message-passing) paradigm by incorporating scaling symmetries and thus rendering neuron and edge representations equivariant to valid scalings. We introduce novel building blocks, of independent technical interest, that allow for equivariance or invariance with respect to individual scalar multipliers or their product and use them in all components of ScaleGMN. Furthermore, we prove that, under certain expressivity conditions, ScaleGMN can simulate the forward and backward pass of any input feedforward neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method advances the state-of-the-art performance for several datasets and activation functions, highlighting the power of scaling symmetries asan inductive bias for NN processing.

Scale-invariant Optimal Sampling for Rare-events Data and Sparse Models
Subsampling is effective in tackling computational challenges for massive data with rare events.  Overly aggressive subsampling may adversely affect estimation efficiency, and optimal subsampling is essential to mitigate the information loss. However, existing optimal subsampling probabilities depends on data scales, and some scaling transformations may result in inefficient subsamples. This problem is more significant when there are inactive features,because their influence on the subsampling probabilities can be arbitrarily magnified by inappropriate scaling transformations. We tackle this challenge and introduce a scale-invariant optimal subsampling function in the context of adaptive lasso, where inactive features are commonly assumed. Instead of focusing on estimating model parameters, we define an optimal subsampling function to minimize the prediction error. We first introduce the adaptive lasso estimator for rare-events data and establish its oracle properties,thereby validating the use of subsampling. Then we derive a scale-invariant optimal subsampling function that minimizes the prediction error of the inverse probability weighted (IPW) adaptive lasso.  Finally, we present an estimator based on the maximum sampled conditional likelihood (MSCL) to further improve the estimation efficiency. We conduct numerical experiments using both simulated and real-world data sets to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.

ScaleKD: Strong Vision Transformers Could Be Excellent Teachers
In this paper, we question if well pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) models could be used as teachers that exhibit scalable properties to advance cross architecture knowledge distillation research, in the context of adopting mainstream large-scale visual recognition datasets for evaluation. To make this possible, our analysis underlines the importance of seeking effective strategies to align (1) feature computing paradigm differences, (2) model scale differences, and (3) knowledge density differences. By combining three closely coupled components namely cross attention projector, dual-view feature mimicking and teacher parameter perception tailored to address the alignment problems stated above, we present a simple and effective knowledge distillation method, called ScaleKD. Our method can train student backbones that span across a variety of convolutional neural network (CNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and ViT architectures on image classification datasets with significantly improved performance, achieving state-of-the-art distillation performance. For instance, taking a well-trained Swin-L as the teacher model, our method gets 75.15\%|82.03\%|84.16\%|78.63\%|81.96\%|83.93\%|83.80\%|85.53\% top-1 accuracies for MobileNet-V1|ResNet-50|ConvNeXt-T|Mixer-S/16|Mixer-B/16|ViT-S/16|Swin-T|ViT-B/16 models trained on ImageNet-1K dataset from scratch, showing 3.05\%|3.39\%|2.02\%|4.61\%|5.52\%|4.03\%|2.62\%|3.73\% absolute gains to the individually trained counterparts with the same experimental settings. Intriguingly, when scaling up the size of teacher models or their pre-training datasets, our method showcases larger gains to student models. Empirically, the student backbones trained by our method transfer well on downstream MS-COCO and ADE20K datasets. Moreover, our method shows the potential to be an efficient substitution for the time-intensive pre-training of any target student on large-scale datasets if a strong pre-trained ViT is available. The code will be released soon.

Scaling Continuous Latent Variable Models as Probabilistic Integral Circuits
Probabilistic integral circuits (PICs) have been recently introduced as probabilistic models enjoying the key ingredient behind expressive generative models: continuous latent variables (LVs). PICs are symbolic computational graphs defining continuous LV models as hierarchies of functions that are summed and multiplied together, or integrated over some LVs. They are tractable if LVs can be analytically integrated out, otherwise they can be approximated by tractable probabilistic circuits (PC) encoding a hierarchical numerical quadrature process, called QPCs.So far, only tree-shaped PICs have been explored, and training them via numerical quadrature requires memory-intensive processing at scale. In this paper, we address these issues, and present: (i) a pipeline for building DAG-shaped PICs out of arbitrary variable decompositions, (ii) a procedure for training PICs using tensorized circuit architectures, and (iii) neural functional sharing techniques to allow scalable training. In extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of functional sharing and the superiority of QPCs over traditional PCs.

Scaling laws for learning with real and surrogate data
Collecting large quantities of high-quality data can be  prohibitively expensive or impractical, and a bottleneck in machine learning. One may instead augment a small set of $n$ data points from the target distribution with data from more accessible sources, e.g. data collected under different circumstances or synthesized by generative models.  We refer to such data  as `surrogate data.' We introduce a weighted empirical risk minimization (ERM) approach for integrating surrogate data into training. We analyze mathematically this method under several classical statistical models, and validate our findings empirically on datasets from different domains. Our main findings are: $(i)$ Integrating surrogate data can significantly reduce the test error on the original distribution. Surprisingly, this can happen \emph{even when the surrogate data is unrelated to the original ones}. We trace back this behavior to the classical Stein's paradox. $(ii)$ In order to reap the benefit of surrogate data, it is crucial to use optimally weighted ERM. $(iii)$ The test error of models trained on mixtures of real and surrogate data is approximately described by a scaling law. This scaling law can be used to predict the optimal weighting scheme, and to choose the amount of surrogate data to add.

Scanning Trojaned Models Using Out-of-Distribution Samples
Scanning for trojan (backdoor) in deep neural networks is crucial due to their significant real-world applications. There has been an increasing focus on developing effective general trojan scanning methods across various trojan attacks. Despite advancements, there remains a shortage of methods that perform effectively without preconceived assumptions about the backdoor attack method. Additionally, we have observed that current methods struggle to identify classifiers trojaned using adversarial training. Motivated by these challenges, our study introduces a novel scanning method named TRODO (TROjan scanning by Detection of adversarial shifts in Out-of-distribution samples). TRODO leverages the concept of "blind spots"—regions where trojaned classifiers erroneously identify out-of-distribution (OOD) samples as in-distribution (ID). We scan for these blind spots by adversarially shifting OOD samples towards in-distribution. The increased likelihood of perturbed OOD samples being classified as ID serves as a signature for trojan detection. TRODO is both trojan and label mapping agnostic, effective even against adversarially trained trojaned classifiers. It is applicable even in scenarios where training data is absent, demonstrating high accuracy and adaptability across various scenarios and datasets, highlighting its potential as a robust trojan scanning strategy.

SCaR: Refining Skill Chaining for Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation via Dual Regularization
Long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks typically involve a series of interrelated sub-tasks spanning multiple execution stages. Skill chaining offers a feasible solution for these tasks by pre-training the skills for each sub-task and linking them sequentially. However, imperfections in skill learning or disturbances during execution can lead to the accumulation of errors in skill chaining process, resulting in execution failures. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve stable and smooth skill chaining for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel skill chaining framework called Skill Chaining via Dual Regularization (SCaR). This framework applies dual regularization to sub-task skill pre-training and fine-tuning, which not only enhances the intra-skill dependencies within each sub-task skill but also reinforces the inter-skill dependencies between sequential sub-task skills, thus ensuring smooth skill chaining and stable long-horizon execution. We evaluate the SCaR framework on two representative long-horizon robotic manipulation simulation benchmarks: IKEA furniture assembly and kitchen organization. Additionally, we conduct real-world validation in desktop robot pick-and-place tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that with the support of SCaR, the robot performs long-horizon tasks with a higher success rate than relevant baselines and is more robust to perturbations.

SceneDiffuser: Efficient and Controllable Driving Simulation Initialization and Rollout
Simulation with realistic and interactive agents represents a key task for autonomous vehicle (AV) software development in order to test AV performance in prescribed, often long-tail scenarios. In this work, we propose SceneDiffuser, a scene-level diffusion prior for traffic simulation. We present a singular framework that unifies two key stages of simulation: scene initialization and scene rollout. Scene initialization refers to generating the initial layout for the traffic in a scene, and scene rollout refers to closed-loop simulation for the behaviors of the agents. While diffusion has been demonstrated to be effective in learning realistic, multimodal agent distributions, two open challenges remain: controllability and closed-loop inference efficiency and realism. To this end, to address controllability challenges, we propose generalized hard constraints, a generalized inference-time constraint mechanism that is simple yet effective. To improve closed-loop inference quality and efficiency, we propose amortized diffusion, a novel diffusion denoising paradigm that amortizes the physical cost of denoising over future simulation rollout steps, reducing the cost of per physical rollout step to a single denoising function evaluation, while dramatically reducing closed-loop errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Waymo Open Dataset, where we are able to generate distributionally realistic scenes, while obtaining competitive performance in the Sim Agents Challenge, surpassing the state-of-the-art in many realism attributes.

Scene Graph Disentanglement and Composition for Generalizable Complex Image Generation
There has been exciting progress in generating images from natural language or layout conditions. However, these methods struggle to faithfully reproduce complex scenes due to the insufficient modeling of multiple objects and their relationships. To address this issue, we leverage the scene graph, a powerful structured representation, for complex image generation. Different from the previous works that directly use scene graphs for generation, we employ the generative capabilities of variational autoencoders and diffusion models in a generalizable manner, compositing diverse disentangled visual clues from scene graphs. Specifically, we first propose a Semantics-Layout Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) to jointly derive (layouts, semantics) from the input scene graph, which allows a more diverse and reasonable generation in a one-to-many mapping. We then develop a Compositional Masked Attention (CMA) integrated with a diffusion model, incorporating (layouts, semantics) with fine-grained attributes as generation guidance. To further achieve graph manipulation while keeping the visual content consistent, we introduce a Multi-Layered Sampler (MLS) for an "isolated" image editing effect. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms recent competitors based on text, layout, or scene graph, in terms of generation rationality and controllability.

Schedule Your Edit: A Simple yet Effective Diffusion Noise Schedule for Image Editing
Text-guided diffusion models have significantly advanced image editing, enabling high-quality and diverse modifications driven by text prompts. However, effective editing requires inverting the source image into a latent space, a process often hindered by prediction errors inherent in DDIM inversion. These errors accumulate during the diffusion process, resulting in inferior content preservation and edit fidelity, especially with conditional inputs. We address these challenges by investigating the primary contributors to error accumulation in DDIM inversion and identify the singularity problem in traditional noise schedules as a key issue. To resolve this, we introduce the *Logistic Schedule*, a novel noise schedule designed to eliminate singularities, improve inversion stability, and provide a better noise space for image editing. This schedule reduces noise prediction errors, enabling more faithful editing that preserves the original content of the source image. Our approach requires no additional retraining and is compatible with various existing editing methods. Experiments across eight editing tasks demonstrate the Logistic Schedule's superior performance in content preservation and edit fidelity compared to traditional noise schedules, highlighting its adaptability and effectiveness.

Schrodinger Bridge Flow for Unpaired Data Translation
Mass transport problems arise in many areas of machine learning whereby one wants to compute a map transporting one distribution to another. Generative modeling techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DMMs) have been successfully adapted to solve such transport problems, resulting in CycleGAN and Bridge Matching respectively. However, these methods do not approximate Optimal Transport (OT) maps, which are known to have desirable properties. Existing techniques approximating OT maps for high-dimensional data-rich problems, including DDMs-based Rectified Flow and Schrodinger bridge procedures, require fully training a DDM-type model at each iteration, or use mini-batch techniques which can introduce significant errors. We propose a novel algorithm to compute the Schrodinger bridge, a dynamic entropy-regularized version of OT, that eliminates the need to train multiple DDMs-like models. This algorithm corresponds to a discretization of a flow of path measures, referred to as the Schrodinger Bridge Flow, whose only stationary point is the Schrodinger bridge. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a variety of unpaired data translation tasks.

Schur Nets: exploiting local structure for equivariance in higher order graph neural networks
Several recent works have shown that extending the message passing paradigm to subgraphs communicating with other subgraphs, especially via higher order messages, can boost the expressivity of graph neural networks. In such architectures, to faithfully account for local structure such as cycles, the local operations must be equivariant to the automorphism group of the local environment. However, enumerating the automorphism groups of all possible subgraphs of interest and finding appropriate equivariant operations for each one of them separately is hardly feasible. In this paper we propose a solution to this problem based on spectral graph theory that bypasses having to determine the automorphism group entirely and constructs a basis for equivariant operations directly from the graph Laplacian. We show that empirically this approach can boost the performance of GNNs.

SciFIBench: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models for Scientific Figure Interpretation
Large multimodal models (LMMs) have proven flexible and generalisable across many tasks and fields. Although they have strong potential to aid scientific research, their capabilities in this domain are not well characterised. A key aspect of scientific research is the ability to understand and interpret figures, which serve as a rich, compressed source of complex information. In this work, we present SciFIBench, a scientific figure interpretation benchmark. Our main benchmark consists of a 1000-question gold set of multiple-choice questions split between two tasks across 12 categories. The questions are curated from CS arXiv paper figures and captions, using adversarial filtering to find hard negatives and human verification for quality control. We evaluate 27 LMMs on SciFIBench, finding it to be a challenging benchmark. Finally, we investigate the alignment and reasoning faithfulness of the LMMs on augmented question sets from our benchmark. We release SciFIBench to encourage progress in this domain.

Score-based generative models are provably robust: an uncertainty quantification perspective
Through an uncertainty quantification (UQ) perspective, we show that score-based generative models (SGMs) are provably robust to the multiple sources of error in practical implementation. Our primary tool is the Wasserstein uncertainty propagation (WUP) theorem, a model-form UQ bound that describes how the $L^2$ error from learning the score function propagates to a Wasserstein-1 ($\mathbf{d}_1$) ball around the true data distribution under the evolution of the Fokker-Planck equation. We show how errors due to (a) finite sample approximation, (b) early stopping, (c) score-matching objective choice, (d) score function parametrization expressiveness, and (e) reference distribution choice, impact the quality of the generative model in terms of a $\mathbf{d}_1$ bound of computable quantities. The WUP theorem relies on Bernstein estimates for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equations (PDE) and the regularizing properties of diffusion processes. Specifically, PDE regularity theory shows that stochasticity is the key mechanism ensuring SGM algorithms are provably robust. The WUP theorem applies to integral probability metrics beyond $\mathbf{d}_1$, such as the total variation distance and the maximum mean discrepancy. Sample complexity and generalization bounds in $\mathbf{d}_1$ follow directly from the WUP theorem. Our approach requires minimal assumptions, is agnostic to the manifold hypothesis and avoids absolute continuity assumptions for the target distribution. Additionally, our results clarify the trade-offs among multiple error sources in SGMs.

Score Distillation via Reparametrized DDIM
While 2D diffusion models generate realistic, high-detail images, 3D shape generation methods like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)  built on these 2D diffusion models  produce cartoon-like, over-smoothed shapes. To help explain this discrepancy, we show that the image guidance used in Score Distillation can be understood as the velocity field of a 2D denoising generative process, up to the choice of a noise term. In particular, after a change of variables, SDS resembles a high-variance version of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) with a differently-sampled noise term: SDS introduces noise i.i.d. randomly at each step, while DDIM infers it from the previous noise predictions. This excessive variance can lead to over-smoothing and unrealistic outputs. We show that a better noise approximation can be recovered by inverting DDIM in each SDS update step. This modification makes SDS's generative process for 2D images almost identical to DDIM. In 3D, it removes over-smoothing, preserves higher-frequency detail, and brings the generation quality closer to that of 2D samplers. Experimentally, our method achieves better or similar 3D generation quality compared to other state-of-the-art Score Distillation methods, all without training additional neural networks or multi-view supervision, and providing useful insights into relationship between 2D and 3D asset generation with diffusion models.

Score-Optimal Diffusion Schedules
Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) offer a flexible framework for sampling from high dimensional data distributions. DDMs generate a path of probability distributions interpolating between a reference Gaussian distribution and a data distribution by incrementally injecting noise into the data. To numerically simulate the sampling process, a discretisation schedule from the reference back towards clean data must be chosen. An appropriate discretisation schedule is crucial to obtain high quality samples. However, beyond hand crafted heuristics, a general method for choosing this schedule remains elusive. This paper presents a novel algorithm for adaptively selecting an optimal discretisation schedule with respect to a cost that we derive. Our cost measures the work done by the simulation procedure to transport samples from one point in the diffusion path to the next. Our method does not require hyperparameter tuning and adapts to the dynamics and geometry of the diffusion path. Our algorithm only involves the evaluation of the estimated Stein score, making it scalable to existing pre-trained models at inference time and online during training. We find that our learned schedule recovers performant schedules previously only discovered through manual search and obtains competitive FID scores on image datasets.

SCOREQ: Speech Quality Assessment with Contrastive Regression
In this paper, we present SCOREQ, a novel approach for speech quality prediction. SCOREQ is a triplet loss function for contrastive regression that addresses the domain generalisation shortcoming exhibited by state of the art no-reference speech quality metrics. In the paper we: (i) illustrate the problem of L2 loss training failing at capturing the continuous nature of the mean opinion score (MOS) labels; (ii) demonstrate the lack of generalisation through a benchmarking evaluation across several speech domains; (iii) outline our approach and explore the impact of the architectural design decisions through incremental evaluation; (iv) evaluate the final model against state of the art models for a wide variety of data and domains.  The results show that the lack of generalisation observed in state of the art speech quality metrics is addressed by SCOREQ. We conclude that using a triplet loss function for contrastive regression improves generalisation for speech quality prediction models but also has potential utility across a wide range of applications using regression-based predictive models.

Scribbles for All: Benchmarking Scribble Supervised Segmentation Across Datasets
In this work, we introduce *Scribbles for All*, a label and training data generation algorithm for semantic segmentation trained on scribble labels.         Training or fine-tuning semantic segmentation models with weak supervision has become an important topic recently and was subject to significant advances in model quality.        In this setting, scribbles are a promising label type to achieve high quality segmentation results while requiring a much lower annotation effort than usual pixel-wise dense semantic segmentation annotations. The main limitation of scribbles as source for weak supervision is the lack of challenging datasets for scribble segmentation, which hinders the development of novel methods and conclusive evaluations.        To overcome this limitation, *Scribbles for All* provides scribble labels for several popular segmentation datasets and provides an algorithm to automatically generate scribble labels for any dataset with dense annotations, paving the way for new insights and model advancements in the field of weakly supervised segmentation. In addition to providing datasets and algorithm, we evaluate state-of-the-art segmentation models on our datasets and show that the performance relative to supervised models drops to 70-80 % on ADE20K and Cityscapes as opposed to 90 % on ScribbleSup. Moreover, we document diverging robustness against scribble length with the methods.        The datasets, scribble generation algorithm, and baselines are publicly available at https://github.com/wbkit/Scribbles4All

SCube: Instant Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction using VoxSplats
We present SCube, a novel method for reconstructing large-scale 3D scenes (geometry, appearance, and semantics) from a sparse set of posed images. Our method encodes reconstructed scenes using a novel representation, which we call VoxSplats. VoxSplats are a set of Gaussian splats supported on a high-resolution sparse-voxel scaffold. To reconstruct a VoxSplat from images, we employ a hierarchical voxel latent diffusion model conditioned on the input images followed by a feedforward appearance prediction model. The diffusion model generates progressively higher resolution grids in a coarse-to-fine manner, and the appearance network predicts a set of Gaussians within each voxel. From as few as *3 non-overlapping input images*, SCube can generate millions of Gaussians within a $1024^3$ voxel grid spanning *hundreds of meters* in *20 seconds*. Past works tackling scene reconstruction from images either rely on per-scene optimization and fail to reconstruct the scene away from input views (thus requiring dense view coverage as input) or leverage geometric priors based on low-resolution models, which produce blurry results. In contrast, SCube leverages high-resolution sparse networks and produces sharp outputs from few views. We show the superiority of SCube compared to prior art using the Waymo self-driving dataset on 3D reconstruction and demonstrate its applications, such as LiDAR simulation and text-to-scene generation.

SDformer: Similarity-driven Discrete Transformer For Time Series Generation
The superior generation capabilities of Denoised Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have been effectively showcased across a multitude of domains. Recently, the application of DDPMs has extended to time series generation tasks, where they have significantly outperformed other deep generative models, often by a substantial margin. However, we have discovered two main challenges with these methods: 1) the inference time is excessively long; 2) there is potential for improvement in the quality of the generated time series. In this paper, we propose a method based on discrete token modeling technique called Similarity-driven Discrete Transformer (SDformer). Specifically, SDformer utilizes a similarity-driven vector quantization method for learning high-quality discrete token representations of time series, followed by a discrete Transformer for data distribution modeling at the token level. Comprehensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms competing approaches in terms of the generated time series quality while also ensuring a short inference time. Furthermore, without requiring retraining, SDformer can be directly applied to predictive tasks and still achieve commendable results.

SE(3)-bi-equivariant Transformers for Point Cloud Assembly
Given a pair of point clouds, the goal of assembly is to recover a rigid transformation that aligns one point cloud to the other. This task is challenging because the point clouds may be non-overlapped, and they may have arbitrary initial positions. To address these difficulties, we propose a method, called $SE(3)$-bi-equivariant transformer (BITR), based on the $SE(3)$-bi-equivariance prior of the task:it guarantees that when the inputs are rigidly perturbed, the output will transform accordingly.   Due to its equivariance property, BITR can not only handle non-overlapped PCs, but also  guarantee robustness against initial positions. Specifically, BITR first extracts features of the inputs using a novel $SE(3) \times SE(3)$-transformer, and then projects the learned feature to group $SE(3)$ as the output. Moreover, we theoretically show that swap and scale equivariances can be incorporated into BITR, thus it further guarantees stable performance under scaling and swapping the inputs. We experimentally show the effectiveness of BITR in practical tasks.

SeafloorGenAI: A Large-scale Vision-Language Dataset for Seafloor Geological Survey
A major obstacle to the advancements of machine learning models in marine science, particularly in sonar imagery analysis, is the scarcity of AI-ready datasets.  While there have been efforts to make AI-ready sonar image dataset publicly available, they suffer from limitations in terms of environment setting and scale.  To bridge this gap, we introduce $\texttt{SeafloorAI}$ and $\texttt{SeafloorGenAI}$, the first extensive AI-ready datasets for seafloor mapping across $5$ geographic layers.  These datasets, curated in collaboration with marine scientists, facilitate both $\textit{vision}$ and $\textit{vision-language}$-capable machine learning models for sonar imagery.  The dataset consists of $62$ geo-distributed data surveys across $17,300$ square kilometers, with $696$K sonar images, $827$K annotated segmentation masks, and approximately $7$M question-answer pairs.   By making our data processing source code publicly available, we aim to engage the marine science community to enrich the data pool and inspire the machine learning community to develop more robust models.   This collaborative approach will enhance the capabilities and applications of our datasets within both fields.

SEA: State-Exchange Attention for High-Fidelity Physics-Based Transformers
Current approaches using sequential networks have shown promise in estimating field variables of dynamical systems, but most are limited by high rollout error gradients. The unresolved issue of rollout error accumulation results in unreliable estimations as the network predicts further into the future, with each step's error compounding and leading to an increase in inaccuracy.Here, we introduce the State-Exchange Attention (SEA) module, a novel transformer based module enabling information exchange between encoded fields through multi-head cross-attention. The cross-field multidirectional information exchange design enables all state variables in the system to exchange information with one another, capturing physical relationships and symmetries between fields. This enhances the model's ability to represent complex interactions between the field variables, resulting in improved rollout error accumulation. Our results show that the Transformer model integrated with the State-Exchange Attention (SEA) module outperforms competitive baseline models, including the GMR-GMUS Transformer and PbGMR-GMUS Transformer-RealNVP, by 66% and 72%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art error rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SEA module alone can reduce errors by 97% for state variables that are highly dependent on other states of the system.

Second-order forward-mode optimization of recurrent neural networks for neuroscience
A common source of anxiety for the computational neuroscience student is the question “will my recurrent neural network (RNN) model finally learn that task?”. Unlike in machine learning where any architectural modification of an RNN (e.g. GRU or LSTM) is acceptable if it speeds up training, the RNN models trained as _models of brain dynamics_ are subject to plausibility constraints that fundamentally exclude the usual machine learning hacks. The “vanilla” RNNs commonly used in computational neuroscience find themselves plagued by ill-conditioned loss surfaces that complicate training and significantly hinder our capacity to investigate the brain dynamics underlying complex tasks. Moreover, some tasks may require very long time horizons which backpropagation cannot handle given typical GPU memory limits. Here, we develop SOFO, a second-order optimizer that efficiently navigates loss surfaces whilst _not_ requiring backpropagation. By relying instead on easily parallelized batched forward-mode differentiation, SOFO enjoys constant memory cost in time. Morever, unlike most second-order optimizers which involve inherently sequential operations, SOFO's effective use of GPU parallelism yields a per-iteration wallclock time essentially on par with first-order gradient-based optimizers. We show vastly superior performance compared to Adam on a number of RNN tasks, including a difficult double-reaching motor task and the learning of an adaptive Kalman filter algorithm trained over a long horizon.

SeeClear: Semantic Distillation Enhances Pixel Condensation for Video Super-Resolution
Diffusion-based Video Super-Resolution (VSR) is renowned for generating perceptually realistic videos, yet it grapples with maintaining detail consistency across frames due to stochastic fluctuations. The traditional approach of pixel-level alignment is ineffective for diffusion-processed frames because of iterative disruptions. To overcome this, we introduce SeeClear--a novel VSR framework leveraging conditional video generation, orchestrated by instance-centric and channel-wise semantic controls. This framework integrates a Semantic Distiller and a Pixel Condenser, which synergize to extract and upscale semantic details from low-resolution frames. The Instance-Centric Alignment Module (InCAM) utilizes video-clip-wise tokens to dynamically relate pixels within and across frames, enhancing coherency. Additionally, the Channel-wise Texture Aggregation Memory (CaTeGory) infuses extrinsic knowledge, capitalizing on long-standing semantic textures. Our method also innovates the blurring diffusion process with the ResShift mechanism, finely balancing between sharpness and diffusion effects. Comprehensive experiments confirm our framework's advantage over state-of-the-art diffusion-based VSR techniques.

Segment Anything without Supervision
The Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) requires  labor-intensive data labeling---over 20 minutes per image---which  restricts its ability to scale to even larger training sets. In this paper, we present Unsupervised SAM (UnSAM), a "segment anything" model for interactive and automatic whole-image segmentation which does not require human annotations. UnSAM utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy to "discover" the hierarchical structure of visual scenes. We first leverage top-down clustering methods to partition an unlabeled image into instance/semantic level segments.  For all pixels within a segment, a bottom-up clustering method is employed to iteratively merge them into larger groups, thereby forming a hierarchical structure. These unsupervised multi-granular masks are then utilized to supervise model training. Evaluated across seven popular datasets, UnSAM achieves competitive results with the supervised counterpart SAM, and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art in unsupervised segmentation by 11% in terms of AR. Furthermore, we show that supervised SAM can also benefit from our self-supervised labels. By integrating our unsupervised pseudo masks into SA1B's ground-truth masks and training UnSAM with only 1% of SA-1B, a lightly semi-supervised UnSAM can often segment entities overlooked by supervised SAM, exceeding SAM's AR by over 6.7% and AP by 3.9% on SA-1B.

SEL-BALD: Deep Bayesian Active Learning for Selective Labeling with Instance Rejection
Machine learning systems are widely used in many high-stakes contexts in which experimental designs for assigning treatments are infeasible. When evaluating a decision instance is costly, such as investigating a fraud case, or evaluating a biopsy decision, a sample-efficient strategy is needed. However, while existing active learning methods assume humans will always label the instances selected by the machine learning model, in many critical applications, humans may decline to label  instances selected by the machine learning model due to reasons such as regulation constraint, domain knowledge, or algorithmic aversion, thus not sample efficient. In this paper, we propose the Active Learning with Instance Rejection (ALIR) problem, which is a new active learning problem that considers the human discretion behavior for high-stakes decision making problems. We propose new active learning algorithms under deep Bayesian active learning for selective labeling (SEL-BALD) to address the ALIR problem. Our algorithms consider how to acquire information for both the machine learning model and the human discretion model. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

Selective Explanations
Feature attribution methods explain black-box machine learning (ML) models by assigning importance scores to input features. These methods can be computationally expensive for large ML models. To address this challenge, there has been increasing efforts to develop amortized explainers, where a machine learning model is trained to predict feature attribution scores with only one inference. Despite their efficiency,  amortized explainers can produce inaccurate predictions and misleading explanations. In this paper, we propose selective explanations, a novel feature attribution method that (i) detects when amortized explainers generate low-quality explanations and (ii) improves these explanations using a technique called explanations with initial guess. Our selective explanation method allows practitioners to specify the fraction of samples that receive explanations with initial guess, offering a principled way to bridge the gap between amortized explainers (one inference) and their high-quality counterparts (multiple inferences).

Self-Calibrating Conformal Prediction
In regression settings, prediction intervals can often be too wide to directly inform decision-making, especially in situations with a low signal-to-noise ratio. In such cases, point predictions might be employed to determine actions, while prediction intervals help quantify deviations of point predictions from unseen outcomes and assess the risk associated with these decisions. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce Self-Calibrating Conformal Prediction} which builds on two post-hoc calibration approaches ---  Venn-Abers calibration and conformal prediction --- to provide calibrated point predictions and associated prediction intervals with valid coverage conditional on these model predictions in finite samples. In doing so, we extend the original Venn-Abers procedure from binary classification to the regression setting. Real-data experiments illustrate how our approach improves interval efficiency by using calibrated point predictions and provides a meaningful approximation to feature-conditional validity.

Self-Consuming Generative Models with Curated Data Provably Optimize Human Preferences
The rapid progress in generative models has resulted in impressive leaps in generation quality, blurring the lines between synthetic and real data. Web-scale datasets are now prone to the inevitable contamination by synthetic data, directly impacting the training of future generated models.    Already, some theoretical results on self-consuming generative models (a.k.a., iterative retraining) have emerged in the literature, showcasing that either model collapse or stability could be possible depending on the fraction of generated data used at each retraining step.    However, in practice, synthetic data is often subject to human feedback and curated by users before being used and uploaded online. For instance, many interfaces of popular text-to-image generative models, such as Stable Diffusion or Midjourney, produce several variations of an image for a given query which can eventually be curated by the users.    In this paper, we theoretically study the impact of data curation on iterated retraining of generative models and show that it can be seen as an implicit preference optimization mechanism. However, unlike standard preference optimization, the generative model does not have access to the reward function or negative samples needed for pairwise comparisons. We prove that, if the data is curated according to a reward model, then the expected reward of the iterative retraining procedure is maximized. We further provide theoretical results on the stability of the retraining loop when using a positive fraction of real data at each step. Finally, we conduct illustrative experiments on both synthetic datasets and on CIFAR10 showing that such a procedure amplifies biases of the reward model.

Self-Distilled Depth Refinement with Noisy Poisson Fusion
Depth refinement aims to infer high-resolution depth with fine-grained edges and details, refining low-resolution results of depth estimation models. The prevailing methods adopt tile-based manners by merging numerous patches, which lacks efficiency and produces inconsistency. Besides, prior arts suffer from fuzzy depth boundaries and limited generalizability. Analyzing the fundamental reasons for these limitations, we model depth refinement as a noisy Poisson fusion problem with local inconsistency and edge deformation noises. We propose the Self-distilled Depth Refinement (SDDR) framework to enforce robustness against the noises, which mainly consists of depth edge representation and edge-based guidance. With noisy depth predictions as input, SDDR generates low-noise depth edge representations as pseudo-labels by coarse-to-fine self-distillation. Edge-based guidance with edge-guided gradient loss and edge-based fusion loss serves as the optimization objective equivalent to Poisson fusion. When depth maps are better refined, the labels also become more noise-free. Our model can acquire strong robustness to the noises, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, edge quality, efficiency, and generalizability on five different benchmarks. Moreover, directly training another model with edge labels produced by SDDR brings improvements, suggesting that our method could help with training robust refinement models in future works.

Self-Guided Masked Autoencoder
Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly early stages of pre-training. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Self-Refining Diffusion Samplers: Enabling Parallelization via Parareal Iterations
In diffusion models, samples are generated through an iterative refinement process, requiring hundreds of sequential model evaluations. Several recent methods have introduced approximations (fewer discretization steps or distillation) to trade off speed at the cost of sample quality. In contrast, we introduce Self-Refining Diffusion Samplers (SRDS) that retain sample quality and can improve latency at the cost of additional parallel compute. We take inspiration from the Parareal algorithm, a popular numerical method for parallel-in-time integration of differential equations. In SRDS, a quick but rough estimate of a sample is first created and then iteratively refined in parallel through Parareal iterations. SRDS is not only guaranteed to accurately solve the ODE and converge to the serial solution but also benefits from parallelization across the diffusion trajectory, enabling batched inference and pipelining. As we demonstrate for pre-trained diffusion models, the early convergence of this refinement procedure drastically reduces the number of steps required to produce a sample, speeding up generation for example by up to 2.3x on a 100-step StableDiffusion-v2 benchmark.

Self-Supervised Adversarial Training via Diverse Augmented Queries and Self-Supervised Double Perturbation
Recently, there have been some works studying self-supervised adversarial training, a learning paradigm that learns robust features without labels. While those works have narrowed the performance gap between self-supervised adversarial training (SAT) and supervised adversarial training (supervised AT), a well-established formulation of SAT and its connection with supervised AT is under-explored. Based on a simple SAT benchmark, we find that SAT still faces the problem of large robust generation gap and degradation on natural samples. We hypothesize this is due to the lack of data complexity and model regularization and propose a method named as DAQ-SDP (Diverse Augmented Queries Self-supervised Double Perturbation). We first challenge the previous conclusion that complex data augmentations degrade robustness in SAT by using diversely augmented samples as queries to guide adversarial training. Inspired by previous works in supervised AT, we then incorporate a self-supervised double perturbation scheme to self-supervised learning (SSL), which promotes robustness transferable to downstream classification. Our work can be seamlessly combined with models pretrained by different SSL frameworks without revising the learning objectives and helps to bridge the gap between SAT and AT. Our method also improves both robust and natural accuracies across different SSL frameworks.

Self-Taught Recognizer: Toward Unsupervised Adaptation for Speech Foundation Models
We propose an unsupervised adaptation framework, Self-TAught Recognizer (STAR), which leverages unlabeled data to enhance the robustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in diverse target domains, such as noise and accents. STAR is developed for prevalent speech foundation models based on Transformer-related architecture with auto-regressive decoding (e.g., Whisper, Canary). Specifically, we propose a novel indicator that empirically integrates step-wise information during decoding to assess the token-level quality of pseudo labels without ground truth, thereby guiding model updates for effective unsupervised adaptation. Experimental results show that STAR achieves an average of 13.5% relative reduction in word error rate across 14 target domains, and it sometimes even approaches the upper-bound performance of supervised adaptation. Surprisingly, we also observe that STAR prevents the adapted model from the common catastrophic forgetting problem without recalling source-domain data. Furthermore, STAR exhibits high data efficiency that only requires less than one-hour unlabeled data, and seamless generality to alternative large speech models and speech translation tasks. Our code aims to open source to the research communities.

Semantic and Spatial Adaptive Pixel-level Classifier for Semantic Segmentation
Vanilla pixel-level classifiers for semantic segmentation are based on a certain paradigm, involving the inner product of fixed prototypes obtained from the training set and pixel features in the test image.  This approach, however, encounters significant limitations, i.e., feature deviation in the semantic domain and information loss in the spatial domain. The former struggles with large intra-class variance among pixel features from different images, while the latter fails to utilize the structured information of semantic objects effectively.  This leads to blurred mask boundaries as well as a deficiency of fine-grained recognition capability.  In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic and Spatial Adaptive (SSA) classifier to address the above challenges.  Specifically, we employ the coarse masks obtained from the fixed prototypes as a guide to adjust the fixed prototype towards the center of the semantic and spatial domains in the test image.  The adapted prototypes in semantic and spatial domains are then simultaneously considered to accomplish classification decisions.  In addition, we propose an online multi-domain distillation learning strategy to improve the adaption process.  Experimental results on three publicly available benchmarks show that the proposed SSA significantly improves the segmentation performance of the baseline models with only a minimal increase in computational cost. Code is available at the supplementary material.

Semantic Feature Learning for Universal Unsupervised Cross-Domain Retrieval
Cross-domain retrieval (CDR) is finding increasingly broad applications across various domains. However, existing efforts have several major limitations, with the most critical being their reliance on accurate supervision. Recent studies thus focus on achieving unsupervised CDR, but they typically assume that the category spaces across domains are identical, an assumption that is often unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This is because only through dedicated and comprehensive analysis can the category composition of a data domain be obtained, which contradicts the premise of unsupervised scenarios. Therefore, in this work, we introduce the problem of **U**niversal **U**nsupervised **C**ross-**D**omain **R**etrieval (U^2CDR) for the first time and design a two-stage semantic feature learning framework to address it. In the first stage, a cross-domain unified prototypical structure is established under the guidance of an instance-prototype-mixed contrastive loss and a semantic-enhanced loss, to counteract category space differences. In the second stage, through a modified adversarial training mechanism, we ensure minimal changes for the established prototypical structure during domain alignment, enabling more accurate nearest-neighbor searching. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and scenarios, including close-set, partial, and open-set CDR, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art CDR methods and other related methods in solving U^2CDR challenges.

Semantic Routing via Autoregressive Modeling
We study learning-based approaches to semantic route planning, which concerns producing routes in response to rich queries that specify various criteria and preferences. Semantic routing is already widely found in industry applications, especially navigational services like Google Maps; however, existing implementations only support limited route criteria and narrow query sets as they rely on repurposing classical route optimization algorithms. We argue for a learning-based approach to semantic routing as a more scalable and general alternative. To foster interest in this important application of graph learning, we are releasing a large-scale publicly-licensed benchmark for semantic routing consisting of real-world multi-objective navigation problems---expressed via natural language queries---on the richly annotated road networks of US cities. In addition to being intractable with existing approaches to semantic routing, our benchmark poses a significant scaling challenge for graph learning methods. As a proof-of-concept, we show that---at scale---even a standard transformer network is a powerful semantic routing system and achieves non-trivial performance on our benchmark. In the process, we demonstrate a simple solution to the challenge of scaling up graph learning: an autoregressive approach that decomposes semantic routing into smaller ``next-edge'' prediction problems.

Semantics and Spatiality of Emergent Communication
When artificial agents are jointly trained to perform collaborative tasks using a communication channel, they develop opaque goal-oriented communication protocols. Good task performance is often considered sufficient evidence that meaningful communication is taking place, but existing empirical results show that communication strategies induced by common objectives can be counterintuitive whilst solving the task nearly perfectly. In this work, we identify a goal-agnostic prerequisite to meaningful communication, which we term semantic consistency, based on the idea that messages should have similar meanings across instances. We provide a formal definition for this idea, and use it to compare the two most common objectives in the field of emergent communication: discrimination and reconstruction. We prove, under mild assumptions, that semantically inconsistent communication protocols can be optimal solutions to the discrimination task, but not to reconstruction. We further show that the reconstruction objective encourages a stricter property, spatial meaningfulness, which also accounts for the distance between messages. Experiments with emergent communication games validate our theoretical results. These findings demonstrate an inherent advantage of distance-based communication goals, and contextualize previous empirical discoveries.

SemFlow: Binding Semantic Segmentation and Image Synthesis via Rectified Flow
Semantic segmentation and semantic image synthesis are two representative tasks in visual perception and generation. While existing methods consider them as two distinct tasks, we propose a unified diffusion-based framework (SemFlow) and model them as a pair of reverse problems. Specifically, motivated by rectified flow theory, we train an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to transport between the distributions of real images and semantic masks. As the training object is symmetric, samples belonging to the two distributions, images and semantic masks, can be effortlessly transferred reversibly. For semantic segmentation, our approach solves the contradiction between the randomness of diffusion outputs and the uniqueness of segmentation results. For image synthesis, we propose a finite perturbation approach to enhance the diversity of generated results without changing the semantic categories. Experiments show that our SemFlow achieves competitive results on semantic segmentation and semantic image synthesis tasks. We hope this simple framework will motivate people to rethink the unification of low-level and high-level vision. Code will be made available.

Semidefinite Relaxations of the Gromov-Wasserstein Distance
The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance is an extension of the optimal transport problem that allows one to match objects between incomparable spaces.  At its core, the GW distance is specified as the solution of a non-convex quadratic program and is not known to be tractable to solve.  In particular, existing solvers for the GW distance are only able to find locally optimal solutions.  In this work, we propose a semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation of the GW distance. The relaxation can be viewed as the Lagrangian dual of the GW distance augmented with constraints that relate the linear and quadratic terms of transportation plans. In particular, our relaxation provides a tractable (polynomial-time) algorithm to compute globally optimal transportation plans (in some instances) together with an accompanying proof of global optimality.  Our numerical experiments suggest that the proposed relaxation is strong in that it frequently computes the globally optimal solution.  Finally, we propose a numerical algorithm that allows us to compute approximately optimal transportation plans for larger datasets.

Semi-Random Matrix Completion via Flow-Based Adaptive Reweighting
We consider the well-studied problem of completing a rank-$r$, $\mu$-incoherent matrix $\mathbf{M} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ from incomplete observations. We focus on this problem in the semi-random setting where each entry is independently revealed with probability at least $p = \frac{\textup{poly}(r, \mu, \log d)}{d}$. Whereas multiple nearly-linear time algorithms have been established in the more specialized fully-random setting where each entry is revealed with probablity exactly $p$, the only known nearly-linear time algorithm in the semi-random setting is due to [CG18], whose sample complexity has a polynomial dependence on the inverse accuracy and condition number and thus cannot achieve high-accuracy recovery. Our main result is the first high-accuracy nearly-linear time algorithm for solving semi-random matrix completion, and an extension to the noisy observation setting.Our result builds upon the recent short-flat decomposition framework of [KLLST23a, KLLST23b] and leverages fast algorithms for flow problems on graphs to solve adaptive reweighting subproblems efficiently.

Semi-supervised Knowledge Transfer Across Multi-omic Single-cell Data
Knowledge transfer between multi-omic single-cell data aims to effectively transfer cell types from scRNA-seq data to unannotated scATAC-seq data. Several approaches aim to reduce the heterogeneity of multi-omic data while maintaining the discriminability of cell types with extensive annotated data. However, in reality, the cost of collecting both a large amount of labeled scRNA-seq data and scATAC-seq data is expensive. Therefore, this paper explores a practical yet underexplored problem of knowledge transfer across multi-omic single-cell data under cell type scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a semi-supervised knowledge transfer framework named Dual label scArcity elimiNation with Cross-omic multi-samplE Mixup (DANCE). To overcome the label scarcity in scRNA-seq data, we generate pseudo-labels based on optimal transport and merge them into the labeled scRNA-seq data. Moreover, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy which divides the scATAC-seq data into source-like and target-specific data. For source-like samples, we employ consistency regularization with random perturbations while for target-specific samples, we select a few candidate labels and progressively eliminate incorrect cell types from the label set for additional supervision. Next, we generate virtual scRNA-seq samples with multi-sample Mixup based on the class-wise similarity to reduce cell heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on many benchmark datasets suggest the superiority of our DANCE over a series of state-of-the-art methods.

Semi-supervised Multi-label Learning with Balanced Binary Angular Margin Loss
Semi-supervised multi-label learning (SSMLL) refers to inducing classifiers using a small number of samples with multiple labels and many unlabeled samples. The prevalent solution of SSMLL involves forming pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples and inducing classifiers using both labeled and pseudo-labeled samples in a self-training manner. Unfortunately, with the commonly used binary type of loss and negative sampling, we have empirically found that learning with labeled and pseudo-labeled samples can result in the variance bias problem between the feature distributions of positive and negative samples for each label. To alleviate this problem, we aim to balance the variance bias between positive and negative samples from the perspective of the feature angle distribution for each label. Specifically, we extend the traditional binary angular margin loss to a balanced extension with feature angle distribution transformations under the Gaussian assumption, where the distributions are iteratively updated during classifier training. We also suggest an efficient prototype-based negative sampling method to maintain high-quality negative samples for each label. With this insight, we propose a novel SSMLL method, namely Semi-Supervised Multi-Label Learning with Balanced Binary Angular Margin loss (S$^2$ML$^2$-BBAM). To evaluate the effectiveness of S$^2$ML$^2$-BBAM, we compare it with existing competitors on benchmark datasets. The experimental results validate that S$^2$ML$^2$-BBAM can achieve very competitive performance.

Semi-Truths: A Large-Scale Dataset for Testing Robustness of AI-Generated Image Detectors
While text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated impactful applications in art, design, and entertainment, these technologies also facilitate the spread of misinformation. Recent efforts have developed AI-generated image detectors claiming robustness against various augmentations, but their effectiveness remains unclear. Can these systems detect varying degrees of augmentation? Do they exhibit biases towards specific scenes or data distributions? To address these questions, we introduce Semi-Truths, featuring 27,635 real images, 245,360 masks, and 850,226 AI-augmented images featuring varying degrees of targeted and localized edits, created using diverse augmentation methods, diffusion models, and data distributions. Each augmented image includes detailed metadata for standardized, targeted evaluation of detector robustness. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art detectors are sensitive to different degrees of edits, data distributions, and editing techniques, providing deeper insights into their functionality.

Separate and Reconstruct: Asymmetric Encoder-Decoder for Speech Separation
Since the recent success of a time-domain speech separation, further improvements have been made by expanding the length and channel of a feature sequence to increase the amount of computation. When temporally expanded to a long sequence, the feature is segmented into chunks as a dual-path model in most studies of speech separation. In particular, it is common for the process of separating features corresponding to each speaker to be located in the final stage of the network. However, it is more advantageous and intuitive to proactively expand the feature sequence to include the number of speakers as an extra dimension. In this paper, we present an asymmetric strategy in which the encoder and decoder are partitioned to perform distinct processing in separation tasks. The encoder analyzes features, and the output of the encoder is split into the number of speakers to be separated. The separated sequences are then reconstructed by the weight-shared decoder, as Siamese network, in addition to cross-speaker processing. By using the Siamese network in the decoder, without using speaker information, the network directly learns to discriminate the features using a separation objective. With a common split layer, intermediate encoder features for skip connections are also split for the reconstruction decoder based on the U-Net structure. In addition, instead of segmenting the feature sequence into chunks and processing as dual-path, we design global and local Transformer blocks to directly process long sequences. The experimental results demonstrated that this separation-and-reconstruction framework is effective and that the combination of proposed global and local Transformer can sufficiently replace the role of inter- and intra-chunk processing in dual-path structure. Finally, the presented model including both of these achieved state-of-the-art performance with much less computation than before in various benchmark datasets.

Separation and Bias of Deep Equilibrium Models on Expressivity and Learning Dynamics
The deep equilibrium model (DEQ) generalizes the conventional feedforward neural network by fixing the same weights for each layer block and extending the number of layers to infinity. This novel model directly finds the fixed points of such a forward process as features for prediction.  Despite empirical evidence showcasing its efficacy compared to feedforward neural networks, a theoretical understanding for its separation and bias is still limited.  In this paper, we take a stepby proposing some separations and studying the bias of DEQ in its expressive power and learning dynamics.   The results include: (1) A general separation is proposed, showing the existence of a width-$m$ DEQ that any fully connected neural networks (FNNs) with depth $O(m^{\alpha})$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ cannotapproximate unless its width is sub-exponential in $m$; (2) DEQ with polynomially bounded size and magnitude can efficiently approximate certain steep functions (which has very large derivatives) in $L^{\infty}$ norm, whereas FNN with bounded depth and exponentially bounded width cannot unless its weights magnitudes are exponentially large; (3) The implicit regularization caused by gradient flow from a diagonal linear DEQ is characterized, with specific examples showing the benefits brought by such regularization. From the overall study, a high-level conjecture from our analysis and empirical validations is that DEQ has potential advantages in learning certain high-frequency components.

Separations in the Representational Capabilities of Transformers and Recurrent Architectures
Transformer architectures have been widely adopted in foundation models. Due to their high inference costs, there is renewed interest in exploring the potential of efficient recurrent architectures (RNNs). In this paper, we analyze the differences in the representational capabilities of Transformers and RNNs across several tasks of practical relevance, including index lookup, nearest neighbor, recognizing bounded Dyck languages, and string equality.  For the tasks considered, our results show separations based on the size of the model required for different architectures. For example, we show that a one-layer Transformer of logarithmic width can perform index lookup, whereas an RNN requires a hidden state of linear size.  Conversely, while constant-size RNNs can recognize bounded Dyck languages, we show that one-layer Transformers require a linear size for this task. Furthermore, we show that two-layer Transformers of logarithmic size can perform decision tasks such as string equality or disjointness, whereas both one-layer Transformers and recurrent models require linear size for these tasks. We also show that a log-size two-layer Transformer can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm in its forward pass; on the other hand recurrent models require linear size. Our constructions are based on the existence of $N$ nearly orthogonal vectors in $O(\log N)$ dimensional space and our lower bounds are based on reductions from communication complexity problems.  We supplement our theoretical results with experiments that highlight the differences in the performance of these architectures on practical-size sequences.

Sequence-Augmented SE(3)-Flow Matching For Conditional Protein Generation
Proteins are essential for almost all biological processes and derive their diverse functions from complex $3 \rm D$ structures, which are in turn determined by their amino acid sequences. In this paper, we exploit the rich biological inductive bias of amino acid sequences and introduce FoldFlow++, a novel sequence-conditioned $\text{SE}(3)$-equivariant flow matching model for protein structure generation. FoldFlow++ presents substantial new architectural features over the previous FoldFlow family of models including a protein large language model to encode sequence, a new multi-modal fusion trunk that combines structure and sequence representations, and a geometric transformer based decoder. To increase diversity and novelty of generated samples -- crucial for de-novo drug design -- wetrain FoldFlow++ at scale on a new dataset that is an order of magnitude larger than PDB datasets of prior works, containing both known proteins in PDB and high-quality synthetic structures achieved through filtering. We further demonstrate the ability to align FoldFlow++ to arbitrary rewards, e.g. increasing secondary structures diversity, by introducing a Reinforced Finetuning (ReFT) objective. We empirically observe that FoldFlow++ outperforms previous state-of-the-art protein structure-based generative models, improving over RFDiffusion in terms of unconditional generation across all metrics including designability, diversity, and novelty across all protein lengths, as well as exhibiting generalization on the task of equilibrium conformation sampling. Finally, we demonstrate that a fine-tuned FoldFlow++ makes progress on challenging conditional design tasks such as designing scaffolds for the VHH nanobody.

Sequential Signal Mixing Aggregation for Message Passing Graph Neural Networks
Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPGNNs) have emerged as the preferred method for modeling complex interactions across diverse graph entities. While the theory of such models is well understood, their aggregation module has not received sufficient attention. Sum-based aggregators have solid theoretical foundations regarding their separation capabilities. However, practitioners often prefer using more complex aggregations and mixtures of diverse aggregations. In this work, we unveil a possible explanation for this gap. We claim that sum-based aggregators fail to "mix" features belonging to distinct neighbors, preventing them from succeeding at downstream tasks.To this end, we introduce \aggname (\aggnameabbrv), a novel plug-and-play aggregation for MPGNNs. \aggnameabbrv treats the neighbor features as 2D discrete signals and sequentially convolves them, inherently enhancing the ability to mix features attributed to distinct neighbors. By performing extensive experiments, we show that when combining \aggnameabbrv with well-established MPGNN architectures, we achieve substantial performance gains across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results in many settings.We published our code at \githubrepo

Set-based Neural Network Encoding Without Weight Tying
We propose a neural network weight encoding method for network property prediction that utilizes set-to-set and set-to-vector functionsto efficiently encode neural network parameters. Our approach is capable of encoding neural networks in a modelzoo of mixed architecture and different parameter sizes as opposed to previous approaches that require custom encoding models for different architectures. Furthermore, our \textbf{S}et-based \textbf{N}eural network \textbf{E}ncoder (SNE) takes into consideration the hierarchical computational structure of neural networks by utilizing a layer-wise encoding scheme that culminates to encoding all layer-wise encodings to obtain the neural network encoding vector. To respect symmetries inherent in network weight space, we utilize Logit Invariance to learn the required minimal invariance properties. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{pad-chunk-encode}pipeline to efficiently encode neural network layers that is adjustable to computational and memory constraints. We also introduce two new tasks for neural network property prediction: cross-dataset and cross-architecture. In cross-dataset property prediction, we evaluate how well property predictors generalize across modelzoos trained on different datasets but of the same architecture. In cross-architecture property prediction, we evaluate how well property predictors transfer to modelzoos of different architecture not seen during training.We show that SNE outperforms the relevant baselines on standard benchmarks.

SfPUEL: Shape from Polarization under Unknown Environment Light
Shape from polarization (SfP) benefits from advancements like polarization cameras for single-shot normal estimation, but its performance heavily relies on light conditions. This paper proposes SfPUEL, an end-to-end SfP method to jointly estimate surface normal and material under unknown environment light. To handle this challenging light condition, we design a transformer-based framework for enhancing the perception of global context features. We further propose to integrate photometric stereo (PS) priors from pretrained models to enrich extracted features for high-quality normal predictions. As metallic and dielectric materials exhibit different BRDFs, SfPUEL additionally predicts dielectric and metallic material segmentation to further boost performance. Experimental results on synthetic and our collected real-world dataset demonstrate that SfPUEL significantly outperforms existing SfP and single-shot normal estimation methods. The code and dataset is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SfPUEL-E243.

Shaping the distribution of neural responses with interneurons in a recurrent circuit model
Efficient coding theory posits that sensory circuits transform natural signals into neural representations that maximize information transmission subject to resource constraints. Local interneurons are thought to play an important role in these transformations, shaping patterns of circuit activity to facilitate and direct information flow. However, the relationship between these coordinated, nonlinear, circuit-level transformations and the properties of interneurons (e.g., connectivity, activation functions) remains unknown. Here, we propose a normative computational model that establishes such a relationship. Our model is derived from an optimal transport objective that conceptualizes the circuit's input-response function as transforming the inputs to achieve a target response distribution. The circuit, which is comprised of primary neurons that are recurrently connected to a set of local interneurons, continuously optimizes this objective by dynamically adjusting both the synaptic connections between neurons as well as the interneuron activation functions. In an application motivated by redundancy reduction theory, we demonstrate that when the inputs are natural image statistics and the target distribution is a spherical Gaussian, the circuit learns a nonlinear transformation that significantly reduces statistical dependencies in neural responses. Overall, our results provide a framework in which the distribution of circuit responses is systematically and nonlinearly controlled by adjustment of interneuron connectivity and activation functions.

Shared Autonomy with IDA: Interventional Diffusion Assistance
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has unearthed the potential to assist humans in controlling advanced technologies. Shared autonomy (SA) facilitates control by combining inputs from a human pilot and an AI copilot. In prior SA studies, the copilot is constantly active in determining the action played at each time step. This limits human autonomy that may have deleterious effects on performance. In general, the amount of helpful copilot assistance varies greatly depending on the task dynamics. We therefore hypothesized that human autonomy and SA performance improves through dynamic and selective copilot intervention. To address this, we develop a goal-agnostic intervention assistance (IA) that dynamically shares control by having the copilot intervene only when the expected value of the copilot’s action exceeds that of the human’s action. We implement IA with a diffusion copilot (termed IDA) trained on expert demonstrations with goal masking. We prove that IDA performance is lower bounded by human performance, so that IDA does not negatively impact human control. In experiments with simulated human pilots, we show that IDA achieves higher performance than both pilot-only and traditional SA control in variants of the Reacher environment and Lunar Lander. We then demonstrate with human-in the-loop experiments that IDA achieves better control in Lunar Lander and that human participants experience greater autonomy and prefer IDA over pilot-only and traditional SA control. We attribute the success of IDA to preserving human autonomy while simultaneously offering assistance to prevent the human from entering universally bad states.

Sharpness-Aware Minimization Activated Interactive Teaching Understanding and Optimization
Teaching is a potentially effective approach for understanding interactions among multiple intelligences. Previous explorations have  convincingly shown that teaching presents additional opportunities for observation and demonstration within the learning model, such as data distillation and selection. However, the underlying optimization principles and convergence of interactive teaching lack theoretical analysis. In this regard, co-teaching serves as a notable prototype. In this paper, we discuss its role as a reduction of the larger loss landscape derived from Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). Then, we classify co-teaching as an iterative parameter estimation method using Expectation-Maximization (EM). The convergence of co-teaching is achieved by continuously optimizing a variational lower bound on the log marginal likelihood. This lower bound represents the expected value of the log posterior distribution of the latent variables under a scaled, factorized variational distribution. To further enhance interactive generalization performance, we incorporate SAM's strong generalization capabilities into co-teaching. This integration can be viewed as a novel sequential optimization problem. Finally, we validate the performance of our approach through multiple experiments.

Sharpness-diversity tradeoff: improving flat ensembles with SharpBalance
Recent studies on deep ensembles have identified the sharpness of the local minima of individual learners and the diversity of the ensemble members as key factors in improving test-time performance. Building on this, our study investigates the interplay between sharpness and diversity within deep ensembles, illustrating their crucial role in robust generalization to both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We discover a trade-off between sharpness and diversity: minimizing the sharpness in the loss landscape tends to diminish the diversity of individual members within the ensemble, adversely affecting the ensemble's improvement. The trade-off is justified through our rigorous theoretical analysis and verified empirically through extensive experiments. To address the issue of reduced diversity, we introduce SharpBalance, a novel training approach that balances sharpness and diversity within ensembles. Theoretically, we show that our training strategy achieves a better sharpness-diversity trade-off. Empirically, we conducted comprehensive evaluations in various data sets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet) and showed that SharpBalance not only effectively improves the sharpness-diversity trade-off but also significantly improves ensemble performance in ID and OOD scenarios.

Shaving Weights with Occam's Razor: Bayesian Sparsification for Neural Networks using the Marginal Likelihood
Neural network sparsification is a promising avenue to save computational time and memory costs, especially in an age where many successful AI models are becoming too large to naively deploy on consumer hardware. While much work has focused on different weight pruning criteria, the overall sparsifiability of the network, i.e., its capacity to be pruned without quality loss, has often been overlooked. We present Sparsifiability via the Marginal likelihood (SpaM), a sparsification framework that highlights the effectiveness of using the Bayesian marginal likelihood in conjunction with sparsity-inducing priors for making neural networks more sparsifiable. Our approach implements an automatic Occam's razor that selects the most sparsifiable model that still explains the data well, both for structured and unstructured sparsification. In addition, we demonstrate that the pre-computed posterior precision from the Laplace approximation can be re-used to define a cheap pruning criterion, which outperforms many existing (more expensive) approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, especially at high sparsity levels, across a range of different neural network architectures and datasets.

SHMT: Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup Transfer via Latent Diffusion Models
This paper studies the challenging task of makeup transfer, which aims to apply diverse makeup styles precisely and naturally to a given facial image.  Due to the absence of paired data, current methods typically synthesize sub-optimal pseudo ground truths to guide the model training, resulting in low makeup fidelity. Additionally, different makeup styles generally have varying effects on the person face, but existing methods struggle to deal with this diversity. To address these issues, we propose a novel Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup Transfer (SHMT) method via latent diffusion models. Following a "decoupling-and-reconstruction" paradigm, SHMT works in a self-supervised manner, freeing itself from the misguidance of imprecise pseudo-paired data. Furthermore, to accommodate a variety of makeup styles, hierarchical texture details are decomposed via a Laplacian pyramid and selectively introduced to the content representation. Finally, we design a novel Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module that dynamically adjusts the injection condition of the diffusion model, allowing the alignment errors caused by the domain gap between content and makeup representations to be corrected. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Should We Really Edit Language Models? On the Evaluation of Edited Language Models
Model editing has become an increasingly popular alternative for efficiently updating knowledge within language models. Current methods mainly focus on reliability, generalization, and locality,  with many methods excelling across these criteria. Some recent works disclose the pitfalls of these editing methods such as knowledge distortion or conflict. However, the general abilities of post-edited language models remain unexplored. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive evaluation on various editing methods and different language models, and have following findings.(1) Existing editing methods lead to inevitable performance deterioration on general benchmarks, indicating that existing editing methods maintain the general abilities of the model within only a few dozen edits.When the number of edits is slightly large, the intrinsic knowledge structure of the model is disrupted or even completely damaged. (2) Instruction-tuned models are more robust to editing, showing less performance drop on general knowledge after editing. (3) Language model with large scale is more resistant to editing compared to small model.(4) The safety of the edited model, is significantly weakened, even for those safety-aligned models.Our findings indicate that current editing methods are only suitable for small-scale knowledge updates within language models, which motivates further research on more practical and reliable editing methods.

Similarity-Navigated Conformal Prediction for Graph Neural Networks
Graph Neural Networks have achieved remarkable accuracy in semi-supervised node classification tasks. However, these results lack reliable uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction methods provide a theoretical guarantee for node classification tasks, ensuring that the conformal prediction set contains the ground-truth label with a desired probability (e.g., 95\%). In this paper, we empirically show that for each node, aggregating the non-conformity scores of nodes with the same label can improve the efficiency of conformal prediction sets. This observation motivates us to propose a novel algorithm named $\textit{Similarity-Navigated Adaptive Prediction Sets}$ (SNAPS), which aggregates the non-conformity scores based on feature similarity and structural neighborhood. The key idea behind SNAPS is that nodes with high feature similarity or direct connections tend to have the same label. By incorporating adaptive similar nodes information, SNAPS can generate compact prediction sets and increase the singleton hit ratio (correct prediction sets of size one). Moreover, we theoretically provide a finite-sample coverage guarantee of SNAPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SNAPS, improving the efficiency of prediction sets and singleton hit ratio while maintaining valid coverage.

Simple and Effective Masked Diffusion Language Models
While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, prior work reports a significant performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive (AR) methods on language modeling. In this work, we show that simple masked discrete diffusion is more performant than previously thought.We apply an effective training recipe that improves the performance of masked diffusion models and derive a simplified, Rao-Blackwellized objective that results in additional improvements. Our objective has a simple form---it is a mixture of classical masked language modeling losses---and can be used to train encoder-only language models that admit efficient samplers, including ones that can generate arbitrary lengths of text semi-autoregressively like a traditional language model.On language modeling benchmarks, a range of masked diffusion models trained with modern engineering practices achieves a new state-of-the-art among diffusion models, and approaches AR perplexity.

Simple and Fast Distillation of Diffusion Models
Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated their powerful performance across various tasks, but this comes at a cost of the slow sampling speed. To achieve both efficient and high-quality synthesis, various distillation-based accelerated sampling methods have been developed recently. However, they generally require time-consuming fine tuning with elaborate designs to achieve satisfactory performance in a specific number of function evaluation (NFE), making them difficult to employ in practice. To address this issue, we propose **S**imple and **F**ast **D**istillation (SFD) of diffusion models, which simplifies the paradigm used in existing methods and largely shortens their fine-tuning time up to $1000\times$. We begin with a vanilla distillation-based sampling method and boost its performance to state of the art by identifying and addressing several small yet vital factors affecting the synthesis efficiency and quality. Our method can also achieve sampling with variable NFEs using a single distilled model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFD strikes a good balance between the sample quality and fine-tuning costs in few-step image generation task. For example, SFD achieves 4.53 FID (NFE=2) on CIFAR-10 with only **0.64 hours** of fine-tuning on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Simplified and Generalized Masked Diffusion for Discrete Data
Masked (or absorbing) diffusion is actively explored as an alternative to autoregressive models for generative modeling of discrete data. However, existing work in this area has been hindered by 1) unnecessarily complex model formulations and 2) unclear relationships between different perspectives, leading to suboptimal parameterization, training objectives, and ad hoc adjustments to counteract these issues. In this work, we aim to provide a simple and general framework that unlocks the full potential of masked diffusion models. We show the first theoretical result that the continuous-time variational objective of masked diffusion models is a simple weighted integral of cross-entropy losses. Our framework also enables training generalized masked diffusion models with state-dependent masking schedules. We apply our models to text and image tasks and demonstrate state-of-the-art likelihood and zero-shot transfer results for discrete diffusion models.

SimVG: A Simple Framework for Visual Grounding with Decoupled Multi-modal Fusion
Visual grounding is a common vision task that involves grounding descriptive sentences to the corresponding regions of an image.Most existing methods use independent image-text encoding and apply complex hand-crafted modules or encoder-decoder architectures for modal interaction and query reasoning. However, their performance significantly drops when dealing with complex textual expressions. This is because the former paradigm only utilizes limited downstream data to fit the multi-modal feature fusion. Therefore, it is only effective when the textual expressions are relatively simple. In contrast, given the wide diversity of textual expressions and the uniqueness of downstream training data, the existing fusion module, which extracts multimodal content from a visual-linguistic context, has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we present a simple yet robust transformer-based framework, SimVG, for visual grounding. Specifically, we decouple visual-linguistic feature fusion from downstream tasks by leveraging existing multimodal pre-trained models and incorporating additional object tokens to facilitate deep integration of downstream and pre-training tasks. Furthermore, we design a dynamic weight-balance distillation method in the multi-branch synchronous learning process to enhance the representation capability of the simpler branch. This branch only consists of a lightweight MLP, which simplifies the structure and improves reasoning speed. Experiments on six widely used VG datasets, i.e., RefCOCO/+/g, ReferIt, Flickr30K, and GRefCOCO, demonstrate the superiority of SimVG. Finally, the proposed method not only achieves improvements in efficiency and convergence speed but also attains new state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks. Codes and models will be made available soon.

Single Forward Video Generation Model
Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generating high-quality videos through iterative denoising processes. However, these models typically require multiple denoising steps for sampling, resulting in high computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel approach of single-step video generation by leveraging adversarial distillation in video diffusion models. Our method builds upon the Stable-Video-Diffusion (SVD) framework, utilizing a generative adversarial network (GAN) to distill the complex multi-step denoising process of the diffusion model into a single forward pass. The GAN is trained to mimic the final output of the diffusion model, capturing both temporal and spatial dependencies in the video data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive quality for synthesized videos with significantly reduced computational overhead (i.e., around $23\times$ speedup compared with SVD and $6\times$ speedup compared with exiting works with even better generation quality), paving the way for real-time video synthesis. We plan to release the code and pre-trained models.

Single Image Reflection Separation via Interactive Dual-Stream Transformers
Despite satisfactory results on ``easy'' cases of single image reflection separation, prior dual-stream methods still suffer from considerable performance degradation when facing complex ones, \emph{i.e.}, the transmission layer is densely entangled with the reflection having a wide distribution of spatial intensity. The main reasons come from the lack of concern on the feature correlation during interaction, and the limited receptive field. To remedy these deficiencies, this paper presents a Dual-Stream Interactive Transformer (DSIT) design. Specifically, we devise a dual-attention interactive structure that embraces a dual-stream self-attention and a layer-aware cross-attention mechanism to simultaneously capture intra-layer and inter-layer feature correlations. Meanwhile, the introduction of attention mechanisms can also mitigate the receptive field limitation. Moreover, we modulate single-stream pre-trained Transformer embeddings with dual-stream convolutional features through cross-architecture interactions to provide richer semantic priors, thereby further relieving the ill-posedness of the problem. Extensive experimental results reveal the merits of the proposed DSIT over other state-of-the-art alternatives. Our code will be open-sourced.

Single-loop Stochastic Algorithms for Difference of Max-Structured Weakly Convex Functions
In this paper, we study a class of non-smooth non-convex problems in the form of $\min_{x}[\max_{y\in\mathcal Y}\phi(x, y) - \max_{z\in\mathcal Z}\psi(x, z)]$, where both $\Phi(x) = \max_{y\in\mathcal Y}\phi(x, y)$ and $\Psi(x)=\max_{y\in\mathcal Y}\phi(x, y)$ are weakly convex functions, and $\phi(x, y), \psi(x, z)$ are strongly concave functions in terms of $y$ and $z$, respectively.  It covers two families of problems that have been studied but are missing single-loop stochastic algorithms, i.e., difference of weakly convex functions and weakly convex strongly-concave min-max problems. We propose a stochastic Moreau envelope approximate gradient method dubbed SMAG, the first single-loop algorithm for solving these problems, and provide a state-of-the-art non-asymptotic convergence rate. The key idea of the design is to compute an approximate gradient of the Moreau envelopes of $\Phi, \Psi$ using only one step of stochastic gradient update of the primal and dual variables. Empirically, we conduct experiments on positive-unlabeled (PU) learning and partial area under ROC curve (pAUC) optimization with an adversarial fairness regularizer to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

Sketched Lanczos uncertainty score: a low-memory summary of the Fisher information
Current uncertainty quantification is memory and compute expensive, which hinders practical uptake. To counter, we develop Sketched Lanczos Uncertainty (SLU): an architecture-agnostic uncertainty score that can be applied to pre-trained neural networks with minimal overhead. Importantly, the memory use of SLU only grows logarithmically with the number of model parameters. We combine Lanczos’ algorithm with dimensionality reduction techniques to compute a sketch of the leading eigenvectors of a matrix. Applying this novel algorithm to the Fisher information matrix yields a cheap and reliable uncertainty score. Empirically, SLU yields well-calibrated uncertainties, reliably detects out-of-distribution examples, and consistently outperforms existing methods in the low-memory regime.

Sketching for Distributed Deep Learning: A Sharper Analysis
The high communication cost between the server and the clients is a significant bottleneck in scaling distributed learning for modern overparameterized deep models. One popular approach to reduce this cost is linear sketching, where the sender projects the updates into a lower dimension before communication, and the receiver desketches before any subsequent computation. While sketched distributed learning is known to scale effectively in practice, existing theoretical analyses suggest that the convergence error depends on the ambient dimension -- impacting scalability. This paper aims to shed light on this apparent mismatch between theory and practice. Our main result is a tighter analysis that eliminates the dimension dependence in sketching without imposing unrealistic restrictive assumptions in the distributed learning setup. With the approximate restricted strong smoothness property of overparameterized deep models and using the second-order geometry of the loss, we present optimization results for the single-local step and $K$-local step distributed learning and subsequent bounds on communication complexity, with implications for analyzing and implementing distributed learning for overparameterized deep models.

Skill-aware Mutual Information Optimisation for Zero-shot Generalisation in Reinforcement Learning
Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) agents can struggle to operate across tasks with varying environmental features that require different optimal skills (i.e., different modes of behaviours). Using context encoders based on contrastive learning to enhance the generalisability of Meta-RL agents is now widely studied but faces challenges such as the requirement for a large sample size, also referred to as the $\log$-$K$ curse. To improve RL generalisation to different tasks, we first introduce Skill-aware Mutual Information (SaMI), an optimisation objective that aids in distinguishing context embeddings according to skills, thereby equipping RL agents with the ability to identify and execute different skills across tasks. We then propose Skill-aware Noise Contrastive Estimation (SaNCE), a $K$-sample estimator used to optimise the SaMI objective. We provide a framework for equipping an RL agent with SaNCE in practice and conduct experimental validation on modified MuJoCo and Panda-gym benchmarks. We empirically find that RL agents that learn by maximising SaMI achieve substantially improved zero-shot generalisation to unseen tasks. Additionally, the context encoder equipped with SaNCE demonstrates greater robustness to reductions in the number of available samples, thus possessing the potential to overcome the $\log$-$K$ curse.

SleeperNets: Universal Backdoor Poisoning Attacks Against Reinforcement Learning Agents
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an actively growing field that is seeing increased usage in real-world, safety-critical applications -- making it paramount to ensure the robustness of RL algorithms against adversarial attacks. In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Using insights from our theoretical analysis we develop ``SleeperNets'' as a universal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model and leverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques. We evaluate our attack in 6 environments spanning multiple domains and demonstrate significant improvements in attack success over existing methods, while preserving benign episodic return.

SLICE-100K: A Multimodal Dataset for Extrusion-based 3D Printing
G-code (Geometric code) or RS-274 is the most widely used computer numerical control (CNC) and 3D printing programming language. G-code provides machine instructions for the movement of the 3D printer, especially for the nozzle, stage, and extrusion of material for extrusion-based additive manufacturing. Currently there does not exist a large repository of curated CAD models along with their corresponding G-code files for additive manufacturing. To address this issue, we present SLICE-100K, a first-of-its-kind dataset of over 100,000 G-code files, along with their tessellated CAD model, LVIS (Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation) categories, geometric properties, and renderings. We build our dataset from triangulated meshes derived from Objaverse-XL and Thingi10K datasets. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset by finetuning GPT-2 on a subset of the dataset for G-code translation from a legacy G-code format (Sailfish) to a more modern, widely used format (Marlin). Our dataset can be downloaded here. SLICE-100K will be the first step in developing a multimodal  foundation model for digital manufacturing.

SlimSAM: 0.1% Data Makes Segment Anything Slim
Current approaches for compressing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) yield commendable results, yet necessitate extensive data to train a new network from scratch. Employing conventional pruning techniques can remarkably reduce data requirements but would suffer from a degradation in performance. To address this challenging trade-off, we introduce SlimSAM, a novel data-efficient SAM compression method that achieves superior performance with extremely less training data. The essence of SlimSAM is encapsulated in the alternate slimming framework which effectively enhances knowledge inheritance under severely limited training data availability and exceptional pruning ratio. Diverging from prior techniques, our framework progressively compresses the model by alternately pruning and distilling distinct, decoupled sub-structures. Disturbed Taylor pruning is also proposed to address the misalignment between the pruning objective and training target, thereby boosting the post-distillation after pruning. SlimSAM yields significant performance improvements while demanding over 10 times less training data than any other existing compression methods. Even when compared to the original SAM, SlimSAM achieves approaching performance while reducing parameter counts to merely 1.4% (9.1M), MACs to 0.8% (23G), and requiring only 0.1% (10k) of the SAM training data.

Small coresets via negative dependence: DPPs, linear statistics, and concentration
Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are random configurations of points with tunable negative dependence. Because sampling is tractable, DPPs are natural candidates for subsampling tasks, such as minibatch selection or coreset construction. A \emph{coreset} is a subset of a (large) training set, such that minimizing an empirical loss averaged over the coreset is a controlled replacement for the intractable minimization of the original empirical loss.Typically, the control takes the form of a guarantee that the average loss over the coreset approximates the total loss uniformly across the parameter space.Recent work has provided significant empirical support in favor of using DPPs to build randomized coresets, coupled with interesting theoretical results that are suggestive but leave some key questions unanswered.In particular, the central question of whether the cardinality of a DPP-based coreset is fundamentally smaller than one based on independent sampling remained open.In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative, demonstrating that \emph{DPPs can provably outperform independently drawn coresets}. In this vein, we contribute a conceptual understanding of coreset loss as a \emph{linear statistic} of the (random) coreset. We leverage this structural observation to connect the coresets problem to a more general problem of concentration phenomena for linear statistics of DPPs, wherein we obtain \emph{effective concentration inequalities that extend well-beyond the state-of-the-art}, encompassing general non-projection, even non-symmetric kernels. The latter have been recently shown to be of interest in machine learning beyond coresets, but come with a limited theoretical toolbox, to the extension of which our result contributes. Finally, we are also able to address the coresets problem for vector-valued objective functions, a novelty in the coresets literature.

Small steps no more: Global convergence of stochastic gradient bandits for arbitrary learning rates
We provide a new understanding of the stochastic gradient bandit algorithm by showing that it converges to a globally optimal policy almost surely using \emph{any} constant learning rate. This result demonstrates that the stochastic gradient algorithm continues to balance exploration and exploitation appropriately even in scenarios where standard smoothness and noise control assumptions break down. The proofs are based on novel findings about action sampling rates and the relationship between cumulative progress and noise, and extend the current understanding of how simple stochastic gradient methods behave in bandit settings.

SMART: Towards Pre-trained Missing-Aware Model for Patient Health Status Prediction
Electronic health record (EHR) data has emerged as a valuable resource for analyzing patient health status. However, the prevalence of missing data in EHR poses significant challenges to existing methods, leading to spurious correlations and suboptimal predictions. While various imputation techniques have been developed to address this issue, they often obsess difficult-to-interpolate details and may introduce additional noise when making clinical predictions. To tackle this problem, we propose SMART, a Self-Supervised Missing-Aware RepresenTation Learning approach for patient health status prediction, which encodes missing information via missing-aware temporal and variable attentions and learns to impute missing values through a novel self-supervised pre-training approach which reconstructs missing data representations in the latent space rather than in input space as usual. By adopting elaborated attentions and focusing on learning higher-order representations, SMART promotes better generalization and robustness to missing data. We validate the effectiveness of SMART through extensive experiments on six EHR tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Sm: enhanced localization in Multiple Instance Learning for medical imaging classification
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in medical imaging classification to reduce the labeling effort. While only bag labels are available for training, one typically seeks predictions at both bag and instance levels (classification and localization tasks, respectively). Early MIL methods treated the instances in a bag independently. Recent methods account for global and local dependencies among instances. Although they have yielded excellent results in classification, their performance in terms of localization is comparatively limited. We argue that these models have been designed to target the classification task, while implications at the instance level have not been deeply investigated. Motivated by a simple observation -- that neighboring instances are likely to have the same label -- we propose a novel, principled, and flexible mechanism to model local dependencies. It can be used alone or combined with any mechanism to model global dependencies (e.g., transformers). A thorough empirical validation shows that our module leads to state-of-the-art performance in localization while being competitive or superior in classification.

Smoke and Mirrors in Causal Downstream Tasks
Machine Learning and AI have the potential to transform data-driven scientific discovery, enabling accurate predictions for several scientific phenomena. As many scientific questions are inherently causal, this paper looks at the causal inference task of treatment effect estimation, where we assume binary effects that are recorded as high-dimensional images in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Despite being the simplest possible setting and a perfect fit for deep learning, we theoretically find that many common choices in the literature may lead to biased estimates. To test the practical impact of these considerations, we recorded the first real-world benchmark for causal inference downstream tasks on high-dimensional observations as an RCT studying how garden ants (Lasius neglectus) respond to microparticles applied onto their colony members by hygienic grooming. Comparing 6 480 models fine-tuned from state-of-the-art visual backbones, we find that the sampling and modeling choices significantly affect the accuracy of the causal estimate, and that classification accuracy is not a proxy thereof. We further validated the analysis, repeating it on a synthetically generated visual data set controlling the causal model. Our results suggest that future benchmarks should carefully consider real downstream scientific questions, especially causal ones. Further, we highlight guidelines for representation learning methods to help answer causal questions in the sciences. All code and data will be released.

S-MolSearch: 3D Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning for Bioactive Molecule Search
Virtual Screening is an essential technique in the early phases of drug discovery, aimed at identifying promising drug candidates from vast molecular libraries. Recently, ligand-based virtual screening has garnered significant attention due to its efficacy in conducting extensive database screenings without relying on specific protein-binding site information.Obtaining binding affinity data for complexes is highly expensive, resulting in a limited amount of available data that covers a relatively small chemical space. Moreover, these datasets contain a significant amount of inconsistent noise. It is challenging to identify an inductive bias that consistently maintains the integrity of molecular activity during data augmentation. To tackle these challenges, we propose S-MolSearch, the first framework to our knowledge, that leverages molecular 3D information and affinity information in semi-supervised contrastive learning for ligand-based virtual screening. % S-MolSearch processes both labeled and unlabeled data, trains molecular structural encoders, and generates soft labels for unlabeled data, drawing on the principles of inverse optimal transport.Drawing on the principles of inverse optimal transport, S-MolSearch efficiently processes both labeled and unlabeled data, training molecular structural encoders while generating soft labels for the unlabeled data.This design allows S-MolSearch to adaptively utilize unlabeled data within the learning process.Empirically, S-MolSearch demonstrates superior performance on widely-used benchmarks LIT-PCBA and DUD-E. It surpasses both structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods for enrichment factors across 0.5\%, 1\% and 5\%.

Smoothed Energy Guidance: Guiding Diffusion Models by Attenuating Energy Curvature of Attention
Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in visual content generation, producing high-quality samples across various domains. However, in the absence of text conditions, their performance in image generation has been limited due to the inapplicability of classifier-free guidance (CFG). Recent attempts to extend guidance to unconditional models have relied on heuristic approaches, resulting in unintended effects. In this work, we propose Smoothed Energy Guidance (SEG), a novel training- and condition-free approach that leverages the energy-based perspective of the self-attention mechanism to enhance image generation. By defining the energy of self-attention, we derive and introduce a method to actually reduce the curvature of the energy landscape of attention and use the output as the unconditional prediction. Contrary to previous works, we can smoothly control the curvature of the energy landscape by adjusting the Gaussian kernel parameter, with the guidance scale parameter fixed. Additionally, we present an efficient query blurring that is equivalent to blurring the entire attention map without significant computational overhead.

Smoothed Online Classification can be Harder than Batch Classification
We study online classification under smoothed adversaries. In this setting, at each time point, the adversary draws an example from a distribution that has a bounded density with respect to a fixed base measure, which is known apriori to the learner. For binary classification and scalar-valued regression, previous works [Haghtalab et al., 2020, Block et al., 2022] have shown that smoothed online learning is as easy as learning in the iid batch setting under PAC model. However, we show that smoothed online classification can be harder than the iid batch classification when the label space is unbounded. In particular, we construct a hypothesis class that is learnable in the iid batch setting under the PAC model but is not learnable under the smoothed online model. Finally, we identify a condition that ensures that the PAC learnability of a hypothesis class is sufficient for its smoothed online learnability.

Soft ascent-descent as a stable and flexible alternative to flooding
As a heuristic for improving test accuracy in classification, the "flooding" method proposed by Ishida et al. (2020) sets a threshold for the average surrogate loss at training time; above the threshold, gradient descent is run as usual, but below the threshold, a switch to gradient *ascent* is made. While setting the threshold is non-trivial and is usually done with validation data, this simple technique has proved remarkably effective in terms of accuracy. On the other hand, what if we are also interested in other metrics such as model complexity or average surrogate loss at test time? As an attempt to achieve better overall performance with less fine-tuning, we propose a softened, pointwise mechanism called SoftAD (soft ascent-descent) that downweights points on the borderline, limits the effects of outliers, and retains the ascent-descent effect of flooding, with no additional computational overhead. We contrast formal stationarity guarantees with those for flooding, and empirically demonstrate how SoftAD can realize classification accuracy competitive with flooding (and the more expensive alternative SAM) while enjoying a much smaller loss generalization gap and model norm.

Soft-Label Integration for Robust Toxicity Classification
Toxicity classification in textual content remains a significant problem. Data with labels from a single annotator fall short of capturing the diversity of human perspectives. Therefore, there is a growing need to incorporate crowdsourced annotations for training an effective toxicity classifier. Additionally, the standard approach to train a classifier with empirical risk minimization (ERM) may fail to address the potential shift between the training set and testing set due to exploiting spurious correlations. This work introduces a novel bi-level optimization framework that integrates crowdsourced annotations with the soft-labeling technique and optimizes the soft-label weights by Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GroupDRO) to enhance the robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) risk. We theoretically prove the convergence of our bi-level optimization algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of both average and worst-group accuracy, confirming its effectiveness in leveraging crowdsourced annotations to achieve more effective and robust toxicity classification.

Soft Superpixel Neighborhood Attention
Images contain objects with deformable boundaries, such as the contours of a human face, yet attention operators act on square windows. This mixes features from perceptually unrelated regions, which can degrade the quality of a denoiser. One can exclude pixels using an estimate of perceptual groupings, such as superpixels, but the naive use of superpixels can be theoretically and empirically worse than standard attention. Using superpixel probabilities rather than superpixel assignments, this paper proposes soft superpixel neighborhood attention (SNA), which interpolates between the existing neighborhood attention and the naive superpixel neighborhood attention. This paper presents theoretical results showing SNA is the optimal denoiser under a latent superpixel model. SNA outperforms alternative local attention modules on image denoising, and we compare the superpixels learned from denoising with those learned with supervision.

Soft Tensor Product Representations for Fully Continuous, Compositional Visual Representations
Since the inception of the classicalist/connectionist debate, it has been argued that the ability to systematically combine  symbol-like entities into compositional representations is necessary for much of intelligent human behaviour. The field of disentangled representation learning has emerged to address this need in connectionist systems by producing explicitly compositional, vector-valued representations. By treating the overall representation as a concatenation of the inferred factors of variation (FoVs), however, conventional disentanglement approaches provide a fundamentally symbolic, string-like treatment of compositional structure. We hypothesise that the fundamental incompatibility between such symbolic representations of compositional structure and the continuous vector spaces underlying deep learning systems produces suboptimal behaviour in both the representation learner and downstream models that use these representations. To fully align compositional structure with continuous vector spaces, we extend Smolensky's Tensor Product Representation (TPR) framework and propose a new type of inherently continuous compositional representation, the Soft TPR. We further introduce a novel, weakly supervised method of learning the representation we propose. Our framework confers demonstrable benefits for both the representation learner (state-of-the-art disentanglement and increased representation learning convergence), and downstream models (improved sample efficiency and superior low sample regime performance), offering strong support for our central hypothesis.

Solving Inverse Problems via Diffusion Optimal Control
Existing approaches to diffusion-based inverse problem solvers frame the signal recovery task as a probabilistic sampling episode, where the solution is drawn from the desired posterior distribution. This framework suffers from several critical drawbacks, including the intractability of the conditional likelihood function, strict dependence on the score network approximation, and poor $\mathbf{x}_0$ prediction quality. We demonstrate that these limitations can be sidestepped by reframing the generative process as a discrete optimal control episode. We derive a diffusion-based optimal controller inspired by the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm. This framework is fully general and able to handle any differentiable forward measurement operator, including super-resolution, inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, nonlinear deblurring, and even highly nonlinear neural classifiers. Furthermore, we show that the idealized posterior sampling equation can be recovered as a special case of our algorithm. We then evaluate our method against a selection of neural inverse problem solvers, and establish a new baseline in image reconstruction with inverse problems.

Solving Sparse \& High-Dimensional-Output Regression via Compression
Multi-Output Regression (MOR) has been widely used in scientific data analysis for decision-making. Unlike traditional regression models, MOR aims to simultaneously predict multiple real-valued outputs given an input. However, the increasing dimensionality of the outputs poses significant challenges regarding interpretability and computational scalability for modern MOR applications. As a first step to address these challenges, this paper proposes a Sparse \& High-dimensional-Output REgression (SHORE) model by incorporating additional sparsity requirements to resolve the output interpretability, and then designs a computationally efficient two-stage framework capable of handling SHORE with provable accuracy via compression on outputs. Theoretically, we show that the proposed framework is computationally scalable while maintaining the same order of training loss and prediction loss before-and-after compression under arbitrary or relatively weak sample set conditions. Empirically, numerical results further validate the theoretical findings, showcasing the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework.

Solving Zero-Sum Markov Games with Continous State via Spectral Dynamic Embedding
In this paper, we propose a provably efficient natural policy gradient algorithm called Spectral Dynamic Embedding Policy Optimization (\SDEPO) for two-player zero-sum stochastic Markov games with continuous state space and finite action space.  In the policy evaluation procedure of our algorithm, a novel kernel embedding method is employed to construct a finite-dimensional linear approximations to the state-action value function.  We explicitly analyze the approximation error in policy evaluation, and show that \SDEPO\  achieves an $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{(1-\gamma)^3\epsilon})$ last-iterate convergence to the $\epsilon-$optimal Nash equilibrium, which is independent of the cardinality of the state space.  The complexity result matches the best-known results for global convergence of policy gradient algorithms for single agent setting.  Moreover, we also propose a practical variant of \SDEPO\ to deal with continuous action space and empirical results demonstrate the practical superiority of the proposed method.

Span-Based Optimal Sample Complexity for Weakly Communicating and General Average Reward MDPs
We study the sample complexity of learning an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an average-reward Markov decision process (MDP) under a generative model. For weakly communicating MDPs, we establish the complexity bound $\widetilde{O}\left(SA\frac{\mathsf{H}}{\varepsilon^2} \right)$, where $\mathsf{H}$ is the span of the bias function of the optimal policy and $SA$ is the cardinality of the state-action space. Our result is the first that is minimax optimal (up to log factors) in all parameters $S,A,\mathsf{H}$, and $\varepsilon$, improving on existing work that either assumes uniformly bounded mixing times for all policies or has suboptimal dependence on the parameters. We also initiate the study of sample complexity in general (multichain) average-reward MDPs. We argue a new transient time parameter $\mathsf{B}$ is necessary, establish an $\widetilde{O}\left(SA\frac{\mathsf{B} + \mathsf{H}}{\varepsilon^2} \right)$ complexity bound, and prove a matching (up to log factors) minimax lower bound. Both results are based on reducing the average-reward MDP to a discounted MDP, which requires new ideas in the general setting. To optimally analyze this reduction, we develop improved bounds for $\gamma$-discounted MDPs, showing that $\widetilde{O}\left(SA\frac{\mathsf{H}}{(1-\gamma)^2\varepsilon^2} \right)$ and $\widetilde{O}\left(SA\frac{\mathsf{B} + \mathsf{H}}{(1-\gamma)^2\varepsilon^2} \right)$ samples suffice to learn $\varepsilon$-optimal policies in weakly communicating and in general MDPs, respectively. Both these results circumvent the well-known minimax lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}\left(SA\frac{1}{(1-\gamma)^3\varepsilon^2} \right)$ for $\gamma$-discounted MDPs, and establish a quadratic rather than cubic horizon dependence for a fixed MDP instance.

SPARKLE: A Unified Single-Loop Primal-Dual Framework for Decentralized Bilevel Optimization
This paper studies decentralized bilevel optimization, in which multiple agents collaborate to solve problems involving nested optimization structures with neighborhood communications. Most existing literature primarily utilizes gradient tracking to mitigate the influence of data heterogeneity, without exploring other well-known heterogeneity-correction techniques such as EXTRA or Exact Diffusion. Additionally, these studies often employ identical decentralized strategies for both upper- and lower-level problems, neglecting to leverage distinct mechanisms across different levels. To address these limitations, this paper proposes SPARKLE, a unified single-loop primal-dual algorithm framework for decentralized bilevel optimization. SPARKLE offers the flexibility to incorporate various heterogeneity-correction strategies into the algorithm. Moreover, SPARKLE allows for different strategies to solve upper- and lower-level problems. We present a unified convergence analysis for SPARKLE, applicable to all its variants, with state-of-the-art convergence rates compared to existing decentralized bilevel algorithms. Our results further reveal that EXTRA and Exact Diffusion are more suitable for decentralized bilevel optimization, and using mixed strategies in bilevel algorithms brings more benefits than relying solely on gradient tracking.

Sparse-view Pose Estimation and Reconstruction via Analysis by Generative Synthesis
Inferring the 3D structure underlying a set of multi-view images requires solving two co-dependent tasks -- accurate 3D reconstruction requires precise camera poses, and predicting camera poses relies on (implicitly or explicitly) modeling the underlying 3D. The classical framework of analysis by synthesis casts this inference as a joint optimization seeking to explain the observed pixels, and recent instantiations typically learn expressive 3D representations (e.g., Neural Fields) with gradient-descent-based pose refinement of off-the-shelf pose estimates. However, given a sparse set of observed views, the observations may not provide sufficient direct evidence to obtain complete and accurate 3D. Moreover, large errors in pose estimation may not be easily corrected and can further degrade the inferred 3D. To allow robust 3D reconstruction and pose estimation in this challenging setup, we propose a method that adapts this analysis-by-synthesis approach by: a) including novel-view-synthesis-based generative priors in conjunction with photometric objectives to improve the quality of the inferred 3D, and b) explicit reasoning about outliers and a discrete search and continuous optimization-based strategy to correct them. We validate our framework across real-world and synthetic datasets in conjunction with several off-the-shelf pose estimation systems as initialization. We find that it significantly improves the base systems' pose accuracy while yielding high-quality 3D reconstructions that outperform the results from current unposed multi-view reconstruction baselines.

Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks
Spatial Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPGNNs) are widely used for learning on graph-structured data. However, key limitations of *ℓ*-step MPGNNs are that their "receptive field" is typically limited to the *ℓ*-hop neighborhood of a node and that information exchange between distant nodes is limited by over-squashing.Motivated by these limitations, we propose *Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks (S²GNNs)* – a new modeling paradigm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that synergistically combines spatially and spectrally parametrized graph filters. Parameterizing filters partially in the frequency domain enables global yet efficient information propagation.We show that S²GNNs vanquish over-squashing and yield strictly tighter approximation-theoretic error bounds than MPGNNs. Further, rethinking graph convolutions at a fundamental level unlocks new design spaces. For example, S²GNNs allow for free positional encodings that make them strictly more expressive than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. Moreover, to obtain general-purpose S²GNNs, we propose spectrally parametrized filters for directed graphs. S²GNNs outperform spatial MPGNNs, graph transformers, and graph rewirings, e.g., on the peptide long-range benchmark tasks, and are competitive with state-of-the-art sequence modeling. On a 40 GB GPU, S²GNNs scale to millions of nodes.

Speaking Your Language: Spatial Relationships in Interpretable Emergent Communication
Effective communication requires the ability to refer to specific parts of an observation in relation to others. While emergent communication literature shows success in developing various language properties, no research has shown the emergence of such positional references. This paper demonstrates how agents can communicate about spatial relationships within their observations. The results indicate that agents can develop a language capable of expressing the relationships between parts of their observation, achieving over 90\% accuracy when trained in a referential game which requires such communication. Using a collocation measure, we demonstrate how the agents create such references. This analysis suggests that agents use a mixture of non-compositional and compositional messages to convey spatial relationships. We also show that the emergent language is interpretable by humans. The translation accuracy is tested by communicating with the receiver agent, where the receiver achieves over 78\% accuracy using parts of this lexicon, confirming that the interpretation of the emergent language was successful.

SpeAr: A Spectral Approach for Zero-Shot Node Classification
Zero-shot node classification is a vital task in the field of graph data processing, aiming to identify nodes of classes unseen during the training process. Prediction bias is one of the primary challenges in zero-shot node classification, referring to the model's propensity to misclassify nodes of unseen classes as seen classes. However, most methods introduce external knowledge to mitigate the bias, inadequately leveraging the inherent cluster information within the unlabeled nodes. To address this issue, we employ spectral analysis coupled with learnable class prototypes to discover the implicit cluster structures within the graph, providing a more comprehensive understanding of classes. In this paper, we propose a spectral approach for zero-shot node classification (SpeAr). Specifically, we establish an approximate relationship between minimizing the spectral contrastive loss and performing spectral decomposition on the graph, thereby enabling effective node characterization through loss minimization. Subsequently, the class prototypes are iteratively refined based on the learned node representations, initialized with the semantic vectors. Finally, extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the SpeAr, which can further alleviate the bias problem.

Spectral Adapter: Fine-Tuning in Spectral Space
Recent developments in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for pretrained deep neural networks have captured widespread interest. In this work, we study the enhancement of current PEFT methods by incorporating the spectral information of pretrained weight matrices into the fine-tuning procedure. We investigate two spectral adaptation mechanisms, namely additive tuning and orthogonal rotation of the top singular vectors, both are done via first carrying out Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of pretrained weights and then fine-tuning the top spectral space. We provide a theoretical analysis of spectral fine-tuning and show that our approach improves the rank capacity of low-rank adapters given a fixed trainable parameter budget. We show through extensive experiments that the proposed fine-tuning model enables better parameter efficiency and tuning performance as well as benefits multi-adapter fusion.  The source code will be open-sourced for reproducibility.

Spectral Graph Pruning Against Over-Squashing and Over-Smoothing
Message Passing Graph Neural Networks are known to suffer from two problems that are sometimes believed to be diametrically opposed: over-squashing and over-smoothing. The former results from topological bottlenecks that hamper the information flow from distant nodes and are mitigated by spectral gap maximization, primarily, by means of edge additions. However, such additions often promote over-smoothing that renders nodes of different classes less distinguishable. Inspired by the Braess phenomenon, we argue that deleting edges can address over-squashing and over-smoothing simultaneously. This insight explains how edge deletions can improve generalization, thus connecting spectral gap optimization to a seemingly disconnected objective of reducing computational resources by pruning graphs for lottery tickets. To this end, we propose a computationally effective spectral gap optimization framework to add or delete edges and demonstrate its effectiveness on the long range graph benchmark and on larger heterophilous datasets.

SpGesture: Source-Free Domain-adaptive sEMG-based Gesture Recognition with Jaccard Attentive Spiking Neural Network
Surface electromyography (sEMG) based gesture recognition offers a natural and intuitive interaction modality for wearable devices. Despite significant advancements in sEMG-based gesture-recognition models, existing methods often suffer from high computational latency and increased energy consumption. Additionally, the inherent instability of sEMG signals, combined with their sensitivity to distribution shifts in real-world settings, compromises model robustness.     To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel SpGesture framework based on Spiking Neural Networks, which possesses several unique merits compared with existing methods: (1) Robustness: By utilizing membrane potential as a memory list, we pioneer the introduction of Source-Free Domain Adaptation into SNN for the first time. This enables SpGesture to mitigate the accuracy degradation caused by distribution shifts. (2) High Accuracy: With a novel Spiking Jaccard Attention, SpGesture enhances the SNNs' ability to represent sEMG features, leading to a notable rise in system accuracy. To validate SpGesture's performance, we collected a new sEMG gesture dataset which has different forearm postures, where SpGesture achieved the highest accuracy among the baselines ($89.26\%$). Moreover, the actual deployment on the CPU demonstrated a system latency below 100ms, well within real-time requirements. This impressive performance showcases SpGesture's potential to enhance the applicability of sEMG in real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpGesture.

Spherical Frustum Sparse Convolution Network for LiDAR Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation
LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation enables the robots to obtain fine-grained semantic information of the surrounding environment. Recently, many works project the point cloud onto the 2D image and adopt the 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or vision transformer for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation. However, since more than one point can be projected onto the same 2D position but only one point can be preserved, the previous 2D projection-based segmentation methods suffer from inevitable quantized information loss, which results in incomplete geometric structure, especially for small objects. To avoid quantized information loss, in this paper, we propose a novel spherical frustum structure, which preserves all points projected onto the same 2D position. Additionally, a hash-based representation is proposed for memory-efficient spherical frustum storage. Based on the spherical frustum structure, the Spherical Frustum sparse Convolution (SFC) and Frustum Farthest Point Sampling (F2PS) are proposed to convolve and sample the points stored in spherical frustums respectively. Finally, we present the Spherical Frustum sparse Convolution Network (SFCNet) to adopt 2D CNNs for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation without quantized information loss. Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our SFCNet outperforms previous 2D projection-based semantic segmentation methods based on conventional spherical projection and shows better performance on small object segmentation by preserving complete geometric structure. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

Spike-based Neuromorphic Model for Sound Source Localization
Biological systems possess remarkable sound source localization (SSL) capabilities that are critical for survival in complex environments. This ability arises from the collaboration between the auditory periphery, which encodes sound as precisely timed spikes, and the auditory cortex, which performs spike-based computations. Inspired by these biological mechanisms, we propose a novel neuromorphic SSL model that integrates spike-based neural encoding and computation. The model employs Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons with a phase-locking coding (RF-PLC) method to achieve energy-efficient audio processing. The RF-PLC method leverages the resonance properties of RF neurons to efficiently convert audio signals to time-frequency representation and encode interaural time difference (ITD) cues into discriminative spike patterns. In addition, biological adaptations like frequency band selectivity and short-term memory enhance SSL capability in noisy environments. Inspired by these adaptations, we introduce a spike-driven multi-auditory attention (MAA) module that significantly improves both the accuracy and robustness of the proposed SSL model in real-world conditions. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy  outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, our model shows exceptional noise robustness and maintains high accuracy even at very low signal-to-noise ratios. By mimicking biological hearing, this neuromorphic approach contributes to the development of high-performance and explainable artificial intelligence systems capable of superior performance in real-world environments.

SpikedAttention: Training-Free and Fully Spike-Driven Transformer-to-SNN Conversion with Winner-Oriented Spike Shift for Softmax Operation
Event-driven spiking neural networks(SNNs) are promising neural networks that reduce the energy consumption of continuously growing AI models. Recently, keeping pace with the development of transformers, transformer-based SNNs were presented. Due to the incompatibility of self-attention with spikes, however, existing transformer-based SNNs limit themselves by either restructuring self-attention architecture or conforming to non-spike computations. In this work, we propose a novel transformer-to-SNN conversion method that outputs an end-to-end spike-based transformer, named SpikedAttention. Our method directly converts the well-trained transformer without modifying its attention architecture. For the vision task, the proposed method converts Swin Transformer into an SNN without post-training or conversion-aware training, achieving state-of-the-art SNN accuracy on ImageNet dataset, i.e., 80.0\% with 28.7M parameters. Considering weight accumulation, neuron potential update, and on-chip data movement, SpikedAttention reduces energy consumption by 42\% compared to the baseline ANN, i.e., Swin-T. Furthermore, for the first time, we demonstrate that SpikedAttention successfully converts a BERT model to an SNN with only 0.3\% accuracy loss on average consuming 58\% less energy on GLUE benchmark.

SpikeReveal: Unlocking Temporal Sequences from Real Blurry Inputs with Spike Streams
Reconstructing a sequence of sharp images from the blurry input is crucial for enhancing our insights into the captured scene and poses a significant challenge due to the limited temporal features embedded in the image. Spike cameras, sampling at rates up to 40,000 Hz, have proven effective in capturing motion features and beneficial for solving this ill-posed problem. Nonetheless, existing methods fall into the supervised learning paradigm, which suffers from notable performance degradation when applied to real-world scenarios that diverge from the synthetic training data domain.To address these challenges, we propose the first self-supervised framework for the task of spike-guided motion deblurring. Our approach begins with the formulation of a spike-guided deblurring model that explores the theoretical relationships among spike streams, blurry images, and their corresponding sharp sequences. We subsequently develop a self-supervised cascaded framework to alleviate the issues of spike noise and spatial-resolution mismatching encountered in the deblurring model.With knowledge distillation and re-blurring loss, we further design a lightweight deblur network to generate high-quality sequences with brightness and texture consistency with the original input. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on our real-world and synthetic datasets with spikes validate the superior generalization of the proposed framework.

Spiking Transformer with Experts Mixture
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide a sparse spike-driven mechanism which is believed to be critical for energy-efficient deep learning. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), on the other side, aligns with the brain mechanism of distributed and sparse processing, resulting in an efficient way of enhancing model capacity and conditional computation. In this work, we consider how to incorporate SNNs’ spike-driven and MoE’s conditional computation into a unified framework. However, MoE uses softmax to get the dense conditional weights for each expert and TopK to hard-sparsify the network, which does not fit the properties of SNNs. To address this issue, we reformulate MoE in SNNs and introduce the Spiking Experts Mixture Mechanism (SEMM) from the perspective of sparse spiking activation. Both the experts and the router output spiking sequences, and their element-wise operation makes SEMM computation spike-driven and dynamic sparse-conditional. By developing SEMM into Spiking Transformer, the Experts Mixture Spiking Attention (EMSA) and the Experts Mixture Spiking Perceptron (EMSP) are proposed, which performs routing allocation for head-wise and channel-wise spiking experts, respectively. Experiments show that SEMM realizes sparse conditional computation and obtains a stable improvement on neuromorphic and static datasets with approximate computational overhead based on the Spiking Transformer baselines.

SplitNeRF: Split Sum Approximation Neural Field for Joint Geometry, Illumination, and Material Estimation
We present a novel approach for digitizing real-world objects by estimating their geometry, material properties, and environmental lighting from a set of posed images with fixed lighting. Our method incorporates into Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) pipelines the split sum approximation used with image-based lighting for real-time physically based rendering. We propose modeling the scene's lighting with a single scene-specific MLP representing pre-integrated image-based lighting at arbitrary resolutions. We accurately model pre-integrated lighting by exploiting a novel regularizer based on efficient Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, we propose a new method of supervising self-occlusion predictions by exploiting a similar regularizer based on Monte Carlo sampling. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in estimating scene geometry, material properties, and lighting. Our method attains state-of-the-art relighting quality after only ${\sim}1$ hour of training in a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.

SPO: Sequential Monte Carlo Policy Optimisation
Leveraging planning during learning and decision-making is central to the long-term development of intelligent agents. Recent works have successfully combined tree-based search methods and self-play learning mechanisms to this end. However, these methods typically face scaling challenges due to the sequential nature of their search. While practical engineering solutions can partly overcome this, they often result in a negative impact on performance. In this paper, we introduce SPO: Sequential Monte Carlo Policy Optimisation, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm grounded within the Expectation Maximisation (EM) framework. We show that SPO provides robust policy improvement and efficient scaling properties. The sample-based search makes it directly applicable to both discrete and continuous action spaces without modifications. We demonstrate statistically significant improvements in performance relative to model-free and model-based baselines across both continuous and discrete environments. Furthermore, the parallel nature of SPO’s search enables effective utilisation of hardware accelerators, yielding favourable scaling laws.

SRFUND: A Multi-Granularity Hierarchical Structure Reconstruction Benchmark in Form Understanding
Accurately identifying and organizing textual content is crucial for the automation of document processing in the field of form understanding. Existing datasets, such as FUNSD and XFUND, support entity classification and relationship prediction tasks but are typically limited to local and entity-level annotations. This limitation overlooks the hierarchically structured representation of documents, constraining comprehensive understanding of complex forms. To address this issue, we present the SRFUND, a hierarchically structured multi-task form understanding benchmark. SRFUND provides refined annotations on top of the original FUNSD and XFUND datasets, encompassing five tasks: (1) word to text-line merging, (2) text-line to entity merging, (3) entity category classification, (4) item table localization, and (5) entity-based full-document hierarchical structure recovery. We meticulously supplemented the original dataset with missing annotations at various levels of granularity and added detailed annotations for multi-item table regions within the forms. Additionally, we introduce global hierarchical structure dependencies for entity relation prediction tasks, surpassing traditional local key-value associations. The SRFUND dataset includes eight languages including English, Chinese, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, making it a powerful tool for cross-lingual form understanding. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the SRFUND dataset presents new challenges and significant opportunities in handling diverse layouts and global hierarchical structures of forms, thus providing deep insights into the field of form understanding. The original dataset and implementations of baseline methods are available at https://sprateam-ustc.github.io/SRFUND.

SSDiff: Spatial-spectral Integrated Diffusion Model for Remote Sensing Pansharpening
Pansharpening is a significant image fusion technique that merges the spatial content and spectral characteristics of remote sensing images to generate high-resolution multispectral images. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have been gradually applied to visual tasks, enhancing controllable image generation through low-rank adaptation (LoRA). In this paper, we introduce a spatial-spectral integrated diffusion model for the remote sensing pansharpening task, called SSDiff, which considers the pansharpening process as the fusion process of spatial and spectral components from the perspective of subspace decomposition. Specifically, SSDiff utilizes spatial and spectral branches to learn spatial details and spectral features separately, then employs a designed alternating projection fusion module (APFM) to accomplish the fusion. Furthermore, we propose a frequency modulation inter-branch module (FMIM) to modulate the frequency distribution between branches. The two components of SSDiff can perform favorably against the APFM when utilizing a LoRA-like branch-wise alternative fine-tuning method. It refines SSDiff to capture component-discriminating features more sufficiently. Finally, extensive experiments on four commonly used datasets, i.e., WorldView-3, WorldView-2, GaoFen-2, and QuickBird, demonstrate the superiority of SSDiff both visually and quantitatively. The code will be made open source after possible acceptance.

ST$_k$: A Scalable Module for Solving Top-k problems
The cost of ranking becomes significant in the new stage of deep learning. We propose ST$_k$, a fully differentiable module with a single trainable parameter, designed to solve the Top-k problem without requiring additional time or GPU memory. Due to its fully differentiable nature, ST$_k$ can be embeded end-to-end into neural networks and optimize the Top-k problems within a unified computational graph.We apply ST$_k$ to the Average Top-k Loss (AT$_k$), which inherently faces a Top-k problem. The proposed ST$_k$ Loss outperforms AT$_k$ Loss and achieves the best average performance on multiple benchmarks, with lowest standard deviation. With the assistance of ST$_k$ Loss, we surpass the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on both CIFAR-100-LT and Places-LT leaderboards.

Stability and Generalization of Adversarial Training for Shallow Neural Networks with Smooth Activation
Adversarial training has emerged as a popular approach for training models that are robust to inference-time adversarial attacks. However, our theoretical understanding of why and when it works remains limited. Prior work has offered generalization analysis of adversarial training, but they are either restricted to the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime or they make restrictive assumptions about data such as (noisy) linear separability or robust realizability. In this work, we study the stability and generalization of adversarial training for two-layer networks **without any data distribution assumptions** and **beyond the NTK regime**. Our findings suggest that for networks with *any given initialization* and *sufficiently large width*, the generalization bound can be effectively controlled via early stopping. We further improve the generalization bound by leveraging smoothing using Moreau’s envelope.

Stabilize the Latent Space for Image Autoregressive Modeling: A Unified Perspective
Latent-based image generative models, such as Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) and Mask Image Models (MIMs), have achieved notable success in image generation tasks. These models typically leverage reconstructive autoencoders like VQGAN or VAE to encode pixels into a more compact latent space and learn the data distribution in the latent space instead of directly from pixels. However, this practice raises a pertinent question: Is it truly the optimal choice? In response, we begin with an intriguing observation: despite sharing the same latent space, autoregressive models significantly lag behind LDMs and MIMs in image generation. This finding contrasts sharply with the field of NLP, where the autoregressive model GPT has established a commanding presence. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a unified perspective on the relationship between latent space and generative models, emphasizing the stability of latent space in image generative modeling. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective discrete image tokenizer to stabilize the latent space for image generative modeling. Experimental results show that image autoregressive modeling with our tokenizer (DiGIT) benefits both image understanding and image generation with the next token prediction principle, which is inherently straightforward for GPT models but challenging for other generative models. Remarkably, for the first time, a GPT-style autoregressive model for images outperforms LDMs, which also exhibits substantial improvement akin to GPT when scaling up model size. Our findings underscore the potential of an optimized latent space and the integration of discrete tokenization in advancing the capabilities of image generative models.

Stabilizing Linear Passive-Aggressive Online Learning with Weighted Reservoir Sampling
Online learning methods, like the seminal Passive-Aggressive (PA) classifier, are still highly effective for high-dimensional streaming data, out-of-core processing, and other throughput-sensitive applications. Many such algorithms rely on fast adaption to individual errors as a key to their convergence. While such algorithms enjoy low theoretical risk bounds, in real-world deployment they can be sensitive to individual outliers that cause the algorithm to over-correct. When such outliers occur at the end of the data stream, this can cause the final solution to have unexpectedly low accuracy. We design a weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) approach to remedy this risk without requiring additional passes over the data, hold-out sets, or a constant factor of additional memory. Our key insight is that good solutions tend to be error-free for more iterations than bad solutions, and thus, the number of passive rounds provides an estimate of a solution's relative quality. Our reservoir thus contains $K$ previous intermediate weight vectors that are of an (expected) high accuracy. We demonstrate our WRS approach on the Passive-Aggressive Classifier (PAC) and First-Order Sparse Online Learning (FSOL), where our method consistently and significantly outperforms the unmodified approach.

Stabilizing Zero-Shot Prediction: A Novel Antidote to Forgetting in Continual Vision-Language Tasks
Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language (VL) models to efficiently adapt to a sequence of downstream tasks. However, these models often encounter challenges in retaining previously acquired skills due to parameter shifts and limited access to historical data. In response, recent efforts focus on devising specific frameworks and various replay strategies, striving for a typical learning-forgetting trade-off. Surprisingly, both our empirical research and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the stability of the model in consecutive zero-shot predictions serves as a reliable indicator of its anti-forgetting capabilities for previously learned tasks. Motivated by these insights, we develop a novel replay-free CL method named ZAF (Zero-shot Antidote to Forgetting), which preserves acquired knowledge through a zero-shot stability regularization applied to wild data in a plug-and-play manner. To enhance efficiency in adapting to new tasks and seamlessly access historical models, we introduce a parameter-efficient EMA-LoRA neural architecture based on the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). ZAF utilizes new data for low-rank adaptation (LoRA), complemented by a zero-shot antidote on wild data, effectively decoupling learning from forgetting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate ZAF's superior performance and robustness in pre-trained models across various continual VL concept learning tasks, achieving leads of up to 3.70\%, 4.82\%, and 4.38\%, along with at least a 10x acceleration in training speed on three benchmarks, respectively. Additionally, our zero-shot antidote significantly reduces forgetting in existing models by at least 6.37\%.

Stable Minima Cannot Overfit in Univariate ReLU Networks: Generalization by Large Step Sizes
We study the generalization of two-layer ReLU neural networks in a univariate nonparametric regression problem with noisy labels. This is a problem where kernels (\emph{e.g.} NTK) are provably sub-optimal and benign overfitting does not happen, thus disqualifying existing theory for interpolating (0-loss, global optimal) solutions. We present a new theory of generalization for local minima that gradient descent with a constant learning rate can \emph{stably} converge to.  We show that gradient descent with a fixed learning rate $\eta$ can only find local minima that represent smooth functions with a certain weighted \emph{first order total variation} bounded by $1/\eta - 1/2 + \widetilde{O}(\sigma + \sqrt{\mathrm{MSE}})$ where $\sigma$ is the label noise level, $\mathrm{MSE}$ is short for mean squared error against the ground truth, and $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides a logarithmic factor. Under mild assumptions, we also prove a nearly-optimal MSE bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{-4/5})$  within the strict interior of the support of the $n$ data points. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive simulation that demonstrates large learning rate training induces sparse linear spline fits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to obtain generalization bound via minima stability in the non-interpolation case and the first to show ReLU NNs without regularization can achieve near-optimal rates in nonparametric regression.

Stable-Pose: Leveraging Transformers for Pose-Guided Text-to-Image Generation
Controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown impressive performance in generating high-quality visual content through the incorporation of various conditions. Current methods, however, exhibit limited performance when guided by skeleton human poses, especially in complex pose conditions such as side or rear perspectives of human figures. To address this issue, we present Stable-Pose, a novel adapter model that introduces a coarse-to-fine attention masking strategy into a vision Transformer (ViT) to gain accurate pose guidance for T2I models. Stable-Pose is designed to adeptly handle pose conditions within pre-trained Stable Diffusion, providing a refined and efficient way of aligning pose representation during image synthesis. We leverage the query-key self-attention mechanism of ViTs to explore the interconnections among different anatomical parts in human pose skeletons. Masked pose images are used to smoothly refine the attention maps based on target pose-related features in a hierarchical manner, transitioning from coarse to fine levels. Additionally, our loss function is formulated to allocate increased emphasis to the pose region, thereby augmenting the model's precision in capturing intricate pose details.    We assessed the performance of Stable-Pose across five public datasets under a wide range of indoor and outdoor human pose scenarios. Stable-Pose achieved an AP score of 57.1 in the LAION-Human dataset, marking around 13\% improvement over the established technique ControlNet.  The project link and code is available at~\url{https://github.com/---}.

START: A Generalized State Space Model with Saliency-Driven Token-Aware Transformation
Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enable models to generalize to unseen target domains by learning from multiple source domains. Existing DG methods primarily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which inherently learn texture biases due to their limited receptive fields, making them prone to overfitting source domains. While some works have introduced transformer-based methods (ViTs) for DG to leverage the global receptive field, these methods incur high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Recently, advanced state space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have shown promising results in supervised learning tasks by achieving linear complexity in sequence length during training and fast RNN-like computation during inference. Inspired by this, we investigate the generalization ability of the Mamba model under domain shifts and find that input-dependent matrices within SSMs could accumulate and amplify domain-specific features, thus hindering model generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel SSM-based architecture with saliency-based token-aware transformation (namely START), which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and offers a competitive alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Our START can selectively perturb and suppress domain-specific features in salient tokens within the input-dependent matrices of SSMs, thus effectively reducing the discrepancy between different domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that START outperforms existing SOTA DG methods with efficient linear complexity. Our code is available in the Supplementary Material.

Statistical and Geometrical properties of the Kernel Kullback-Leibler divergence
In this paper, we study the statistical and geometrical properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence with kernel covariance operators (KKL) introduced by [Bach, 2022, Information Theory with Kernel Methods]. Unlike the classical Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence that involves density ratios, the KKL compares probability distributions through covariance operators (embeddings) in a reproducible kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and compute the Kullback-Leibler quantum divergence. This novel divergence hence shares parallel but different aspects with both the standard Kullback-Leibler between probability distributions and kernel embeddings metrics such as the maximum mean discrepancy. A limitation faced with the original KKL divergence is its inability to be defined for distributions with disjoint supports. To solve this problem, we propose in this paper a regularised variant that guarantees that divergence is well defined for all distributions. We derive bounds that quantify the deviation of the regularised KKL to the original one, as well as concentration bounds. In addition, we provide a closed-form expression for the regularised KKL, specifically applicable when the distributions consist of finite sets of points, which makes it implementable. Furthermore, we derive a Wasserstein gradient descent scheme of the KKL divergence in the case of discrete distributions, and study empirically its properties to transport a set of points to a target distribution.

Statistical Multicriteria Benchmarking via the GSD-Front
Given the vast number of classifiers that have been (and continue to be) proposed, reliable methods for comparing them are becoming increasingly important. The desire for reliability is broken down into three main aspects: (1) Comparisons should allow for different quality metrics simultaneously. (2) Comparisons should take into account the statistical uncertainty induced by the choice of benchmark suite. (3) The robustness of the comparisons under small deviations in the underlying assumptions should be verifiable. To address (1), we propose to compare classifiers using a generalized stochastic dominance ordering (GSD) and present the GSD-front as an information-efficient alternative to the classical Pareto-front. For (2), we propose a consistent statistical estimator for the GSD-front and construct a statistical test for whether a (potentially new) classifier lies in the GSD-front of a set of state-of-the-art classifiers. For (3), we relax our proposed test using techniques from robust statistics and imprecise probabilities. We illustrate our concepts on the benchmark suite PMLB and on the platform OpenML.

Steganalysis on Digital Watermarking: Is Your Robustness a Maginot Line?
Digital watermarking techniques are crucial for copyright protection and source identification of images, especially in the era of generative AI models. However, many existing watermarking methods, particularly content-agnostic approaches that embed fixed patterns regardless of image content, are vulnerable to steganalysis attacks that can extract and remove the watermark with minimal perceptual distortion. In this work, we categorize watermarking algorithms into content-adaptive and content-agnostic classes and demonstrate how averaging a collection of watermarked images can reveal the underlying watermark pattern. We then leverage this extracted pattern for effective watermark removal under both graybox and practical blackbox settings, even when the collection contains multiple watermark patterns. For some algorithms like Tree-Ring watermarks, the extracted pattern can also forge convincing watermarks on clean images. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations across eight watermarking methods highlight the threat posed by steganalysis to content-agnostic watermarks and the importance of designing watermarking techniques resilient to such analytical attacks. We propose security guidelines calling for using content-adaptive watermarking strategies and performing security evaluation against steganalysis. We also suggest multi-key assignments as potential mitigations against steganalysis vulnerabilities.

StepbaQ: Stepping backward as Correction for Quantized Diffusion Models
Quantization of diffusion models has attracted considerable attention due to its potential to enable various applications on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, given the cumulative nature of quantization errors in quantized diffusion models, overall performance may still decline even with efforts to minimize quantization error at each sampling step.Recent studies have proposed several methods to address accumulated quantization error, yet these solutions often suffer from limited applicability due to their underlying assumptions or only partially resolve the issue due to an incomplete understanding.In this work, we introduce a novel perspective by conceptualizing quantization error as a "stepback" in the denoising process. We investigate how the accumulation of quantization error can distort the sampling trajectory, resulting in a notable decrease in model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce StepbaQ, a method that calibrates the sampling trajectory and counteracts the adverse effects of accumulated quantization error through a sampling step correction mechanism. Notably, StepbaQ relies solely on statistics of quantization error derived from a small calibration dataset, highlighting its strong applicability.Our experimental results demonstrate that StepbaQ can serve as a plug-and-play technique to enhance the performance of diffusion models quantized by off-the-shelf tools without modifying the quantization settings. For example, StepbaQ significantly improves the performance of the quantized SD v1.5 model by 7.30 in terms of FID on SDprompts dataset under the common W8A8 setting, and it enhances the performance of the quantized SDXL-Turbo model by 17.31 in terms of FID on SDprompts dataset under the challenging W4A8 setting.

Stepping on the Edge: Curvature Aware Learning Rate Tuners
Curvature information -- particularly, the largest eigenvalue of the lossHessian, known as the sharpness -- often forms the basis for learning ratetuners. However, recent work has shown that the curvature information undergoescomplex dynamics during training, going from a phase of increasing sharpness toeventual stabilization. We analyze the closed-loop feedback effect betweenlearning rate tuning and curvature. We find that classical learning rate tunersmay yield greater one-step loss reduction, yet they ultimately underperform inthe long term when compared to constant learning rates in the full batch regime.These models break the stabilization of the sharpness, which we explain using asimplified model of the joint dynamics of the learning rate and the curvature.To further investigate these effects, we introduce a new learning rate tuningmethod, Curvature Dynamics Aware Tuning (CDAT), which prioritizes long termcurvature stabilization over instantaneous progress on the objective. In thefull batch regime, CDAT shows behavior akin to prefixed warm-up schedules on deeplearning objectives, outperforming tuned constant learning rates. In the minibatch regime, we observe that stochasticity introduces confounding effects thatexplain the previous success of some learning rate tuners at appropriate batchsizes. Our findings highlight the critical role of understanding the jointdynamics of the learning rate and curvature, beyond greedy minimization, todiagnose failures and design effective adaptive learning rate tuners.

STimage-1K4M: A histopathology image-gene expression dataset for spatial transcriptomics
Recent advances in multi-modal algorithms have driven and been driven by the increasing availability of large image-text datasets, leading to significant strides in various fields, including computational pathology. However, in most existing medical image-text datasets, the text typically provides high-level summaries that may not sufficiently describe sub-tile regions within a large pathology image. For example, an image might cover an extensive tissue area containing cancerous and healthy regions, but the accompanying text might only specify that this image is a cancer slide, lacking the nuanced details needed for in-depth analysis. In this study, we introduce STimage-1K4M, a novel dataset designed to bridge this gap by providing genomic features for sub-tile images. STimage-1K4M contains 1,149 images derived from spatial transcriptomics data, which captures gene expression information at the level of individual spatial spots within a pathology image. Specifically, each image in the dataset is broken down into smaller sub-image tiles, with each tile paired with $15,000-30,000$ dimensional gene expressions. With $4,293,195$ pairs of sub-tile images and gene expressions, STimage-1K4M offers unprecedented granularity, paving the way for a wide range of advanced research in multi-modal data analysis an innovative applications in computational pathology, and beyond.

Stochastic Amortization: A Unified Approach to Accelerate Feature and Data Attribution
Many tasks in explainable machine learning, such as data valuation and feature attribution, perform expensive computation for each data point and are intractable for large datasets. These methods require efficient approximations, and although learning a network that directly predicts the desired output is a promising solution, training such models with exact labels is often infeasible. We therefore explore training amortized models with noisy labels, and we find that this is inexpensive and surprisingly effective. Through theoretical analysis of the label noise and experiments with various models and datasets, we show that this approach significantly accelerates several feature attribution and data valuation methods, often yielding an order of magnitude speedup over existing approaches.

Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models
Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising interpretable method whose final prediction is based on intermediate, human-understandable concepts rather than the raw input. Through time-consuming manual interventions, a user can correct wrongly predicted concept values to enhance the model's downstream performance. We propose *Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models* (SCBMs), a novel approach that models concept dependencies. In SCBMs, a single-concept intervention affects all correlated concepts, thereby improving intervention effectiveness. Unlike previous approaches that model the concept relations via an autoregressive structure, we introduce an explicit, distributional parameterization that allows SCBMs to retain the CBMs' efficient training and inference procedure. Additionally, we leverage the parameterization to derive an effective intervention strategy based on the confidence region. We show empirically on synthetic tabular and natural image datasets that our approach improves intervention effectiveness significantly. Notably, we showcase the versatility and usability of SCBMs by examining a setting with CLIP-inferred concepts, alleviating the need for manual concept annotations.

Stochastic Extragradient with Flip-Flop Shuffling & Anchoring: Provable Improvements
In minimax optimization, the extragradient (EG) method has been extensively studied because it outperforms the gradient descent-ascent method in convex-concave (C-C) problems. Yet, stochastic EG (SEG) has seen limited success in C-C problems, especially for unconstrained cases. Motivated by the recent progress of shuffling-based stochastic methods, we investigate the convergence of shuffling-based SEG in unconstrained finite-sum minimax problems, in search of convergent shuffling-based SEG. Our analysis reveals that both random reshuffling and the recently proposed flip-flop shuffling alone can suffer divergence in C-C problems. However, with an additional simple trick called anchoring, we develop the SEG with flip-flop anchoring (SEG-FFA) method which successfully converges in C-C problems. We also show upper and lower bounds in the strongly-convex-strongly-concave setting, demonstrating that SEG-FFA has a provably faster convergence rate compared to other shuffling-based methods.

Stochastic Kernel Regularisation Improves Generalisation in Deep Kernel Machines
Recent work developed convolutional deep kernel machines, achieving 92.7\% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 using a ResNet-inspired architecture, which is SOTA for kernel methods. However, this still lags behind neural networks, which easily achieve over 94\% test accuracy with similar architectures. In this work we introduce several modifications to improve the convolutional deep kernel machine's generalisation, including stochastic kernel regularisation, which adds noise to the learned Gram matrices during training. The resulting model achieves 94.5\% test accuracy on CIFAR-10. This finding has important theoretical and practical implications, as it demonstrates that the ability to perform well on complex tasks like image classification is not unique to neural networks. Instead, other approaches including deep kernel methods can achieve excellent performance on such tasks, as long as they have the capacity to learn representations from data.

Stochastic Newton Proximal Extragradient Method
Stochastic second-order methods are known to achieve fast local convergence in strongly convex optimization by relying on noisy Hessian estimates to precondition the gradient. Yet, most of these methods achieve superlinear convergence only when the stochastic Hessian noise diminishes, requiring an increase in the per-iteration cost as time progresses. Recent work in \cite{na2022hessian} addressed this issue via a Hessian averaging scheme that achieves a superlinear convergence rate without increasing the per-iteration cost. However, the considered method exhibits a slow global convergence rate, requiring up to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa^2)$ iterations to reach the superlinear rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((1/t)^{t/2})$, where $\kappa$ is the problem's condition number. In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic Newton proximal extragradient method that significantly improves these bounds, achieving a faster global linear rate and reaching the same fast superlinear rate in  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa)$ iterations. We achieve this by developing a novel extension of the Hybrid Proximal Extragradient (HPE) framework, which simultaneously achieves fast global and local convergence rates for strongly convex functions with access to a noisy Hessian oracle.

Stochastic Optimal Control for Diffusion Bridges in Function Spaces
Recent advancements in diffusion models and diffusion bridges primarily focus on finite-dimensional spaces, yet many real-world problems necessitate operations in infinite-dimensional function spaces for more natural and interpretable formulations. In this paper, we present a theory of stochastic optimal control (SOC) tailored to infinite-dimensional spaces, aiming to extend diffusion-based algorithms to function spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate how Doob’s $h$-transform, the fundamental tool for constructing diffusion bridges, can be derived from the SOC perspective and expanded to infinite dimensions. This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: 1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and 2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.

Stochastic Optimal Control Matching
Stochastic optimal control, which has the goal of driving the behavior of noisy systems, is broadly applicable in science, engineering and artificial intelligence. Our work introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel Iterative Diffusion Optimization (IDO) technique for stochastic optimal control that stems from the same philosophy as the conditional score matching loss for diffusion models. That is, the control is learned via a least squares problem by trying to fit a matching vector field. The training loss, which is closely connected to the cross-entropy loss, is optimized with respect to both the control function and a family of reparameterization matrices which appear in the matching vector field. The optimization with respect to the reparameterization matrices aims at minimizing the variance of the matching vector field. Experimentally, our algorithm achieves lower error than all the existing IDO techniques for stochastic optimal control for three out of four control problems, in some cases by an order of magnitude. The key idea underlying SOCM is the path-wise reparameterization trick, a novel technique that may be of independent interest.

Stochastic Zeroth-Order Optimization under Strongly Convexity and Lipschitz Hessian: Minimax Sample Complexity
Optimization of convex functions under stochastic zeroth-order feedback has been a major and challenging question in online learning. In this work, we consider the problem of optimizing second-order smooth and strongly convex functions where the algorithm is only accessible to noisy evaluations of the objective function it queries. We provide the first tight characterization for the rate of the minimax simple regret by developing matching upper and lower bounds. We propose an algorithm that features a combination of a bootstrapping stage and a mirror-descent stage. Our main technical innovation consists of a sharp characterization for the spherical-sampling gradient estimator under higher-order smoothness conditions, which allows the algorithm to optimally balance the bias-variance tradeoff, and a new iterative method for the bootstrapping stage, which maintains the performance for unbounded Hessian.

Stopping Bayesian Optimization with Probabilistic Regret Bounds
Bayesian optimization is a popular framework for efficiently finding high-quality solutions to difficult problems based on limited information. As a rule, these algorithms operate by iteratively choosing what to try next until some predefined budget has been exhausted. We investigate replacing this de facto stopping rule with criteria based on the probability that a point satisfies a given set of conditions.As a prototypical example, we focus on an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-criterion: stop when a solution has been found whose value is within $\epsilon > 0$ of the optimum with probability at least $1 - \delta$ under the model. For Gaussian process priors, we prove that Bayesian optimization satisfies this criterion under mild technical assumptions. Further, we give a practical algorithm for evaluating stopping rules with Monte Carlo estimators in a manner that is robust to estimation error. These findings are accompanied by empirical results which demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.

Streaming Bayes GFlowNets
Bayes' rule naturally allows for inference refinement in a streaming fashion, without the need to recompute posteriors from scratch whenever new data arrives. In principle, Bayesian streaming is straightforward: we update our prior with the available data and use the resulting posterior as a prior when processing the next data chunk. In practice, however, this recipe entails i) approximating an intractable posterior at each time step; and ii) encapsulating results appropriately to allow for posterior propagation. For continuous state spaces, variational inference (VI) is particularly convenient due to its scalability and the tractability of variational posteriors, For discrete state spaces, however, state-of-the-art VI results in analytically intractable approximations that are ill-suited for streaming settings. To enable streaming Bayesian inference over discrete parameter spaces, we propose streaming Bayes GFlowNets (abbreviated as SB-GFlowNets) by leveraging the recently proposed GFlowNets --- a powerful class of amortized samplers for discrete compositional objects. Notably, SB-GFlowNet approximates the initial posterior using a standard GFlowNet and subsequently updates it using a tailored procedure that requires only the newly observed data. Our case studies in linear preference learning and phylogenetic inference showcase the effectiveness of SB-GFlowNets in sampling from an unnormalized posterior in a streaming setting. As expected, we also observe that SB-GFlowNets is significantly faster than repeatedly training a GFlowNet from scratch to sample from the full posterior.

Stress-Testing Long-Context Language Models with Lifelong ICL and Task Haystack
We propose Lifelong ICL, a problem setting that challenges long-context language models (LMs) to learn various language tasks sequentially through in-context learning (ICL).We further introduce Task Haystack, an evaluation suite designed for assessing and diagnosing how long-context LMs use long contexts.When given a task instruction and test inputs, long-context LMs are expected to leverage the same-task demonstrations in the Lifelong ICL prompt, avoid distraction from other tasks, and achieve a test accuracy no worse than its single-task ICL baseline.Task Haystack draws inspiration from the widely-adopted ``needle-in-a-haystack'' (NIAH) evaluation, but presents new and unique challenges. It demands that models (1) utilize context in a genuinely contextualized manner, rather than resorting to simple copying and pasting; (2) navigate through long streams of evolving topics and tasks, which closely approximates the complexities of real-world scenarios faced by long-context LMs.Additionally, Task Haystack inherits the controllability aspect of NIAH, providing model developers with tools and visualizations to identify model vulnerabilities effectively.We benchmark ten long-context LMs using Task Haystack. We find that state-of-the-art closed models such as GPT-4o still struggle in this setting, failing 12.5\% of the cases on average, while all open models we evaluate further lack behind by a large margin.In our controlled analysis, we find that long-context LMs are susceptible to distractibility and recency bias, and these two factors both contribute to the failure cases. Further, we observe declines in performance when task instructions are paraphrased at test time or when ICL demonstrations are repeated excessively, raising concerns about the robustness, instruction understanding, and true context utilization of current long-context LMs.We release our code and data to encourage further research that addresses these limitations.

Structured Multi-Track Accompaniment Arrangement via Style Prior Modelling
In the realm of music AI, arranging rich and structured multi-track accompaniments from a simple lead sheet poses significant challenges in context coherency, music creativity, and computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel system that leverages prior modelling over disentangled style factors to address these challenges. Our method presents a two-stage process: initially, a piano arrangement is derived from the lead sheet by retrieving piano texture styles; subsequently, a multi-track orchestration is achieved by infusing orchestral function styles into the piano arrangement. The key design is to employ vector quantization and a unique multi-stream Transformer to model the long-term flow of orchestration style, leading to flexible and controllable music generation. Experiments show that by factorizing the arrangement task into interpretable sub-stages, our approach enhances generative capacity. Additionally, the system supports varied music genres and provides style control at different compositional hierarchies. Lastly, we demonstrate that our system delivers superior arrangement quality over existing baseline methods.

Structured Unrestricted-Rank Matrices for Parameter Efficient Finetuning
Recent efforts to scale Transformer models have demonstrated rapid progress across a wide range of tasks (Wei at. al 2022). However, fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks is quite expensive due to their large parameter counts. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches have emerged as a viable alternative, allowing us to fine-tune models by updating only a small number of parameters. In this work, we propose a general framework for parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), based on *structured unrestricted-rank matrices* (SURM)  which can serve as a drop-in replacement for popular approaches such as Adapters and LoRA. Unlike other methods like LoRA, SURMs give us more flexibility in finding the right balance between compactness and expressiveness. This is achieved by using *low displacement rank matrices* (LDRMs), which hasn't been used in this context before. SURMs remain competitive with baselines, often providing significant quality improvements while using a smaller parameter budget. SURMs achieve: **5**-**7**% accuracy gains on various image classification tasks while replacing low-rank matrices in LoRA and: up to **12x** reduction of the number of parameters in adapters (with virtually no loss in quality) on the GLUE benchmark.

Style Adaptation and Uncertainty Estimation for Multi-source Blended-Target Domain Adaptation
Blended-target domain adaptation (BTDA), which implicitly mixes multiple sub-target domains into a fine domain, has attracted more attention in recent years. Most previously developed BTDA approaches focus on utilizing a single source domain, which makes it difficult to obtain sufficient feature information for learning domain-invariant representations. Furthermore, different feature distributions derived from different domain may increase the uncertainty of models. To overcome these issues, we propose a style adaptation and uncertainty estimation (SAUE) approach for multi-source blended-target domain adaptation (MBDA). Specifically, we exploit the extra knowledge acquired from the blended-target domain, where a similarity factor is adopted to select more useful target style information for augmenting the source features. Then, to mitigate the negative impact of the domain-specific attributes, we devise a function to estimate and mitigate uncertainty in category prediction. Finally, we construct a simple and lightweight adversarial learning strategy for MBDA, effectively aligning multi-source and blended-target domains without the requirements of the domain labels of the target domains. Extensive experiments conducted on several challenging DA benchmarks, including the ImageCLEF-DA, Office-Home, and DomainNet datasets, demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.

Stylebreeder: Exploring and Democratizing Artistic Styles through Text-to-Image Models
Text-to-image models are becoming increasingly popular, revolutionizing the landscape of digital art creation by enabling highly detailed and creative visual content generation. These models have been widely employed across various domains, particularly in art generation, where they facilitate a broad spectrum of creative expression and democratize access to artistic creation.  In this paper, we introduce \texttt{STYLEBREEDER}, a comprehensive dataset of 6.8M images and 1.8M prompts generated by 95K users on Artbreeder,  a platform that has emerged as a significant hub for creative exploration with over 13M users.  We introduce a series of tasks with this dataset aimed at identifying diverse artistic styles, generating personalized content, and recommending styles based on user interests. By documenting unique, user-generated styles that transcend conventional categories like 'cyberpunk' or 'Picasso,' we explore the potential for unique, crowd-sourced styles that could provide deep insights into the collective creative psyche of users worldwide. We also evaluate different personalization methods to enhance artistic expression and introduce a style atlas, making these models available in LoRA format for public use. Our research demonstrates the potential of text-to-image diffusion models to uncover and promote unique artistic expressions, further democratizing AI in art and fostering a more diverse and inclusive artistic community. The dataset, code and models are available at  https://stylebreeder.github.io under a Public Domain (CC0) license.

Stylus: Automatic Adapter Selection for Diffusion Models
Beyond scaling base models with more data or parameters, fine-tuned adapters provide an alternative way to generate high fidelity, custom images at reduced costs. As such, adapters have been widely adopted by open-source communities, accumulating a database of over 100K adapters—most of which are highly customized with insufficient descriptions. To generate high quality images, this paper explores the problem of matching the prompt to a Stylus of relevant adapters, built on recent work that highlight the performance gains of composing adapters. We introduce Stylus, which efficiently selects and automatically composes task-specific adapters based on a prompt's keywords. Stylus outlines a three-stage approach that first summarizes adapters with improved descriptions and embeddings, retrieves relevant adapters, and then further assembles adapters based on prompts' keywords by checking how well they fit the prompt. To evaluate Stylus, we developed StylusDocs, a curated dataset featuring 75K adapters with pre-computed adapter embeddings. In our evaluation on popular Stable Diffusion checkpoints, Stylus achieves greater CLIP/FID Pareto efficiency and is twice as preferred, with humans and multimodal models as evaluators, over the base model.

SubgDiff: A Subgraph Diffusion Model to Improve Molecular Representation Learning
Molecular representation learning has shown great success in advancing AI-based drug discovery. A key insight of many recent works is that the 3D geometric structure of molecules provides essential information about their physicochemical properties. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have achieved impressive performance in molecular 3D conformation generation.  However, most existing molecular diffusion models treat each atom as an independent entity, overlooking the dependency among atoms within the substructures. This paper introduces a novel approach that enhances molecular representation learning by incorporating substructural information in the diffusion model framework. We propose a novel diffusion model termed SubgDiff for involving the molecular subgraph information in diffusion. Specifically, SubgDiff adopts three vital techniques: i) subgraph prediction, ii) expectation state, and iii) $k$-step same subgraph diffusion, to enhance the perception of molecular substructure in the denoising network. Experiments on extensive downstream tasks, especially the molecular force predictions, demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.

SuperDeepFool: a new fast and accurate minimal adversarial attack
Deep neural networks have been known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are inputs that are modified slightly to fool the network into making incorrect predictions. This has led to a significant amount of research on evaluating the robustness of these networks against such perturbations. One particularly important robustness metric is the robustness to minimal $\ell_{2}$ adversarial perturbations. However, existing methods for evaluating this robustness metric are either computationally expensive or not very accurate. In this paper, we introduce a new family of adversarial attacks that strike a balance between effectiveness and computational efficiency. Our proposed attacks are generalizations of the well-known DeepFool (DF) attack, while they remain simple to understand and implement. We demonstrate that our attacks outperform existing methods in terms of both effectiveness and computational efficiency. Our proposed attacks are also suitable for evaluating the robustness of large models and can be used to perform adversarial training (AT) to achieve state-of-the-art robustness to minimal $\ell_{2}$ adversarial perturbations.

SuperVLAD: Compact and Robust Image Descriptors for Visual Place Recognition
Visual place recognition (VPR) is an essential task for multiple applications such as augmented reality and robot localization. Over the past decade, mainstream methods in the VPR area have been to use feature representation based on global aggregation, as exemplified by NetVLAD. These features are suitable for large-scale VPR and robust against viewpoint changes. However, the VLAD-based aggregation methods usually learn a large number of (e.g., 64) clusters and their corresponding cluster centers, which directly leads to a high dimension of the yielded global features. More importantly, when there is a domain gap between the data in training and inference, the cluster centers determined on the training set are usually improper for inference, resulting in a performance drop. To this end, we first attempt to improve NetVLAD by removing the cluster center and setting only a small number of (e.g., only 4) clusters. The proposed method not only simplifies NetVLAD but also enhances the generalizability across different domains. We name this method SuperVLAD. In addition, by introducing ghost clusters that will not be retained in the final output, we further propose a very low-dimensional 1-Cluster VLAD descriptor, which has the same dimension as the output of GeM pooling but performs notably better. Experimental results suggest that, when paired with a transformer-based backbone, our SuperVLAD outperforms NetVLAD with significantly more compact features and better domain generalization performance. The proposed method also surpasses state-of-the-art methods with lower feature dimensions on several benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly available.

Suppress Content Shift: Better Diffusion Features via Off-the-Shelf Generation Techniques
Diffusion models are powerful generative models, and this capability can also be applied to discrimination. The inner activations of a pre-trained diffusion model can serve as features for discriminative tasks, namely, diffusion feature. We discover that diffusion feature has been hindered by a hidden yet universal phenomenon that we call content shift. To be specific, there are content differences between features and the input image, such as the exact shape of a certain object. We locate the cause of content shift as one inherent characteristic of diffusion models, which suggests the broad existence of this phenomenon in diffusion feature. Further empirical study also indicates that its negative impact is not negligible even when content shift is not visually perceivable. Hence, we propose to suppress content shift to enhance the overall quality of diffusion features. Specifically, content shift is related to the information drift during the process of recovering an image from the noisy input, pointing out the possibility of turning off-the-shelf generation techniques into tools for content shift suppression. We further propose a practical guideline named GATE to efficiently evaluate the potential benefit of a technique and provide an implementation of our methodology. Despite the simplicity, the proposed approach has achieved superior results on various tasks and datasets, validating its potential as a generic booster for diffusion features.

SureMap: Simultaneous mean estimation for single-task and multi-task disaggregated evaluation
Disaggregated evaluation---estimating the performance of a machine learning model on different subpopulations---is an important task in the performance and group-fairness assessment of AI systems.However, evaluation data is scarce, and subpopulations arising from intersections of attributes (e.g., race, sex, gender) are often tiny. Today, it is common for multiple clients to procure the same AI model from a model developer, and the challenge of disaggregated evaluation is faced by each customer individually.  This gives rise to what we call the \textit{multi-task disaggregated evaluation problem}, wherein multiple clients seek to conduct a disaggregated evaluation of a given model in their own data setting (task).  In this work we develop a disaggregated evaluation method called **SureMap** that has high estimation accuracy for both multi-task *and* single-task disaggregated evaluations.  SureMap's efficiency gains come from (1) transforming the problem into structured simultaneous Gaussian mean estimation and (2) incorporating external data, e.g. from the AI system creator or from their other clients.  The method combines *maximum a posteriori* (MAP) estimation using a well-chosen prior together with cross-validation-free tuning via Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE).We evaluate SureMap on disaggregated evaluation tasks in multiple domains, observing significant accuracy improvements over several strong baselines.

SVFT: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Singular Vectors
Popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA and its variants, freeze pre-trained model weights \(\mathbf{W}\) and inject learnable matrices \(\mathbf{\Delta W}\).  These \(\mathbf{\Delta W}\) matrices are structured for efficient parameterization, often using techniques like low-rank approximations or scaling vectors.  However, these methods typically show a performance gap compared to full fine-tuning.  Although recent PEFT methods have narrowed this gap, they do so at the cost of additional learnable parameters. We propose SVFT, a \textit{simple} approach that fundamentally differs from existing methods: the structure imposed on \(\mathbf{\Delta W}\) depends on the specific weight matrix \(\mathbf{W}\). Specifically, SVFT updates \(\mathbf{W}\) as a sparse combination of outer products of its singular vectors, training only the coefficients (scales) of these sparse combinations. This approach allows fine-grained control over expressivity through the number of coefficients. Extensive experiments on language and vision benchmarks show that SVFT recovers up to 96% of full fine-tuning performance while training only 0.006% to 0.25\% of parameters, outperforming existing methods that only recover up to 85% performance using 0.03% to 0.8% of the trainable parameter budget.

Swift Sampler: Efficient Learning of Sampler by 10 parameters
Data selection is essential for training deep learning models. An effective data sampler assigns proper sampling probability for training data and helps the model converge to a good local minimum with high performance. Previous studies in data sampling are mainly based on heuristic rules or learning through a huge amount of time-consuming trials. In this paper, we propose an automatic swift sampler search algorithm, SS, to explore automatically learning effective samplers efficiently. In particular, SS utilizes a novel formulation to map a sampler to a low dimension of hyper-parameters and uses an approximated local minimum to quickly examine the quality of a sampler. Benefiting from its low computational expense, SS can be applied on large-scale data sets with high efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate that SS powered sampling can achieve obvious improvements (e.g., 1.5% on ImageNet) and transfer among different neural networks.

Symmetries In-Context: Universal Self-Supervised Learning through Contextual World Models
At the core of self-supervised learning for vision is the idea of learning invariant or equivariant representations with respect to a set of data transformations. This approach, however, introduces strong inductive biases, which can render the representations fragile in downstream tasks that do not conform to these symmetries. In this work, drawing insights from world models, we propose to instead learn a general representation that can adapt to be invariant or equivariant to different transformations by paying attention to context --- a memory module that tracks task-specific states, actions and future states. Here, the action is the transformation, while the current and future states respectively represent the input's representation before and after the transformation.  Our proposed algorithm, Contextual Self Supervised Learning (ContextSSL), learns equivariance to all transformations (as opposed to invariance). In this way, the model can learn to encode all relevant features as general representations while having the versatility to tail down to task-wise symmetries when given a few examples as the context. Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains over existing methods on equivariance-related tasks, supported by both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Symmetry-Informed Governing Equation Discovery
Despite the advancements in learning governing differential equations from observations of dynamical systems, data-driven methods are often unaware of fundamental physical laws, such as frame invariance. As a result, these algorithms may search an unnecessarily large space and discover equations that are less accurate or overly complex. In this paper, we propose to leverage symmetry in automated equation discovery to compress the equation search space and improve the accuracy and simplicity of the learned equations. Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming. In experiments across a diverse range of dynamical systems, our approach demonstrates better robustness against noise and recovers governing equations with significantly higher probability than baselines without symmetry.

SyncTweedies: A General Generative Framework Based on Synchronized Diffusions
We introduce a general diffusion synchronization framework for generating diverse visual content, including ambiguous images, panorama images, mesh textures, and Gaussian splat textures, using a pretrained image diffusion model. We first present an analysis of various scenarios for synchronizing multiple diffusion processes through a canonical space. Based on the analysis, we introduce a novel synchronized diffusion method, SyncTweedies, which averages the outputs of Tweedie's formula while conducting denoising in multiple instance spaces. Compared to previous work that achieves synchronization through finetuning, SyncTweedies is a zero-shot method that does not require any finetuning, preserving the rich prior of diffusion models trained on Internet-scale image datasets without overfitting to specific domains. We verify that SyncTweedies offers the broadest applicability to diverse applications and superior performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art for each application.

System-2 Reasoning at Scale
Our workshop focuses on improving reasoning in neural networks, particularly the challenges and strategies for achieving System-2 reasoning in transformer-like models. The workshop addresses issues like distinguishing memorization from rule-based learning, understanding, syntactic generalization, and compositionality. The workshop also covers the importance of understanding how systematic models are in their decisions for AI safety, integrating neural networks with symbolic reasoning, and developing new architectures for enhanced reasoning capabilities. We have (tentatively) confirmed a distinguished group of speakers and panelists who are some of the most influential figures in recent literature on reasoning.  Considering how important these topics are today and our distinguished lineup of speakers, we expect \textbf{more than 500 participants to the workshop}.

T2V-Turbo: Breaking the Quality Bottleneck of Video Consistency Model with Mixed Reward Feedback
Diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models have achieved significant success but continue to be hampered by the slow sampling speed of their iterative sampling processes. To address the challenge, consistency models have been proposed to facilitate fast inference, albeit at the cost of sample quality. In this work, we aim to break the quality bottleneck of a video consistency model (VCM) to achieve **both fast and high-quality video generation**. We introduce T2V-Turbo, which integrates feedback from a mixture of differentiable reward models into the consistency distillation (CD) process of a pre-trained T2V model. Notably, we directly optimize rewards associated with single-step generations that arise naturally from computing the CD loss, effectively bypassing the memory constraints imposed by backpropagating gradients through an iterative sampling process. Remarkably, the 4-step generations from our T2V-Turbo achieve the highest total score on VBench, even surpassing Gen-2 and Pika. We further conduct human evaluations to corroborate the results, validating that the 4-step generations from our T2V-Turbo are preferred over the 50-step DDIM samples from their teacher models, representing more than a tenfold acceleration while improving video generation quality.

TabEBM: A Tabular Data Augmentation Method with Class-Specific Energy-Based Models
Data collection is often difficult in critical fields such as medicine, physics, and chemistry. As a result, classification methods usually perform poorly with these small datasets, leading to weak predictive performance. Increasing the training set with additional synthetic data, similar to data augmentation in images, is commonly believed to improve downstream classification performance. However, current tabular generative methods that learn either the joint distribution p(x, y) or the class-conditional distribution p(x | y) often overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor-quality synthetic data, usually worsening classification performance compared to using real data alone. To solve these challenges, we introduce TabEBM, a novel class-conditional generative method using Energy-Based Models (EBMs). Unlike existing methods that use a shared model to approximate all class-conditional densities, our key innovation is to create distinct EBM generative models for each class, each modelling its class-specific data distribution individually. This approach creates robust energy landscapes, even in ambiguous class distributions. Our experiments show that TabEBM generates synthetic data with higher quality and better statistical fidelity than existing methods. When used for data augmentation, our synthetic data consistently improves the classification performance across various datasets of various sizes, especially small ones.

TabularBench: Benchmarking Adversarial Robustness for Tabular Deep Learning in Real-world Use-cases
While adversarial robustness in computer vision is a mature research field, fewer researchers have tackled the evasion attacks against tabular deep learning, and even fewer investigated robustification mechanisms and reliable defenses. We hypothesize that this lag in the research on tabular adversarial attacks is in part due to the lack of standardized benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose TabularBench, the first comprehensive benchmark of robustness of tabular deep learning classification models. We evaluated adversarial robustness with CAA, an ensemble of gradient and search attacks which was recently demonstrated as the most effective attack against a tabular model. In addition to our open benchmark https://github.com/serval-uni-lu/tabularbench where we welcome submissions of new models and defenses, we implement 7 robustification mechanisms inspired by state-of-the-art defenses in computer vision and propose the largest benchmark of robust tabular deep learning over 200 models across five critical scenarios in finance, healthcare and security. We curated real datasets for each use case, augmented with hundreds of thousands of realistic synthetic inputs, and trained and assessed our models with and without data augmentations. We open-source our library that provides API access to all our pre-trained robust tabular models, and the largest datasets of real and synthetic tabular inputs. Finally, we analyze the impact of various defenses on the robustness and provide actionable insights to design new defenses and robustification mechanisms.

Tactile DreamFusion: Exploiting Tactile Sensing for 3D Generation
3D generation methods have shown visually compelling results powered by diffusion image priors. However, they often fail to produce realistic geometric details, resulting in overly smooth surfaces or geometric details inaccurately baked in albedo maps. To address this, we introduce a new method that incorporates touch as an additional modality to improve the geometric details of generated 3D assets. We design a lightweight 3D texture field to synthesize visual and tactile textures, guided by a normal-conditioned ControlNet that ensures the consistency between visual and tactile textures while preserving photorealism. We further present a multi-part editing pipeline that enables us to synthesize different textures across various regions. To our knowledge, we are the first to leverage high-resolution tactile sensing to enhance geometric details for 3D generation tasks. We evaluate our method on both text-to-3D and image-to-3D settings. Our experiments demonstrate that our method provides customized and realistic fine geometric textures while maintaining accurate alignment between two modalities of vision and touch.

Talking Heads: Understanding Inter-Layer Communication in Transformer Language Models
Although it is known that transformer language models (LMs) pass features from early layers to later layers, it is not well understood how this information is represented and routed by the model. By analyzing particular mechanism LMs use to accomplish this, we find that it is also used to recall items from a list, and show that this mechanism can explain an otherwise arbitrary-seeming sensitivity of the model to the order of items in the prompt. Specifically, we find that models write into low-rank subspaces of the residual stream to represent features which are then read out by specific later layers, forming low-rank \textbf{communication channels} between layers. By decomposing attention head weight matrices with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we find that previously described interactions between heads separated by one or more layers can be predicted via analysis their weight matrices. We show that it is possible to manipulate the internal model representations as well as edit model weights, based on the mechanism we discover, in order to significantly improve performance on our synthetic Laundry List task, which requires recall from a list, often improving task accuracy by over 20\%. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly intricate interpretable structure learned from language model pretraining, and helps us understand why sophisticated LMs sometimes fail in simple domains, facilitating future analysis of more complex behaviors.

TALoS: Enhancing Semantic Scene Completion via Test-time Adaptation on the Line of Sight
Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to perform geometric completion and semantic segmentation simultaneously. Despite the promising results achieved by existing studies, the inherently ill-posed nature of the task presents significant challenges in diverse driving scenarios. This paper introduces TALoS, a novel test-time adaptation approach for SSC that excavates the information available in driving environments. Specifically, we focus on that observations made at a certain moment can serve as Ground Truth (GT) for scene completion at another moment. Given the characteristics of the LiDAR sensor, an observation of an object at a certain location confirms both 1) the occupation of that location and 2) the absence of obstacles along the line of sight from the LiDAR to that point. TALoS utilizes these observations to obtain self-supervision about occupancy and emptiness, guiding the model to adapt to the scene in test time. In a similar manner, we aggregate reliable SSC predictions among multiple moments and leverage them as semantic pseudo-GT for adaptation. Further, to leverage future observations that are not accessible at the current time, we present a dual optimization scheme using the model in which the update is delayed until the future observation is available. Evaluations on the SemanticKITTI validation and test sets demonstrate that TALoS significantly improves the performance of the pre-trained SSC model.

Taming Diffusion Prior for Image Super-Resolution with Domain Shift SDEs
Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) models have attracted substantial interest due to their powerful image restoration capabilities. However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a $\textbf{Do}$main $\textbf{S}$hift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring $\textbf{\emph{only 5 sampling steps}}$. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

Taming Generative Diffusion Prior for Universal Blind Image Restoration
Diffusion models have been widely utilized for image restoration. However, previous blind image restoration methods still need to assume the type of degradation model while leaving the parameters to be optimized, limiting their real-world applications. Therefore, we aim to tame generative diffusion prior for universal blind image restoration dubbed BIR-D, which utilizes an optimizable convolutional kernel to simulate the degradation model and dynamically update the parameters of the kernel in the diffusion steps, enabling it to achieve blind image restoration results even in various complex situations. Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter. Experimentally, Our BIR-D has demonstrated superior practicality and versatility than off-the-shelf unsupervised methods across various tasks both on real-world and synthetic datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. BIR-D is able to fulfill multi-guidance blind image restoration. Moreover, BIR-D can also restore images that undergo multiple and complicated degradations, demonstrating the practical applications.

Taming the Long Tail in Human Mobility Prediction
With the popularity of location-based services, human mobility prediction plays a key role in enhancing personalized navigation, optimizing recommendation systems, and facilitating urban mobility and planning. This involves predicting a user's next POI (point-of-interest) visit using their past visit history. However, the uneven distribution of visitations over time and space, namely the long-tail problem in spatial distribution, makes it difficult for AI models to predict those POIs that are less visited by humans. In light of this issue, we propose the $\underline{\bf{Lo}}$ng-$\underline{\bf{T}}$ail Adjusted $\underline{\bf{Next}}$ POI Prediction (LoTNext) framework for mobility prediction, combining a Long-Tailed Graph Adjustment module to reduce the impact of the long-tailed nodes in the user-POI interaction graph and a novel Long-Tailed Loss Adjustment module to adjust loss by logit score and sample weight adjustment strategy. Also, we employ the auxiliary prediction task to enhance generalization and accuracy. Our experiments with two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that LoTNext significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art works. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LoTNext/.

TAPTRv2: Tracking Any Point with Transformers as Detection
In this paper, we present TAPTRv2, a Transformer-based approach built upon TAPTR for solving the Tracking Any Point (TAP) task. TAPTR borrows designs from DEtection TRansformer (DETR) and formulates each tracking point as a point query, making it possible to leverage well-studied operations in DETR-like algorithms. TAPTRv2 improves TAPTR by addressing a critical issue regarding its reliance on cost-volume, which contaminates the point query’s content feature and negatively impacts both visibility prediction and cost-volume computation. In TAPTRv2, we propose a novel attention-based position update (APU) operation and use key-aware deformable attention to realize. For each query, this operation uses key-aware attention weights to combine their corresponding deformable sampling positions to predict a new query position. This design is based on the observation that local attention is essentially the same as cost-volume, both of which are computed by dot-production between a query and its surrounding features. By introducing this new operation, TAPTRv2 not only removes the extra burden of cost-volume computation, but also leads to a substantial performance improvement. TAPTRv2 surpasses TAPTR and achieves state-of-the-art performance on many challenging datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Targeted Sequential Indirect Experiment Design
Scientific hypotheses typically concern specific aspects of complex, imperfectly understood or entirely unknown mechanisms, such as the effect of gene expression levels on phenotypes or how microbial communities influence environmental health. Such queries are inherently causal (rather than purely associational), but in many settings, experiments can not be conducted directly on the target variables of interest, but are indirect. Therefore, they perturb the target variable, but do not remove potential confounding factors. If, additionally, the resulting experimental measurements are high-dimensional and the studied mechanisms nonlinear, the query of interest is generally not identified. We develop an adaptive strategy to design indirect experiments that optimally inform a targeted query about the ground truth mechanism in terms of sequentially narrowing the gap between an upper and lower bound on the query. While the general formulation consists of a bi-level optimization procedure, we derive an efficiently estimable analytical kernel-based estimator of the bounds for the causal effect, a query of key interest, and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in confounded, multivariate, nonlinear synthetic settings.

Target-Guided Adversarial Point Cloud Transformer Towards Recognition Against Real-world Corruptions
Achieving robust 3D perception in the face of corrupted data presents an challenging hurdle within 3D vision research. Contemporary transformer-based point cloud recognition models, albeit advanced, tend to overfit to specific patterns, consequently undermining their robustness against corruption. In this work, we introduce the Target-Guided Adversarial Point Cloud Transformer, termed APCT, a novel architecture designed to augment global structure capture through an adversarial feature erasing mechanism predicated on patterns discerned at each step during training. Specifically, APCT integrates an Adversarial Significance Identifier and a Target-guided Promptor. The Adversarial Significance Identifier, is tasked with discerning token significance by integrating global contextual analysis, utilizing a structural salience index algorithm alongside an auxiliary supervisory mechanism. The Target-guided Promptor, is responsible for accentuating the propensity for token discard within the self-attention mechanism, utilizing the value derived above, consequently directing the model attention towards alternative segments in subsequent stages. By iteratively applying this strategy in multiple steps during training, the network progressively identifies and integrates an expanded array of object-associated patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple corruption benchmarks.

Task-Agnostic Machine Learning-Assisted Inference
Machine learning (ML) is playing an increasingly important role in scientific research. In conjunction with classical statistical approaches, ML-assisted analytical strategies have shown great promises in accelerating research findings. This has also opened up a whole field of methodological research focusing on integrative approaches that leverage both ML and statistics to tackle data science challenges. One type of study that has quickly gained popularity employs ML to predict unobserved outcomes in massive samples, and then uses predicted outcomes in downstream statistical inference. However, existing methods designed to ensure validity of this type of post-prediction inference are limited to very basic tasks such as linear regression analysis. This is because any extension of these approaches to new, more sophisticated statistical tasks requires task-specific algebraic derivations and software implementations, which ignores the massive library of existing software tools already developed for complex inference tasks and severely constraints the scope of post-prediction inference in real applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel statistical framework for task-agnostic ML-assisted inference. It provides a post-prediction inference solution that can be easily plugged into almost any established data analysis routine. It delivers valid and efficient inference that is robust to arbitrary choices of ML model, while allowing nearly all existing analytical frameworks to be incorporated into analysis of ML-predicted outcomes. Through extensive experiments, we showcase the validity, versatility, and superiority of our method compared to existing approaches.

Task Confusion and Catastrophic Forgetting in Class-Incremental Learning: A Mathematical Framework for Discriminative and Generative Modelings
In class-incremental learning (class-IL), models must classify all previously seen classes at test time without task-IDs, leading to task confusion. Despite being a key challenge, task confusion lacks a theoretical understanding. We present a novel mathematical framework for class-IL and prove the Infeasibility Theorem, showing optimal class-IL is impossible with discriminative modeling due to task confusion. However, we establish the Feasibility Theorem, demonstrating that generative modeling can achieve optimal class-IL by overcoming task confusion. We then assess popular class-IL strategies, including regularization, bias-correction, replay, and generative classifier, using our framework. Our analysis suggests that adopting generative modeling, either for generative replay or direct classification (generative classifier), is essential for optimal class-IL.

Task-recency bias strikes back: Adapting covariances in Exemplar-Free Class Incremental Learning
Exemplar-Free Class Incremental Learning (EFCIL) tackles the problem of training a model on a sequence of tasks without access to past data. Existing state-of-the-art methods represent classes as Gaussian distributions in the feature extractor's latent space, enabling Bayes classification or training the classifier by replaying pseudo features. However, we identify two critical issues that compromise their efficacy when the feature extractor is updated on incremental tasks. First, they do not consider that classes' covariance matrices change and must be adapted after each task. Second, they are susceptible to a task-recency bias caused by dimensionality collapse occurring during training. In this work, we propose AdaGauss - a novel method that adapts covariance matrices from task to task and mitigates the task-recency bias owing to the additional anti-collapse loss function. AdaGauss yields state-of-the-art results on popular EFCIL benchmarks and datasets when training from scratch or starting from a pre-trained backbone.

TEG-DB: A Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark of Textual-Edge Graphs
Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) augment graph structures with natural language descriptions, facilitating detailed depictions of data and their interconnections across various real-world settings. However, existing TAG datasets predominantly feature textual information only at the nodes, with edges typically represented by mere binary or categorical attributes. This lack of rich textual edge annotations significantly limits the exploration of contextual relationships between entities, hindering deeper insights into graph-structured data. To address this gap, we introduce Textual-Edge Graphs Datasets and Benchmark (TEG-DB), a comprehensive and diverse collection of benchmark textual-edge datasets featuring rich textual descriptions on nodes and edges. The TEG-DB datasets are large-scale and encompass a wide range of domains, from citation networks to social networks. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments on TEG-DB to assess the extent to which current techniques, including pre-trained language models, graph neural networks, and their combinations, can utilize textual node and edge information. Our goal is to elicit advancements in   textual-edge graph research, specifically in developing methodologies that exploit rich textual node and edge descriptions to enhance graph analysis and provide deeper insights into complex real-world networks. The entire TEG-DB project is publicly accessible as an open-source repository on Github, accessible at https://github.com/Zhuofeng-Li/TEG-Benchmark.

Tensor-Based Synchronization and the Low-Rankness of the Block Trifocal Tensor
The block tensor of trifocal tensors provides crucial geometric information on the three-view geometry of a scene. The underlying synchronization problem seeks to recover camera poses (locations and orientations up to a global transformation) from the block trifocal tensor.  We establish an explicit Tucker factorization of this tensor, revealing a low multilinear rank of $(6,4,4)$ independent of the number of cameras under appropriate scaling conditions. We prove that this rank constraint provides sufficient information for camera recovery in the noiseless case. The constraint motivates a synchronization algorithm based on the higher-order singular value decomposition of the block trifocal tensor. Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art global synchronization methods on real datasets demonstrate the potential of this algorithm for significantly improving location estimation accuracy. Overall this work suggests that higher-order interactions in synchronization problems can be exploited to improve performance, beyond the usual pairwise-based approaches.

Testably Learning Polynomial Threshold Functions
Rubinfeld \& Vasilyan recently introduced the framework of *testable learning* as an extension of the classical agnostic model. It relaxes distributional assumptions which are difficult to verify by conditions that can be checked efficiently by a *tester*. The tester has to accept whenever the data truly satisfies the original assumptions, and the learner has to succeed whenever the tester accepts. We focus on the setting where the tester has to accept standard Gaussian data. There, it is known that basic concept classes such as halfspaces can be learned testably with the same time complexity as in the (distribution-specific) agnostic model. In this work, we ask whether there is a price to pay for testably learning more complex concept classes. In particular, we consider polynomial threshold functions (PTFs), which naturally generalize halfspaces. We show that PTFs of arbitrary constant degree can be testably learned up to excess error $\varepsilon > 0$ in time $n^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$. This qualitatively matches the best known guarantees in the agnostic model. Our results build on a connection between testable learning and *fooling*. In particular, we show that distributions that approximately match at least $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ moments of the standard Gaussian fool constant-degree PTFs (up to error $\varepsilon$). As a secondary result, we prove that a direct approach to show testable learning (without fooling), which was successfully used for halfspaces, cannot work for PTFs.

Test-Time Adaptation Induces Stronger Accuracy and Agreement-on-the-Line
Recently, Miller et al. (2021) and Baek et al. (2022) empirically demonstrated strong linear correlations between in-distribution (ID) versus out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy and agreement.  These phenomena, termed accuracy-on-the-line (ACL) and agreement-on-the-line (AGL) furthermore often exhibited the same slope and bias of the correlations, enabling OOD model selection and performance estimation without labeled data. However, the phenomena also break for certain shift, such as CIFAR10-C Gaussian Noise, posing a critical bottleneck in accurately predicting OOD performance without access to labels. In this paper, we make a key finding that recent OOD test-time adaptation methods not only improve OOD performance, but drastically strengthen the AGL and ACL phenomenon, even in shifts that initially observed very weak correlations. To analyze this, we revisit the theoretical conditions established by Miller et al. (2021), which demonstrate that ACL appears if the distributions only shift in mean and covariance scale in Gaussian data. We find that these theoretical conditions hold when deep networks are adapted to CIFAR10-C data --- models embed the initial data distribution, with complex shifts, into those only with a singular ``scaling'' variable in the feature space. Building on these stronger linear trends, we demonstrate that combining TTA and AGL-based methods can predict the OOD performance with higher precision than previous methods for a broader set of distribution shifts. Furthermore, we discover that models adapted with different hyperparameters settings exhibit the same linear trends. This allows us to perform hyperparameter selection on OOD data without relying on any labeled data.

Test-time Adaptation in Non-stationary Environments via Adaptive Representation Alignment
Adapting to distribution changes is a critical challenge in modern machine learning. Due to streaming nature of data, the data is usually unlabeled and naturally have continuously distribution change. To this end, we investigate the problem of sequentially adapting the model to non-stationary environments, where the data distribution is continuously shifting and only a few unlabeled data are available each time. Continual test-time adaptation methods have shown promising results in reliable pseudo label generation, while still lack exploration of representation learning in non-stationary environments. In this paper, we propose using non-stationary representation learning to adaptively align the unlabeled data stream with changing distributions to the source data representation, by leveraging a sketch of source labeled data. To alleviate the data scarcity in non-stationary representation learning, we propose a novel two-layer adaptive learning algorithm, Ada-ReAlign, that uses a group of base learner to explore varying lengths of the unlabeled data stream and adaptively combined with a meta learner to deal with the unknown and continuously changing data distribution with theoretical guarantees. Experiments on both benchmark datasets and a real-world application validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and the adaptive representation alignment mechanism.

Test-Time Dynamic Image Fusion
The inherent challenge of image fusion lies in capturing the correlation of multi-source images and comprehensively integrating effective information from different sources. Most existing techniques fail to perform dynamic image fusion while notably lacking theoretical guarantees, leading to potential deployment risks in this field. Is it possible to conduct dynamic image fusion with a clear theoretical justification? In this paper, we give our solution from a generalization perspective. We proceed to reveal the generalized form of image fusion and derive a new test-time dynamic image fusion paradigm. It provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error. Specifically, we decompose the fused image into multiple components corresponding to its source data. The decomposed components represent10the effective information from the source data, thus the gap between them reflects the Relative Dominability (RD) of the uni-source data in constructing the fusion image. Theoretically, we prove that the key to reducing generalization error hinges on the negative correlation between the RD-based fusion weight and the uni-source reconstruction loss. Intuitively, RD dynamically highlights the dominant regions of each source and can be naturally converted to the corresponding fusion weight, achieving robust results. Extensive experiments and discussions with in-depth analysis on multiple benchmarks confirm our findings and superiority. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TTD-843E.

Tetrahedron Splatting for 3D Generation
3D representation is essential to the significant advance of 3D generation with 2D diffusion priors. As a flexible representation, NeRF has been first adopted for 3D representation. With density-based volumetric rendering, it however suffers both intensive computational overhead and inaccurate mesh extraction. Using a signed distance field and Marching Tetrahedra, DMTet allows for precise mesh extraction and real-time rendering but is limited in handling large topological changes in meshes, leading to optimization challenges. Alternatively, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is favored in both training and rendering efficiency while falling short in mesh extraction. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D representation, Tetrahedron Splatting (TeT-Splatting), that supports easy convergence during optimization, precise mesh extraction, and real-time rendering simultaneously. This is achieved by integrating surface-based volumetric rendering within a structured tetrahedral grid while preserving the desired ability of precise mesh extraction, and a tile-based differentiable tetrahedron rasterizer. Furthermore, we incorporate eikonal and normal consistency regularization terms for the signed distance field to improve generation quality and stability. Critically, our representation can be trained without mesh extraction, making the optimization process easier to converge. Our TeT-Splatting can be readily integrated in existing 3D generation pipelines, along with polygonal mesh for texture optimization. Extensive experiments show that our TeT-Splatting strikes a superior tradeoff among convergence speed, render efficiency, and mesh quality as compared to previous alternatives under varying 3D generation settings.

Text2CAD: Generating Sequential CAD Designs from Beginner-to-Expert Level Text Prompts
Prototyping complex computer-aided design (CAD) models in modern softwares can be very time-consuming. This is due to the lack of intelligent systems that can quickly generate simpler intermediate parts. We propose Text2CAD, the first AI framework for generating text-to-parametric CAD models using designer-friendly instructions for all skill levels. Furthermore we introduce a data annotation pipeline for generating text prompts based on natural language instructions for the DeepCAD dataset using Mistral and LLaVA-NeXT. The dataset contains ~$170$K models and ~$660$K text annotations, from abstract CAD descriptions (e.g., generate two concentric cylinders) to detailed specifications (e.g., draw two circles with center $(x,y)$ and radius $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$, and extrude along the normal by $d$...). Within the Text2CAD framework, we propose an end-to-end transformer based auto-regressive network to generate parametric CAD models from input texts. We evaluate the performance of our model through a mixture of metrics, including visual quality, parametric precision, and geometrical accuracy. Our analysis shows great potential in AI-aided design applications. Our source code and annotations will be publicly available.

TextCtrl: Diffusion-based Scene Text Editing with Prior Guidance Control
Centred on content modification and style preservation, Scene Text Editing (STE) remains a challenging task despite considerable progress in text-to-image synthesis and text-driven image manipulation recently. GAN-based STE methods generally encounter a common issue of model generalization, while Diffusion-based STE methods suffer from undesired style deviations. To address these problems, we propose TextCtrl, a diffusion-based method that edits text with prior guidance control. Our method consists of two key components: (i) By constructing fine-grained text style disentanglement and robust text glyph structure representation,  TextCtrl explicitly incorporates Style-Structure guidance into model design and network training, significantly improving text style consistency and rendering accuracy. (ii) To further leverage the style prior, a Glyph-adaptive Mutual Self-attention mechanism is proposed which deconstructs the implicit fine-grained features of the source image to enhance style consistency and vision quality during inference. Furthermore, to fill the vacancy of the real-world STE evaluation benchmark, we create the first real-world image-pair dataset termed ScenePair for fair comparisons. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TextCtrl compared with previous methods concerning both style fidelity and text accuracy. Dataset and code will be available.

Text-DiFuse: An Interactive Multi-Modal Image Fusion Framework based on Text-modulated Diffusion Model
Existing multi-modal image fusion methods fail to address the compound degradations presented in source images, resulting in fusion images plagued by noise, color bias, improper exposure, etc. Additionally, these methods often overlook the specificity of foreground objects, weakening the salience of the objects of interest within the fused images. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel interactive multi-modal image fusion framework based on the text-modulated diffusion model, called Text-DiFuse. First, this framework integrates feature-level information integration into the diffusion process, allowing adaptive degradation removal and multi-modal information fusion. This is the first attempt to deeply and explicitly embed information fusion within the diffusion process, effectively addressing compound degradation in image fusion. Second, by embedding the combination of the text and zero-shot location model into the diffusion fusion process, a text-controlled fusion re-modulation strategy is developed. This enables user-customized text control to improve fusion performance and highlight foreground objects in the fused images. Extensive experiments on diverse public datasets show that our Text-DiFuse achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance across various scenarios with complex degradation. Moreover, the semantic segmentation experiment validates the significant enhancement in semantic performance achieved by our text-controlled fusion re-modulation strategy.

Text-Guided Image Editing in Around 7 Steps with Invertible Consistency Distillation
Diffusion distillation represents a highly promising direction for achieving faithful text-to-image generation in a few sampling steps. However, despite recent successes, existing distilled models still do not provide the full spectrum of diffusion abilities, such as real image inversion, which enables many precise image manipulation methods. This work aims to enrich distilled text-to-image diffusion models with the ability to effectively encode real images into their latent space. To this end, we introduce invertible Consistency Distillation (iCD), a generalized consistency distillation framework that facilitates both high-quality image synthesis and accurate image inversion in only 3-4 inference steps. Though the inversion problem for text-to-image diffusion models gets exacerbated by high classifier-free guidance scales, we notice that dynamic guidance significantly reduces reconstruction errors without noticeable degradation in generation performance. As a result, we demonstrate that iCD equipped with dynamic guidance may serve as a highly effective tool for zero-shot text-guided image editing, competing with more expensive state-of-the-art alternatives.

Text-space Graph Foundation Models: Comprehensive Benchmarks and New Insights
Given the ubiquity of graph data and its applications in diverse domains, building a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that can work well across different graphs and tasks with a unified backbone has recently garnered significant interests. A major obstacle to achieving this goal stems from the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit diverse node features. Inspired by multi-modal models that align different modalities with natural language, the text has recently been adopted to provide a unified feature space for diverse graphs. Despite the great potential of these text-space GFMs, current research in this field is hampered by two problems. First, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark with unified problem settings hinders a clear understanding of the comparative effectiveness and practical value of different text-space GFMs. Second, there is a lack of sufficient datasets to thoroughly explore the methods' full potential and verify their effectiveness across diverse settings. To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark providing novel text-space datasets and comprehensive evaluation under unified problem settings. Empirical results provide new insights and inspire future research directions. Our code and data are publicly available from https://github.com/CurryTang/TSGFM.

TFGDA: Exploring Topology and Feature Alignment in Semi-supervised Graph Domain Adaptation through Robust Clustering
Semi-supervised graph domain adaptation, as a branch of graph transfer learning, aims to annotate unlabeled target graph nodes by utilizing transferable knowledge learned from a label-scarce source graph. However, most existing studies primarily concentrate on aligning feature distributions directly to extract domain-invariant features, while ignoring the utilization of the intrinsic structure information in graphs. Inspired by the significance of data structure information in enhancing models' generalization performance, this paper aims to investigate how to leverage the structure information to assist graph transfer learning. To this end, we propose an innovative framework called TFGDA. Specially, TFGDA employs a structure alignment strategy named STSA to encode graphs' topological structure information into the latent space, greatly facilitating the learning of transferable features. To achieve a stable alignment of feature distributions, we also introduce a SDA strategy to mitigate domain discrepancy on the sphere. Moreover, to address the overfitting issue caused by label scarcity, a simple but effective RNC strategy is devised to guide the discriminative clustering of unlabeled nodes. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of TFGDA over SOTA methods.

TFG: Unified Training-Free Guidance for Diffusion Models
Given an unconditional diffusion model and a predictor for a target property of interest (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. Existing methods, though effective in various individual applications, often lack theoretical grounding and rigorous testing on extensive benchmarks. As a result, they could even fail on simple tasks, and applying them to a new problem becomes unavoidably difficult. This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework that encompasses existing methods as special cases, unifying the study of training-free guidance into the analysis of an algorithm-agnostic design space. Via theoretical and empirical investigation, we propose an efficient and effective hyper-parameter searching strategy that can be readily applied to any downstream task. We systematically benchmark training-free guidance across 6 diffusion models on 14 tasks with 38 targets, and achieve a 7.4% performance improvement on average. We believe our framework and benchmark offer a solid foundation for future research in this area.

The Bayesian sampling in a canonical recurrent circuit with a diversity of inhibitory interneurons
Accumulating evidence suggests stochastic cortical circuits can perform sampling-based Bayesian inference to compute the latent  stimulus posterior. Canonical cortical circuits consist of excitatory (E) neurons and types of inhibitory (I) interneurons. Nevertheless, nearly no sampling neural circuit models consider the diversity of interneurons, and thus how interneurons contribute to sampling remains poorly understood. To provide theoretical insight, we build a nonlinear canonical circuit model consisting of recurrently connected E neurons and two types of I neurons including Parvalbumin (PV) and Somatostatin (SOM) neurons. The E neurons are modeled as a canonical ring (attractor) model, receiving global inhibition from PV neurons, and locally tuning-dependent inhibition from SOM neurons. We theoretically analyze the nonlinear circuit dynamics and analytically identify the Bayesian sampling algorithm performed by the circuit dynamics. We found a reduced circuit with only E and PV neurons performs Langevin sampling, and the inclusion of SOM neurons with tuning-dependent inhibition speeds up the sampling via upgrading the Langevin into Hamiltonian sampling,  Moreover, the Hamiltonian framework requires SOM neurons receive no direct feedforward connections, consistent with neuroanatomy.  Our work provides overarching connections between nonlinear circuits with various types of interneurons and sampling algorithms, deepening our understanding of circuit implementation of Bayesian inference.

The Benefits of Balance: From Information Projections to Variance Reduction
Data balancing across multiple modalities/sources appears in various forms in several foundation models (e.g., CLIP and DINO) achieving universal representation learning. We show that this iterative algorithm, usually used to avoid representation collapse, enjoys an unsuspected benefit: reducing the variance of empirical functionals of the distribution over these sources. We provide non-asymptotic bounds quantifying this variance reduction effect and relate them to the eigendecays of appropriately defined Markov operators. We explain how various forms of data balancing in contrastive multimodal learning and self-supervised clustering can be interpreted as instances of this variance reduction scheme.

The Best of Both Worlds: On the Dilemma of Out-of-distribution Detection
Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for model trustworthiness which aims to sensitively identity semantic OOD samples and robustly generalize for covariate-shifted OOD samples. However, we discover that the superior OOD detection performance of state-of-the-art methods is achieved by secretly sacrificing the OOD generalization ability. The classification accuracy frequently collapses catastrophically when even slight noise is encountered. Such a phenomenon violates the motivation of trustworthiness and significantly limits the model's deployment in the real world. What is the hidden reason behind such a limitation? In this work, we theoretically demystify the "\textit{sensitive-robust}" dilemma that lies in previous OOD detection methods. Consequently, a theory-inspired algorithm is induced to overcome such a dilemma. By decoupling the uncertainty learning objective from a Bayesian perspective, the conflict between OOD detection and OOD generalization is naturally harmonized and a dual-optimized performance could be expected. Empirical studies show that our method achieves superior performance on commonly used benchmarks. To our best knowledge, this work is the first principled OOD detection method that achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without sacrificing OOD generalization ability. Our code is available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DUL_NIPS-631B}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DUL}.

The Collusion of Memory and Nonlinearity in Stochastic Approximation With Constant Stepsize
In this work, we investigate stochastic approximation (SA) with Markovian data and nonlinear updates under constant stepsize $\alpha>0$.  Existing work has primarily focused on either i.i.d. data or linear update rules. We take a new perspective and carefully examine the simultaneous presence of Markovian dependency of data and nonlinear update rules, delineating how the interplay between these two structures leads to complications that are not captured by prior techniques. By leveraging the smoothness and recurrence properties of the SA updates, we develop a fine-grained analysis of the correlation between the SA iterates $\theta_k$ and Markovian data $x_k$. This enables us to overcome the obstacles in existing analysis and establish for the first time the weak convergence of the joint process $(x_k, \theta_k)$. Furthermore, we present a precise characterization of the asymptotic bias of the SA iterates, given by $\mathbb{E}[\theta_\infty]-\theta^\ast=\alpha(b_\textup{m}+b_\textup{n}+b_\textup{c})+\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{3/2})$. Here, $b_\textup{m}$ is associated with the Markovian noise, $b_\textup{n}$ is tied to the nonlinearity, and notably, $b_\textup{c}$ represents a multiplicative interaction between the Markovian noise and nonlinearity, which is absent in previous works. As a by-product of our analysis, we derive finite-time bounds on higher moment $\mathbb{E}[||\theta_k-\theta^\ast||^{2p}]$ and present non-asymptotic geometric convergence rates for the iterates, along with a Central Limit Theorem.

The Convergence of Variance Exploding Diffusion Models under the Manifold Hypothesis
Variance exploding (VE) based diffusion models, an important class of diffusion models, have shown state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, only a few theoretical works analyze VE-based models, and those works suffer from a worse forward convergence rate $1/\text{poly}(T)$ than the $\exp{(-T)}$ of variance preserving (VP) based models, where $T$ is the forward diffusion time and the rate measures the distance between forward marginal distribution $q_T$ and pure Gaussian noise. The slow rate is due to the Brownian Motion without a drift term. In this work, we design a new drifted VESDE forward process, which allows a faster $\exp{(-T)}$ forward convergence rate. With this process, we achieve the first polynomial sample complexity for a series of VE-based models with reverse SDE under the manifold hypothesis. Furthermore, unlike previous works, we allow the diffusion coefficient to be unbounded instead of a constant, which is closer to the SOTA models. Besides the reverse SDE, the other common reverse process is the probability flow ODE  (PFODE) process, which is deterministic and enjoys faster sample speed. To deepen the understanding of VE-based models, we consider a more general setting considering reverse SDE and PFODE simultaneously, propose an unified tangent-based analysis framework, and prove the first quantitative convergence guarantee for SOTA VE-based models with reverse PFODE.We also show that the drifted VESDE can balance different error terms and improve generated samples without training through synthetic experiments.

The Edge-of-Reach Problem in Offline Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to train agents from pre-collected datasets. However, this comes with the added challenge of estimating the value of behavior not covered in the dataset. Model-based methods offer a potential solution by training an approximate dynamics model, which then allows collection of additional synthetic data via rollouts in this model. The prevailing theory treats this approach as online RL in an approximate dynamics model, and any remaining performance gap is therefore understood as being due to dynamics model errors. In this paper, we analyze this assumption and investigate how popular algorithms perform as the learned dynamics model is improved. Surprisingly - and in contrast to both intuition and theory - if the learned dynamics model is replaced by the true error-free dynamics, existing model-based methods completely fail. This reveals a key oversight: The theoretical foundations assume sampling of full horizon rollouts in the learned dynamics model; however, in practice, the number of model-rollout steps is aggressively reduced to prevent accumulating errors. We show that this truncation of rollouts results in a set of edge-of-reach states at which we are effectively "bootstrapping from the void." This triggers pathological value overestimation and complete performance collapse. We term this the edge-of-reach problem. Based on this new insight, we fill important gaps in existing theory, and reveal how prior model-based methods are primarily addressing the edge-of-reach problem, rather than model-inaccuracy as claimed. Finally, we propose Reach-Aware Value Learning (RAVL), a simple and robust method that directly addresses the edge-of-reach problem and hence - unlike existing methods - does not fail as the dynamics model is improved. Since world models will inevitably improve, we believe this is a key step towards future-proofing offline RL.

The Empirical Impact of Neural Parameter Symmetries, or Lack Thereof
Many algorithms and observed phenomena in deep learning appear to be affected by parameter symmetries --- transformations of neural network parameters that do not change the underlying neural network function. These include linear mode connectivity, model merging, Bayesian neural network inference, metanetworks, and several other characteristics of optimization or loss-landscapes. However, theoretical analysis of the relationship between parameter space symmetries and these phenonmena is difficult. In this work, we empirically investigate the impact of neural parameter symmetries by introducing new neural network architectures that have reduced parameter space symmetries. We develop two methods, with some provable guarantees, of modifying standard neural networks to reduce parameter space symmetries.  With these new methods, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study consisting of multiple tasks aimed at assessing the effect of removing parameter symmetries. Our experiments reveal several interesting observations on the empirical impact of parameter symmetries; for instance, we observe linear mode connectivity between our networks without alignment of weight spaces, and we find that our networks allow for faster and more effective Bayesian neural network training.

The Expressive Capacity of State Space Models: A Formal Language Perspective
Recently, recurrent models based on linear state space models  (SSMs) have shown promising performance in language modeling (LM), competititve with transformers. However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.

The Fairness-Quality Tradeoff in Clustering
Fairness in clustering has been considered extensively in the past; however, the trade-off between the two objectives --- e.g., can we sacrifice just a little in the quality of the clustering to significantly increase fairness, or vice-versa? --- has rarely been addressed. We introduce novel algorithms for tracing the complete trade-off curve, or Pareto front, between quality and fairness in clustering problems; that is, computing all clusterings that are not dominated in both objectives by other clusterings. Unlike previous work that deals with specific objectives for quality and fairness, we deal with all objectives for fairness and quality in two general classes encompassing most of the special cases addressed in previous work. Our algorithm must take exponential time in the worst case as the Parero front itself can be exponential. Even when the Pareto front is polynomial, our algorithm may take exponential time, and we prove that this is inevitable unless P = NP. However, we also present a new polynomial-time algorithm for computing the entire Pareto front when the cluster centers are fixed, and for perhaps the most natural fairness objective: minimizing the sum, over all clusters, of the imbalance between the two groups in each cluster.

The Feature Speed Formula: a flexible approach to scale hyper-parameters of deep neural networks
Deep learning succeeds by doing hierarchical feature learning, yet tuning Hyper-Parameters (HP) such as initialization scales, learning rates etc., only give indirect control over this behavior. In this paper, we introduce a key notion to predict and control feature learning: the angle $\theta_\ell$ between the feature updates and the backward pass (at layer index $\ell$). We show that the magnitude of feature updates after one GD step, at any training time, can be expressed via a simple and general \emph{feature speed formula} in terms of this angle $\theta_\ell$, the loss decay, and the magnitude of the backward pass. This angle $\theta_\ell$ is controlled by the conditioning of the layer-to-layer Jacobians and at random initialization, it is determined by the spectrum of a certain kernel, which coincides with the Neural Tangent Kernel when $\ell=\text{depth}$. Given $\theta_\ell$, the feature speed formula provides us with rules to adjust HPs (scales and learning rates) so as to satisfy certain dynamical properties, such as feature learning and loss decay. We investigate the implication of our approach to ReLU MLPs and ResNets in the large width-then-depth limit. Relying on prior work, we show that in ReLU MLPs with iid initialization, the angle degenerates with depth as $\cos(\theta_\ell)=\Theta(1/\sqrt{\ell})$. In contrast, ResNets with branch scale  $O(1/\sqrt{\text{depth}})$ maintain a non-degenerate angle $\cos(\theta_\ell)=\Theta(1)$. We use these insights to recover key properties of known HP scalings (such as $\mu$P), and also introduce a new HP scaling for large depth ReLU MLPs with favorable theoretical properties.

The GAN is dead; long live the GAN! A Modern GAN Baseline
There is a widely-spread claim that GANs are difficult to train, and GAN architectures in the literature are littered with empirical tricks. We provide evidence against this claim and build a modern GAN baseline in a more principled manner. First, we derive a well-behaved regularized relativistic GAN loss that addresses issues of mode dropping and non-convergence that were previously tackled via a bag of ad-hoc tricks. We analyze our loss mathematically and prove that it admits local convergence guarantees, unlike most existing relativistic losses. Second, our new loss allows us to discard all ad-hoc tricks and replace outdated backbones used in common GANs with modern architectures. Using StyleGAN2 as an example, we present a roadmap of simplification and modernization that results in a new minimalist baseline---R3GAN. Despite being simple, our approach surpasses StyleGAN2 on FFHQ, ImageNet, CIFAR, and Stacked MNIST datasets, and compares favorably against state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models.

The Group Robustness is in the Details: Revisiting Finetuning under Spurious Correlations
Modern machine learning models are prone to over-reliance on spurious correlations, which can often lead to poor performance on minority groups. In this paper, we identify surprising and nuanced behavior of finetuned models on worst-group accuracy via comprehensive experiments on four well-established benchmarks across vision and language tasks. We first show that the commonly used approach of class-balanced mini-batch finetuning can induce a decrease in worst-group accuracy (WGA) with training epochs, leading to performance no better than without class-balancing. While in some scenarios, removing data to create a class-balanced subset is more effective, we show this depends on group structure and propose a mixture method which can outperform both techniques. Next, we show that scaling pretrained models is generally beneficial for worst-group accuracy, but only in conjuction with appropriate class-balancing. Finally, we identify spectral imbalance in finetuning features as a potential source of group disparities --- minority group covariances incur a larger spectral norm than majority groups once conditioned on the classes. Our results show more nuanced interactions of modern finetuned models with group robustness than was previously known.

The High Line: Exact Risk and Learning Rate Curves of Stochastic Adaptive Learning Rate Algorithms
We develop a framework for analyzing the training and learning rate dynamics on a large class of high-dimensional optimization problems, which we call the high line, trained using one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with adaptive learning rates. We give exact expressions for the risk and learning rate curves in terms of a deterministic solution to a system of ODEs. We then investigate in detail two adaptive learning rates  -- an idealized exact line search and AdaGrad-Norm -- on the least squares problem. When the data covariance matrix has strictly positive eigenvalues, this idealized exact line search strategy can exhibit arbitrarily slower convergence when compared to the optimal fixed learning rate with SGD. Moreover we exactly characterize the limiting learning rate (as time goes to infinity) for line search in the setting where the data covariance has only two distinct eigenvalues. For noiseless targets, we further demonstrate that the AdaGrad-Norm learning rate converges to a deterministic constant inversely proportional to the average eigenvalue of the data covariance matrix, and identify a phase transition when the covariance density of eigenvalues follows a power law distribution.

The Impact of Initialization on the Finetuning Dynamics in LoRA
In this paper, we study the role of initialization in Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as originally introduced in Hu et al. (2021). Essentially, to start from the pretrained model, one can either initialize $B$ to zero and $A$ to random, or vice-versa. In both cases, the product $BA$ is equal to zero at initialization, which makes finetuning starts from the pretrained model. These two initialization schemes are seemingly similar. They should in-principle yield the same performance and share the same optimal learning rate. We demonstrate that this is a *wrong intuition* and that the first scheme (of initializing $B$ to zero and $A$ to random) on average in our experiments yields better performance compared to the other scheme. Our theoretical analysis shows that the reason behind this might be that the first initialization allows the use of larger learning rates (without causing output instability) compared to the second initialization, resulting in more efficient learning of the first scheme. We validate our results with extensive experiments.

The Implicit Bias of Gradient Descent on Separable Multiclass Data
Implicit regularization describes the phenomenon where optimization-based training algorithms, without explicit regularization, show a preference for simple estimators even when more complex estimators have equal objective values. Multiple works have developed the theory of implicit regularization for binary classification under the assumption that the loss satisfies an *exponential tail property*. However, there is a noticeable gap in analysis for multiclass classification, with only a handful of results which themselves are restricted to the cross-entropy loss. In this work, we employ the framework of Permutation Equivariant and Relative Margin-based (PERM) losses [Wang and Scott, 2024] to introduce a multiclass extension of the exponential tail property. This class of losses includes not only cross-entropy but also other losses. Using this framework, we extend the implicit bias result of Soudry et al. [2018] to multiclass classification. Furthermore, our proof techniques closely mirror those of the binary case, thus illustrating the power of the PERM framework for bridging the binary-multiclass gap.

The Implicit Bias of Gradient Descent toward Collaboration between Layers: A Dynamic Analysis of Multilayer Perceptions
The implicit bias of gradient descent has long been considered the most likely mechanism that explains the superior generalization of over-parameterized neural networks without over-fitting, even when the training error is zero. Adversarial robustness is another key focus of research since it is crucial for the \textit{trustworthiness} of a model. A recent paper targets both generalization and adversarial robustness, concluding that implicit bias leads to non-robust solutions~\cite{frei2023double}. However, it does not account for the different behaviours of \textit{under-parameterized} and \textit{over-parameterized} neural networks concerning their implicit bias. In this paper, we dive into this trade-off, revealing those different behaviours through collaboration between consecutive layers. We quantify the collaboration between layers by a new concept named \textit{Co-correlation} which can be interpreted as \textit{alignment} of feature selections concerning maximizing outputs for each layer. We conducted extensive experiments that verified our proposed framework.

The Implicit Bias of Heterogeneity towards Invariance: A Study of Multi-Environment Matrix Sensing
Models are expected to engage in invariance learning, which involves distinguishing the core relations that remain consistent across varying environments to ensure the predictions are safe, robust and fair. While existing works consider specific algorithms to realize invariance learning, we show that model has the potential to learn invariance through standard training procedures. In other words, this paper studies the implicit bias of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) over heterogeneous data and shows that the implicit bias drives the model learning towards an invariant solution. We call the phenomenon the implicit invariance learning. Specifically, we theoretically investigate the multi-environment low-rank matrix sensing problem where in each environment, the signal comprises (i) a lower-rank invariant part shared across all environments; and (ii) a significantly varying environment-dependent spurious component. The key insight is, through simply employing the large step size large-batch SGD sequentially in each environment without any explicit regularization, the oscillation caused by heterogeneity can provably prevent model learning spurious signals.  The model reaches the invariant solution after certain iterations. In contrast, model learned using pooled GD over all data would simultaneously learn both the invariant and spurious signals.In summary, we unveil another implicit bias that is a result of the symbiosis between the heterogeneity of data and modern algorithms, which is, to the best of our knowledge, first in the literature.

The Intelligible and Effective Graph Neural Additive Network
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for learning over graph-structured data.  However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial.In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design.  Our model,  Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models,  and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, allowing both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe the exact way the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.

The Iterative Optimal Brain Surgeon: Faster Sparse Recovery by Leveraging Second-Order Information
The rising footprint of machine learning has led to a focus on imposing model sparsity as a means of reducing computational and memory costs. For deep neural networks (DNNs), the state-of-the-art accuracy-vs-sparsity is achieved by heuristics inspired by the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) framework [LeCun et al., 1989, Hassibi and Stork, 1992, Hassibi et al., 1993], which leverages loss curvature information to make better pruning decisions. Yet, these results still lack a solid theoretical understanding, and it is unclear whether they can be improved by leveraging connections to the wealth of work on sparse recovery algorithms. In this paper, we draw new connections between these two areas and present new sparse recovery algorithms inspired by the OBS framework that come with theoretical guarantees under reasonable assumptions and have strong practical performance. Specifically, our work starts from the observation that we can leverage curvature information in OBS-like fashion upon the projection step of classic iterative sparse recovery algorithms such as IHT. We show for the first time that this leads both to improved convergence bounds in well-behaved settings and to stronger practical convergence. Furthermore, we present extensions of this approach to training accurate sparse DNNs, and validate it experimentally at scale.

The Mamba in the Llama: Distilling and Accelerating Hybrid Models
Recent research suggests that state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba can be competitive with Transformer models for language modeling with advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus and expertise on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models into SSMs for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into SSMs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of state-space models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can distill a large Transformer into a hybrid SSM and decode it efficiently.

The Minimax Rate of HSIC Estimation for Translation-Invariant Kernels
Kernel techniques are among the most influential approaches in data science and statistics. Under mild conditions, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated to a kernel is capable of encoding the independence of $M\ge2$ random variables. Probably the most widespread independence measure relying on kernels is the so-called Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC; also referred to as distance covariance in the statistics literature). Despite various existing HSIC estimators designed since its introduction close to two decades ago, the fundamental question of the rate at which HSIC can be estimated is still open. In this work, we prove that the minimax optimal rate of HSIC estimation on $\mathbb{R}^d$ for Borel measures containing the Gaussians with continuous bounded translation-invariant  characteristic  kernels  is $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-1/2}\right)$. Specifically, our result implies the optimality in the minimax sense of many of the most-frequently used estimators (including the U-statistic, the V-statistic, and the Nyström-based one) on $\mathbb{R}^d$.

The motion planning neural circuit in goal-directed navigation as Lie group operator search
The information processing in the brain and embodied agents form a sensory-action loop to interact with the world. An important step in the loop is motion planning which selects motor actions based on the current world state and task need. In goal-directed navigation, the brain chooses and generates motor actions to bring the current state into the goal state. It is unclear about the neural circuit mechanism of motor action selection, nor its underlying theory. The present study formulates the motion planning as a Lie group operator search problem, and uses the 1D rotation group as an example to provide insight into general operator search in neural circuits. We found the abstract group operator search can be implemented by a two-layer feedforward circuit utilizing circuit motifs of connection phase shift, nonlinear activation function, and pooling, similar to Drosophila's goal-directed navigation neural circuits. And the computational complexity of the feedforward circuit is even lower than common signal processing algorithms in certain conditions. We also provide geometric interpretations of circuit computation in the group representation space. The feedforward motion planning circuit is further combined with sensory and motor circuit modules into a full circuit of the sensory-action loop implementing goal-directed navigation. Our work for the first time links the abstract operator search with biological neural circuits.

Theoretical and Empirical Insights into the Origins of Degree Bias in Graph Neural Networks
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often perform better for high-degree nodes than low-degree nodes on node classification tasks. This degree bias can reinforce social marginalization by, e.g., privileging celebrities and other high-degree actors in social networks during social and content recommendation. While researchers have proposed numerous hypotheses for why GNN degree bias occurs, we find via a survey of 38 degree bias papers that these hypotheses are often not rigorously validated, and can even be contradictory. Thus, we provide an analysis of the origins of degree bias in message-passing GNNs with different graph filters. We prove that high-degree test nodes tend to have a lower probability of misclassification regardless of how GNNs are trained. Moreover, we show that degree bias arises from a variety of factors that are associated with a node's degree (e.g., homophily of neighbors, diversity of neighbors). Furthermore, we show that during training, some GNNs may adjust their loss on low-degree nodes more slowly than on high-degree nodes; however, with sufficiently many epochs of training, message-passing GNNs can achieve their maximum possible training accuracy, which is not significantly limited by their expressive power. Throughout our analysis, we connect our findings to previously-proposed hypotheses for the origins of degree bias, supporting and unifying some while drawing doubt to others. We validate our theoretical findings on 8 common real-world networks, and based on our theoretical and empirical insights, describe a roadmap to alleviate degree bias.

Theoretical Characterisation of the Gauss Newton Conditioning in Neural Networks
The Gauss-Newton (GN) matrix plays an important role in machine learning, most evident in its use as a preconditioning matrix for a wide family of popular adaptive methods to speed up optimization. Besides, it can  also provide key insights into the optimization landscape of neural networks. In the context of deep neural networks, understanding the GN matrix involves studying the interaction between different weight matrices as well as the dependencies introduced by the data, thus rendering its analysis challenging.In this work, we take a first step towards theoretically characterizing the conditioning of the GN matrix in neural networks. We establish tight bounds on the condition number of the GN in deep linear networks of arbitrary depth and width, which we also extend to two-layer ReLU networks.We expand the analysis to further architectural components, such as residual connections and convolutional layers. Finally, we empirically validate the bounds and uncover valuable insights into the influence of the analyzed architectural components.

Theoretical Foundations of Deep Selective State-Space Models
Structured state-space models (SSMs) are gaining popularity as effective foundational architectures for sequential data, demonstrating outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains alongside desirable scalability properties. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for a selectivity mechanism leveraging multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. Mamba, GLA, Hawk/Griffin, HGRN2), then the resulting architecture can surpass attention-powered foundation models trained on text in both accuracy and efficiency, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to the selectivity mechanism, often linked to in-context learning, using tools from Rough Path Theory. We provide a framework for the theoretical analysis of generalized selective SSMs, fully characterizing their expressive power and identifying the gating mechanism as the crucial architectural choice. Our analysis provides a closed-form description of the expressive powers of modern SSMs, such as Mamba, quantifying theoretically the drastic improvement in performance from the previous generation of models, such as S4. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models, but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants. In particular, it suggests cross-channel interactions could play a vital role in future improvements.

Theoretical guarantees in KL for Diffusion Flow Matching
Flow Matching (FM) (also referred to as stochastic interpolants or rectified flows)  stands out as a class of generative models that aims to bridge in finite time the target distribution $\nu^\star$ with an auxiliary distribution $\mu$ leveraging a fixed coupling $\pi$ and a bridge which can either be deterministic or stochastic. These two ingredients define a path measure which can then be approximated by learning the drift of its Markovian projection. The main contribution of this paper is to provide relatively mild assumption on $\nu^\star$, $\mu$ and $\pi$ to obtain non-asymptotics guarantees for Diffusion Flow Matching (DFM) models using as bridge the conditional distribution associated with the Brownian motion. More precisely, it establishes bounds on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the target distribution and the one generated by such DFM models under moment conditions on the score of $\nu^\star$, $\mu$ and $\pi$, and a standard $\mathrm{L}^2$-drift-approximation error assumption.

Theoretical Investigations and Practical Enhancements on Tail Task Risk Minimization in Meta Learning
Meta learning is a promising paradigm in the era of large models and task distributional robustness has become an indispensable consideration in real-world scenarios.Recent advances have examined the effectiveness of tail task risk minimization in fast adaptation robustness improvement \citep{wang2023simple}.This work contributes to more theoretical investigations and practical enhancements in the field.Specifically, we reduce the distributionally robust strategy to a max-min optimization problem, constitute the Stackelberg equilibrium as the solution concept, and estimate the convergence rate.In the presence of tail risk, we further derive the generalization bound, establish connections with estimated quantiles, and practically improve the studied strategy.Accordingly, extensive evaluations demonstrate the significance of our proposal in boosting robustness.

The Poisson Midpoint Method for Langevin Dynamics: Provably Efficient Discretization for Diffusion Models
Langevin Dynamics is a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) central to sampling and generative modeling and is implemented via time discretization. Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), based on the Euler-Maruyama discretization, is the simplest and most studied algorithm. LMC can suffer from slow convergence - requiring a large number of steps of small step-size to obtain good quality samples. This becomes stark in the case of diffusion models where a large number of steps gives the best samples, but the quality degrades rapidly with smaller number of steps. Randomized Midpoint Method has been recently proposed as a better discretization of Langevin dynamics for sampling from strongly log-concave distributions. However, important applications such as diffusion models involve non-log concave densities and contain time varying drift. We propose its variant, the Poisson Midpoint Method, which approximates a small step-size LMC with large step-sizes. We prove that this can obtain a quadratic speed up of LMC under very weak assumptions. We apply our method to diffusion models for image generation and show that it maintains the quality of DDPM with 1000 neural network calls with just 50-80 neural network calls and outperforms ODE based methods with similar compute.

The Prevalence of Neural Collapse in Neural Multivariate Regression
Recently it has been observed that neural networks exhibit Neural Collapse (NC) during the final stage of training for the classification problem. We empirically show that multivariate regression, as employed in imitation learning and other applications, exhibits Neural Regression Collapse (NRC), a new form of neural collapse: (NRC1) The last-layer feature vectors collapse to the subspace spanned by the $n$ principal components of the feature vectors, where $n$ is the dimension of the targets (for univariate regression, $n=1$); (NRC2) The last-layer feature vectors also collapse to the subspace spanned by the last-layer weight vectors; (NRC3) The Gram matrix for the weight vectors converges to a specific functional form that depends on the covariance matrix of the targets. After empirically establishing the prevalence of (NRC1)-(NRC3) for a variety of datasets and network architectures, we provide an explanation of these phenomena by modeling the regression task in the context of the  Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM), in which the last layer feature vectors are treated as free variables when minimizing the loss function. We show that when the regularization parameters in the UFM model are strictly positive, then (NRC1)-(NRC3) also emerge as solutions in the UFM optimization problem. We also show that if the regularization parameters are equal to zero, then there is no collapse. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical and theoretical study of neural collapse in the context of regression. This extension is significant not only because it broadens the applicability of neural collapse to a new category of problems but also because it suggests that the phenomena of neural collapse could be a universal behavior in deep learning.

The Price of Implicit Bias in Adversarially Robust Generalization
We study the implicit bias of optimization in robust empirical risk minimization (robust ERM) and its connection with robust generalization.  In classification settings under adversarial perturbations with linear models, we study what type of regularization should ideally be applied for a given perturbation set to improve (robust) generalization. We then show that the implicit bias of optimization in robust ERM can significantly affect the robustness of the model and identify two ways this can happen; either through the optimization algorithm or the architecture. We verify our predictions in simulations with synthetic data and experimentally study the importance of implicit bias in robust ERM with deep neural networks.

The Reliability of OKRidge Method in Solving Sparse Ridge Regression Problems
Sparse ridge regression problems play a significant role across various domains. To solve sparse ridge regression, Liu et al. (2023) recently propose an advanced algorithm, Scalable Optimal $K$-Sparse Ridge Regression (OKRidge), which is both faster and more accurate than existing approaches. However, the absence of theoretical analysis on the error of OKRidge impedes its large-scale applications. In this paper, we reframe the estimation error of OKRidge as a Primary Optimization ($\textbf{PO}$) problem and employ the Convex Gaussian min-max theorem (CGMT) to simplify the $\textbf{PO}$ problem into an Auxiliary Optimization ($\textbf{AO}$) problem. Subsequently, we provide a theoretical error analysis for OKRidge based on the $\textbf{AO}$ problem. This error analysis improves the theoretical reliability of OKRidge. We also conduct experiments to verify our theorems and the results are in excellent agreement with our theoretical findings.

The Sample Complexity of Gradient Descent in Stochastic Convex Optimization
We analyze the sample complexity of full-batch Gradient Descent (GD) in the setup of non-smooth Stochastic Convex Optimization. We show that the generalization error of GD, with common choice of hyper-parameters, can be $\tilde \Theta(d/m+1/\sqrt{m})$, where d is the dimension and m is the sample size. This matches the sample complexity of \emph{worst-case} empirical risk minimizers. That means that, in contrast with other algorithms, GD has no advantage over naive ERMs. Our bound follows from a new generalization bound that depends on both the dimension as well as the learning rate and number of iterations. Our bound also shows that, for general hyper-parameters, when the dimension is strictly larger than number of samples, $T=\Omega(1/\epsilon^4)$ iterations are necessary to avoid overfitting. This resolves an open problem by Schlisserman et al.23 and Amir er Al.21, and improves over previous lower bounds that demonstrated that the sample size must be at least square root of the dimension.

The Secretary Problem with Predicted Additive Gap
The secretary problem is one of the fundamental problems in online decision making; a tight competitive ratio for this problem of $1/e \approx 0.368$ has been known since the 1960s. Much more recently, the study of algorithms with predictions was introduced: The algorithm is equipped with a (possibly erroneous) additional piece of information upfront which can be used to improve the algorithm's performance. Complementing previous work on secretary problems with prior knowledge, we tackle the following question: _What is the weakest piece of information that allows us to break the $1/e$ barrier?_To this end, we introduce the secretary problem with predicted additive gap. As in the classical problem, weights are fixed by an adversary and elements appear in random order. In contrast to previous variants of predictions, our algorithm only has access to a much weaker piece of information: an _additive gap_ $c$. This gap is the difference between the highest and $k$-th highest weight in the sequence.Unlike previous pieces of advice, knowing an exact additive gap does not make the problem trivial. Our contribution is twofold. First, we show that for any index $k$ and any gap $c$, we can obtain a competitive ratio of $0.4$ when knowing the exact gap (even if we do not know $k$), hence beating the prevalent bound for the classical problem by a constant. Second, a slightly modified version of our algorithm allows to prove standard robustness-consistency properties as well as improved guarantees when knowing a range for the error of the prediction.

The Selective $G$-Bispectrum and its Inversion: Applications to $G$-Invariant Networks
An important problem in signal processing and deep learning is to achieve *invariance* to nuisance factors not relevant for the task. Since many of these factors are describable as the action of a group $G$ (e.g. rotations, translations, scalings), we want methods to be $G$-invariant. The $G$-Bispectrum extracts every characteristic of a given signal up to group action: for example, the shape of an object in an image, but not its orientation. Consequently, the $G$-Bispectrum has been incorporated into deep neural network architectures as a computational primitive for $G$-invariance\textemdash akin to a pooling mechanism, but with greater selectivity and robustness. However, the computational cost of the $G$-Bispectrum ($\mathcal{O}(|G|^2)$, with $|G|$ the size of the group) has limited its widespread adoption. Here, we show that the $G$-Bispectrum computation contains redundancies that can be reduced into a *selective $G$-Bispectrum* with $\mathcal{O}(|G|)$ complexity. We prove desirable mathematical properties of the selective $G$-Bispectrum and demonstrate how its integration in neural networks enhances accuracy and robustness compared to traditional approaches, while enjoying considerable speeds-up compared to the full $G$-Bispectrum.

The Space Complexity of Approximating Logistic Loss
We provide space complexity lower bounds for data structures that approximate logistic loss up to $\epsilon$-relative error on a logistic regression problem with data $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and labels $\mathbf{y} \in \\{-1,1\\}^d$. The space complexity of existing coreset constructions depend on a natural complexity measure $\mu_\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{X})$. We give an $\tilde{\Omega}(\frac{d}{\epsilon^2})$ space complexity lower bound in the regime $\mu_\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{X}) = \mathcal{O}(1)$ that shows existing coresets are optimal in this regime up to lower order factors. We also prove a general $\tilde{\Omega}(d\cdot \mu_\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{X}))$ space lower bound when $\epsilon$ is constant, showing that the dependency on $\mu_\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{X})$ is not an artifact of mergeable coresets. Finally, we refute a prior conjecture that $\mu_\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{X})$ is hard to compute by providing an efficient linear programming formulation, and we empirically compare our algorithm to prior approximate methods.

The State of Data Curation at NeurIPS: An Assessment of Dataset Development Practices in the Datasets and Benchmarks Track
Data curation is a field with origins in librarianship and archives, whose scholarship and thinking on data issues go back centuries, if not millennia. The field of machine learning is increasingly observing the importance of data curation to the advancement of both applications and fundamental understanding of machine learning models – evidenced not least by the creation of the Datasets and Benchmarks track itself. This work provides an analysis of recent dataset development practices at NeurIPS through the lens of data curation. We present an evaluation framework for dataset documentation, consisting of a rubric and toolkit developed through a thorough literature review of data curation principles. We use the framework to systematically assess the strengths and weaknesses in current dataset development practices of 60 datasets published in the NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks track from 2021-2023. We summarize key findings and trends. Results indicate greater need for documentation about environmental footprint, ethical considerations, and data management. We suggest targeted strategies and resources to improve documentation in these areas and provide recommendations for the NeurIPS peer-review process that prioritize rigorous data curation in ML. We also provide guidelines for dataset developers on the use of our rubric as a standalone tool. Finally, we provide results in the format of a dataset that showcases aspects of recommended data curation practices. Our rubric and results are of interest for improving data curation practices broadly in the field of ML as well as to data curation and science and technology studies scholars studying practices in ML. Our aim is to support continued improvement in interdisciplinary research on dataset practices, ultimately improving the reusability and reproducibility of new datasets and benchmarks, enabling standardized and informed human oversight, and strengthening the foundation of rigorous and responsible ML research.

This Too Shall Pass: Removing Stale Observations in Dynamic Bayesian Optimization
Bayesian Optimization (BO) has proven to be very successful at optimizing a static, noisy, costly-to-evaluate black-box function $f : \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$. However, optimizing a black-box which is also a function of time (*i.e.*, a *dynamic* function) $f : \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{R}$ remains a challenge, since a dynamic Bayesian Optimization (DBO) algorithm has to keep track of the optimum over time. This changes the nature of the optimization problem in at least three aspects: (i) querying an arbitrary point in $\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{T}$ is impossible, (ii) past observations become less and less relevant for keeping track of the optimum as time goes by and (iii) the DBO algorithm must have a high sampling frequency so it can collect enough relevant observations to keep track of the optimum through time. In this paper, we design a Wasserstein distance-based criterion able to quantify the relevancy of an observation with respect to future predictions. Then, we leverage this criterion to build W-DBO, a DBO algorithm able to remove irrelevant observations from its dataset on the fly, thus maintaining simultaneously a good predictive performance and a high sampling frequency, even in continuous-time optimization tasks with unknown horizon. Numerical experiments establish the superiority of W-DBO, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a comfortable margin.

Tight Bounds for Learning RUMs from Small Slates
A Random Utility Model (RUM) is a classical model of user behavior defined by a distribution over $\mathbb{R}^n$. A user, presented with a subset of $\\{1,\ldots,n\\}$, will select the item of the subset with highest utility, according to a utility vector drawn from the distribution. In practical settings, the subset is often of small size, as in the ``ten blue links'' of web search. In this paper, we consider a learning setting with complete information on user choices from subsets of size at most $k$. We show that $k=\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ is necessary and sufficient to predict the distribution of all user choices within an arbitrarily small constant error.Based on the upper bound, we obtain new algorithms for approximate RUM learning and variations thereof. Furthermore, we employ our lower bound for approximate RUM learning to derive lower bounds to fractional extensions of the well-studied $k$-deck and trace reconstruction problems.

Time-Constrained Robust MDPs
Robust reinforcement learning is essential for deploying reinforcement learning algorithms in real-world scenarios where environmental uncertainty predominates.Traditional robust reinforcement learning often depends on rectangularity assumptions, where adverse probability measures of outcome states are assumed to be independent across different states and actions. This assumption, rarely fulfilled in practice, leads to overly conservative policies. To address this problem, we introduce a new time-constrained robust MDP (TC-RMDP) formulation that considers multifactorial, correlated, and time-dependent disturbances, thus more accurately reflecting real-world dynamics. This formulation goes beyond the conventional rectangularity paradigm, offering new perspectives and expanding the analytical framework for robust RL.We propose three distinct algorithms, each using varying levels of environmental information, and evaluate them extensively on continuous control benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that these algorithms yield an efficient tradeoff between performance and robustness, outperforming traditional deep robust RL methods in time-constrained environments while preserving robustness in classical benchmarks.This study revisits the prevailing assumptions in robust RL and opens new avenues for developing more practical and realistic RL applications.

Time Makes Space: Emergence of Place Fields in Networks Encoding Temporally Continuous Sensory Experiences
The vertebrate hippocampus is thought to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated arenas. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as continuously varying, high-dimensional, sensory experience maps (spatially smoothed Gaussian random fields). Training our autoencoder to accurately pattern-complete and reconstruct sensory experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network’s hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and (d) slow representational drift of place fields.  We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.

Time-Varying LoRA: Towards Effective Cross-Domain Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models
Large-scale diffusion models are adept at generating high-fidelity images and facilitating image editing and interpolation. However, they have limitations when generating images in evolving domains. This paper introduces Terra, a novel **T**im**e**-va**r**ying low-**r**ank **a**dapter that offers a fine-tuning framework for domain flow generation. The key design in Terra involves constructing a continuous parameter manifold via a time variable with its expressive power theoretically analyzed. Furthermore, this framework offers a generation-based approach to address the domain shift problems in unsupervised domain adaptation and domain generalization. Specifically, Terra transforms images from the source domain to the target domain and generates interpolated domains with various styles to bridge the gap between domains and enhance the model generalization, respectively. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Terra.

TinyTTA: Efficient Test-time Adaptation via Early-exit Ensembles on Edge Devices
The increased adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to the generation of large data streams with applications in healthcare, sustainability and robotics. In some cases, deep neural networks have been deployed directly on these resource-constrained units to limit communication overhead, increase efficiency and privacy, and enable real-time applications. However, a common challenge in this setting is the continuous adaptation of models necessary to accommodate changing environments, i.e., data distributional shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as one potential solution, but its validity has yet to be explored in resource-constrained hardware settings, such as those involving microcontrollers (MCUs). TTA on constrained devices generally suffers from (i) memory overhead due to the full backpropagation of a large pre-trained network, (ii) lack of support for normalization layers on MCUs, and (iii) either memory exhaustion with large batch sizes required for updating or poor performance with small batch sizes. In this paper, we propose TinyTTA, to enable, for the first time, efficient TTA on constrained devices with limited memory. To address the limited memory constraints, we introduce a novel self-ensemble and batch-agnostic early-exit strategy for TTA, which enables continuous adaptation with small batch sizes for reduced memory usage, handles distributional shifts, and improves latency efficiency. Moreover, we develop the TinyTTA Engine, a first-of-its-kind MCU library that enables on-device TTA. We validate TinyTTA on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and an STM32H747 MCU. Experimental results demonstrate that TinyTTA improves TTA accuracy by up to 57.6%, reduces memory usage by up to six times, and achieves faster and more energy-efficient TTA. Notably, TinyTTA is the only framework able to run TTA on MCU STM32H747 with a 512 KB memory constraint while maintaining high performance.

To Err like Human: Affective Bias-Inspired Measures for Visual Emotion Recognition Evaluation
Accuracy is a commonly adopted performance metric in various classification tasks, which measures the proportion of correctly classified samples among all samples. It assumes equal importance for all classes, hence equal severity for misclassifications. However, in the task of emotional classification, due to the psychological similarities between emotions, misclassifying a certain emotion into one class may be more severe than another, e.g. misclassifying 'excitement' as 'anger' apparently is more severe than as 'awe'. Albeit high meaningful for many applications, metrics capable of measuring these cases of misclassifications in visual emotion recognition tasks have yet to be explored. In this paper, based on Mikel's emotion wheel from psychology, we propose a novel approach for evaluating the performance in emotion classification task, which takes into account the distance on the emotion wheel between different emotions to mimic the psychological nuances of emotions. Experimental results in semi-supervised learning on emotion recognition and user study have shown that our proposed metrics is more effective than the accuracy to assess the performance and conforms to the cognitive laws of human emotions. The code is available in the supplementary materials and will be publicly available.

To Learn or Not to Learn, That is the Question
Perceptual learning refers to the practices through which participants learn to improve their performance in perceiving sensory stimuli. Two seemingly conflicting phenomena of specificity and transfer have been widely observed in perceptual learning. Here, we propose a dual-learning model to reconcile these two phenomena. The model consists of two learning processes. One is task-based learning, which is fast and enables the brain to adapt to a task rapidly by using existing feature representations. The other is feature-based learning, which is slow and enables the brain to improve feature representations to match the statistical change of the environment. Associated with different training paradigms, the interactions between these two learning processes induce the rich phenomena of perceptual learning. Specifically, in the training paradigm where the same stimulus condition is presented excessively, feature-based learning is triggered, which incurs specificity, while in the paradigm where the stimulus condition varies during the training, task-based learning dominates to induce the transfer effect. As the number of training sessions under the same stimulus condition increases, a transition from transfer to specificity occurs. We demonstrate that the dual-learning model can account for both the specificity and transfer phenomena observed in classical psychophysical experiments. We hope that this study gives us insight into understanding how the brain balances the accomplishment of a new task and the consumption of learning effort.

Tolerant Algorithms for Learning with Arbitrary Covariate Shift
We study the problem of learning under arbitrary distribution shift, where the learner is trained on a labeled set from one distribution but evaluated on a different, potentially adversarially generated test distribution. We focus on two frameworks: *PQ learning* [GKKM'20], allowing abstention on adversarially generated parts of the test distribution, and *TDS learning* [KSV'23], permitting abstention on the entire test distribution if distribution shift is detected. All prior known algorithms either rely on learning primitives that are computationally hard even for simple function classes, or end up abstaining entirely even in the presence of a tiny amount of distribution shift.      We address both these challenges for natural function classes, including intersections of halfspaces and decision trees, and standard training distributions, including Gaussians. For PQ learning, we give efficient learning algorithms, while for TDS learning, our algorithms can tolerate moderate amounts of distribution shift. At the core of our approach is an improved analysis of spectral outlier-removal techniques from learning with nasty noise.    Our analysis can (1) handle arbitrarily large fraction of outliers, which is crucial for handling arbitrary distribution shifts, and (2) obtain stronger bounds on polynomial moments of the distribution after outlier removal, yielding new insights into polynomial regression under distribution shifts. Lastly, our techniques lead to novel results for tolerant *testable learning* [RV'23], and learning with nasty noise.

Topic-Conversation Relevance (TCR) Dataset and Benchmarks
Workplace meetings are vital to organizational collaboration, yet a large percentage of meetings are rated as ineffective. To help improve meeting effectiveness by understanding if the conversation is on topic, we create a comprehensive Topic-Conversation Relevance (TCR) Dataset that covers a variety of domains and meeting styles. The TCR dataset includes 1,500 unique meetings, 22,000 words in transcripts, and over 15,000 meeting topics, sourced from both newly collected Speech Interruption Meeting (SIM) data and existing public datasets. Along with the text data, we also open-source scripts to generate synthetic meetings or create augmented meetings from the TCR dataset to enhance the data diversity. For each data source, benchmarks are created using GPT-4 to evaluate the model accuracy in understanding transcription-topic relevance.

TopoFR: A Closer Look at Topology Alignment on Face Recognition
The field of face recognition (FR) has undergone significant advancements with the rise of deep learning. Recently, the success of unsupervised learning and graph neural networks has demonstrated the effectiveness of  data structure information. Considering that the FR task can leverage large-scale training data, which intrinsically contains significant structure information, we aim to investigate how to encode such critical structure information into the latent space. As revealed from our observations, directly aligning the structure information between the input and latent spaces inevitably suffers from an overfitting problem, leading to a structure collapse phenomenon in the latent space. To address this problem, we propose TopoFR, a novel FR model that leverages a topological structure alignment strategy called PTSA and a hard sample mining strategy named SDE. Concretely, PTSA uses persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces, effectively preserving the structure information and improving the generalization performance of FR model. To mitigate the impact of hard samples on the latent space structure, SDE accurately identifies hard samples by automatically computing structure damage score (SDS) for each sample, and directs the model to prioritize optimizing these samples. Experimental results on popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TopoFR over the state-of-the-art methods. Code and models are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TopoFR-868E.

Topological Generalization Bounds for Discrete-Time Stochastic Optimization Algorithms
We present a novel set of rigorous and computationally efficient topology-based complexity notions that exhibit a strong correlation with the generalization gap in modern deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs show remarkable generalization properties, yet the source of these capabilities remains elusive, defying the established statistical learning theory. Recent studies have revealed that properties of training trajectories can be indicative of generalization. Building on this insight, state-of-the-art methods have leveraged the topology of these trajectories, particularly their fractal dimension, to quantify generalization. Most existing works compute this quantity by assuming continuous- or infinite-time training dynamics, complicating the development of practical estimators capable of accurately predicting generalization without access to test data. In this paper, we respect the discrete-time nature of training trajectories and investigate the underlying topological quantities that can be amenable to topological data analysis tools. This leads to a new family of reliable topological complexity measures that provably bound the generalization error, eliminating the need for restrictive geometric assumptions. These measures are computationally friendly, enabling us to propose simple yet effective algorithms for computing generalization indices. Moreover, our flexible framework can be extended to different domains, tasks, and architectures. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new complexity measures exhibit a strong correlation with generalization error in industry-standard architectures such as transformers and deep graph networks. Our approach consistently outperforms existing topological bounds across a wide range of datasets, models, and optimizers, highlighting the practical relevance and effectiveness of our complexity measures.

Topological obstruction to the training of shallow ReLU neural networks
Studying the interplay between the geometry of the loss landscape and the optimization trajectories of simple neural networks is a fundamental step for understanding their behavior in more complex settings.This paper reveals the presence of topological obstruction in the loss landscape of shallow ReLU neural networks trained using gradient flow. We discuss how the homogeneous nature of the ReLU activation function constrains the training trajectories to lie on a product of quadric hypersurfaces whose shape depends on the particular initialization of the network's parameters. When the neural network's output is a single scalar, we prove that these quadrics can have multiple connected components, limiting the set of reachable parameters during training. We analytically compute the number of these components and discuss the possibility of mapping one to the other through neuron rescaling and permutation. In this simple setting, we find that the non-connectedness results in a topological obstruction, which, depending on the initialization, can make the global optimum unreachable. We validate this result with numerical experiments.

TopoLogic: An Interpretable Pipeline for Lane Topology Reasoning on Driving Scenes
As an emerging task that integrates perception and reasoning, topology reasoning in autonomous driving scenes has recently garnered widespread attention.  However, existing work often emphasizes "perception over reasoning": they typically boost reasoning performance by enhancing the perception of lanes and directly adopt vanilla MLPs to learn lane topology from lane query. This paradigm overlooks the geometric features intrinsic to the lanes themselves and are prone to being influenced by inherent endpoint shifts in lane detection. To tackle this issue, we propose an interpretable method for lane topology reasoning based on lane geometric distance and lane query similarity, named TopoLogic. This method mitigates the impact of endpoint shifts in geometric space, and introduces explicit similarity calculation in semantic space as a complement. By integrating results from both spaces, our methods provides more comprehensive information for lane topology.  Ultimately, our approach significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on the mainstream benchmark OpenLane-V2 (23.9 v.s. 10.9 in TOP$_{ll}$ and 44.1 v.s. 39.8 in OLS on subsetA). Additionally, our proposed geometric distance topology reasoning method can be incorporated into well-trained models without re-training, significantly enhancing the performance of lane topology reasoning. The codes will be released soon.

Touchstone Benchmark: Are We on the Right Way for Evaluating AI Algorithms for Medical Segmentation?
How can we test AI performance? This question seems trivial, but it isn't. Standard benchmarks often have underlying problems such as in-distribution and small-size test sets, oversimplified metrics, unfair comparisons, and short-term outcome pressure. As a consequence, good performance on standard benchmarks does not guarantee success in real-world scenarios. We address this misalignment issue with Touchstone, a large-scale collaborative benchmark for medical segmentation. This benchmark is based on annotated CT datasets of unprecedented scale: 5,195 training volumes from 76 medical institutions around the world, and 6,933 testing volumes from 8 additional hospitals. This extensive and diverse test set not only makes the benchmark results more statistically meaningful than existing ones, but also systematically tests AI algorithms in varied out-of-distribution scenarios. We invited 14 inventors of various AI algorithms, categorized as CNN, Transformer, and their combinations, to train their algorithms on the publicly available training set. Our team, as a third party, independently evaluated these algorithms on the test set and reported their pros/cons from multiple perspectives. In addition, we also evaluated publicly available AI frameworks---which are more flexible and can support different algorithms---including MONAI and its Auto3DSeg from NVIDIA, nnU-Net from DKFZ, and numerous other open-source repositories such as vision-language framework developed by researchers. We are committed to expanding this benchmark to encourage more innovation of AI algorithms for the medical domain.

Toward Approaches to Scalability in 3D Human Pose Estimation
In the field of 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), scalability and generalization across diverse real-world scenarios remain significant challenges. This paper addresses two key bottlenecks to scalability: limited data diversity caused by 'popularity bias' and increased 'one-to-many' depth ambiguity arising from greater pose diversity. We introduce the Biomechanical Pose Generator (BPG), which leverages biomechanical principles, specifically the normal range of motion, to autonomously generate a wide array of plausible 3D poses without relying on a source dataset, thus overcoming the restrictions of popularity bias. To address depth ambiguity, we propose the Binary Depth Coordinates (BDC), which simplifies depth estimation into a binary classification of joint positions (front or back). This method decomposes a 3D pose into three core elements—2D pose, bone length, and binary depth decision—substantially reducing depth ambiguity and enhancing model robustness and accuracy, particularly in complex poses. Our results demonstrate that these approaches increase the diversity and volume of pose data while consistently achieving performance gains, even amid the complexities introduced by increased pose diversity.

Toward a Well-Calibrated Discrimination via Survival Outcome-Aware Contrastive Learning
Previous deep learning approaches for survival analysis have primarily relied on ranking losses to improve discrimination performance, which often comes at the expense of calibration performance. To address such an issue, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach specifically designed to enhance discrimination without sacrificing calibration. Our method employs weighted sampling within a contrastive learning framework, assigning lower penalties to samples with similar survival outcomes. This aligns well with the assumption that patients with similar event times share similar clinical statuses. Consequently, when augmented with the commonly used negative log-likelihood loss, our approach significantly improves discrimination performance without directly manipulating the model outputs, thereby achieving better calibration.Experiments on multiple real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art deep survival models in both discrimination and calibration. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we further validate the effectiveness of our approach through quantitative and qualitative analyses.

Toward Real Ultra Image Segmentation: Leveraging Surrounding Context to Cultivate General Segmentation Model
Existing ultra image segmentation methods suffer from two major challenges, namely the generalization issue (i.e. they lack the stability and generality of standard segmentation models, as they are tailored to specific datasets), and the architectural issue (i.e. they are incompatible with real-world ultra image scenes, as they compromise between image size and computing resources).To tackle these issues, we revisit the classic sliding inference framework, upon which we propose a Surrounding Guided Segmentation  framework  (SGNet) for ultra image segmentation. The SGNet leverages a larger area around each image patch to refine the general segmentation results of local patches.Specifically, we propose a surrounding context integration module to absorb surrounding context information and extract specific features that are beneficial to local patches. Note that, SGNet can be seamlessly integrated to any general segmentation model.Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that SGNet achieves competitive performance and consistent improvements across a variety of general segmentation models, surpassing the traditional ultra image segmentation methods by a large margin.

Toward Robust Incomplete Multimodal Sentiment Analysis via Representation Factorization and Alignment
Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is an important research area that aims to understand and recognize human sentiment through multiple modalities. The complementary information provided by multimodal fusion promotes better sentiment analysis compared to utilizing only unimodal modalities. Nevertheless, in real-world applications, many unavoidable factors may lead to situations of uncertain modality missing, thus hindering the effectiveness of multimodal modeling and degrading the model's performance. To this end, we propose a Representation Factorization and Alignment (ReFA) framework for the MSA task under uncertain missing modalities. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained representation factorization module that sufficiently extracts valuable sentiment information by factorizing modality into sentiment-relevant and modality-specific representations through crossmodal translation and sentiment semantic reconstruction. Moreover, a hierarchical mutual information maximization mechanism is introduced to incrementally maximize the mutual information between multi-scale representations to align and reconstruct the high-level semantics in the representations. Eventually, we propose a hierarchical adversarial learning mechanism that progressively aligns and adapts the latent distributions of the representations to produce robust joint multimodal representations. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves MSA performance under both uncertain missing-modality and complete-modality testing conditions.

Towards Accurate and Fair Cognitive Diagnosis via Monotonic Data Augmentation
Intelligent education stands as a prominent application of machine learning. Within this domain, cognitive diagnosis (CD) is a key research focus that aims to diagnose students' proficiency levels in specific knowledge concepts. As a crucial task within the field of education, cognitive diagnosis encompasses two fundamental requirements: accuracy and fairness. Existing studies have achieved significant success by primarily utilizing observed historical logs of student-exercise interactions. However, real-world scenarios often present a challenge, where a substantial number of students engage with a limited number of exercises. This data sparsity issue can lead to both inaccurate and unfair diagnoses. To this end, we introduce a monotonic data augmentation framework, CMCD, to tackle the data sparsity issue and thereby achieve accurate and fair CD results. Specifically, CMCD integrates the monotonicity assumption, a fundamental educational principle in CD, to establish two constraints for data augmentation. These constraints are general and can be applied to the majority of CD backbones. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to guarantee the accuracy and convergence speed of CMCD. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world datasets showcase the efficacy of our framework in addressing the data sparsity issue with accurate and fair CD results.

Towards a "Universal Translator" for Neural Dynamics at Single-Cell, Single-Spike Resolution
Neuroscience research has made immense progress over the last decade, but our understanding of the brain remains fragmented and piecemeal: the dream of probing an arbitrary brain region and automatically reading out the information encoded in its neural activity remains out of reach. In this work, we build towards a first foundation model for neural spiking data that can solve a diverse set of tasks across multiple brain areas. We introduce a novel self-supervised modeling approach for population activity in which the model alternates between masking out and reconstructing neural activity across different time steps, neurons, and brain regions. To evaluate our approach, we design unsupervised and supervised prediction tasks using the International Brain Laboratory repeated site dataset, which is comprised of Neuropixels recordings targeting the same brain locations across 48 animals and experimental sessions. The prediction tasks include single-neuron and region-level activity prediction, forward prediction, and behavior decoding. We demonstrate that our multi-task-masking (MtM) approach significantly improves the performance of current state-of-the-art population models and enables multi-task learning. We also show that by training on multiple animals, we can improve the generalization ability of the model to unseen animals, paving the way for a foundation model of the brain at single-cell, single-spike resolution.

Towards Calibrated Robust Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models
Improving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization through in-distribution (ID) adaptation is a primary goal of robust fine-tuning methods beyond the naive fine-tuning approach. However, despite decent OOD generalization performance from recent robust fine-tuning methods, OOD confidence calibration for reliable machine learning has not been fully addressed. This work proposes a robust fine-tuning method that improves both OOD accuracy and calibration error in Vision Language Models (VLMs). Firstly, we show that both types of errors have a shared upper bound consisting of two terms of ID data: 1) calibration error and 2) the smallest singular value of the input covariance matrix. Based on this insight, we design a novel framework that conducts fine-tuning with a constrained multimodal contrastive loss enforcing a larger smallest singular value, which is further aided by the self-distillation of a moving averaged model to achieve well-calibrated prediction. Starting from an empirical validation of our theoretical statements, we provide extensive experimental results on ImageNet distribution shift benchmarks that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Towards Combating Frequency Simplicity-biased Learning for Domain Generalization
Domain generalization methods aim to learn transferable knowledge from source domains that can generalize well to unseen target domains. Recent studies show that neural networks frequently suffer from a simplicity-biased learning behavior which leads to over-reliance on specific frequency sets, namely as frequency shortcuts, instead of semantic information, resulting in poor generalization performance. Despite previous data augmentation techniques successfully enhancing generalization performances, they intend to apply more frequency shortcuts, thereby causing hallucinations of generalization improvement.In this paper, we aim to prevent such learning behavior of applying frequency shortcuts from a data-driven perspective. Given the theoretical justification of models' biased learning behavior on different spatial frequency components, which is based on the dataset frequency properties, we argue that the learning behavior on various frequency components could be manipulated by changing the dataset statistical structure in the Fourier domain. Intuitively, as frequency shortcuts are hidden in the dominant and highly dependent frequencies of dataset structure, dynamically perturbating the over-reliance frequency components could prevent the application of frequency shortcuts.To this end, we propose two effective data augmentation modules designed to collaboratively and adaptively adjust the frequency characteristic of the dataset, aiming to dynamically influence the learning behavior of the model and ultimately serving as a strategy to mitigate shortcut learning. Our code will be made publicly available.

Towards Dynamic Message Passing on Graphs
Message passing plays a vital role in graph neural networks (GNNs) for effective feature learning. However, the over-reliance on input topology diminishes the efficacy of message passing and restricts the ability of GNNs. Despite efforts made to mitigate the reliance, existing study encounters message-passing bottlenecks or high computational expense problems, which invokes the demands for flexible message passing with low complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic message-passing mechanism for GNNs. It projects graph nodes and learnable pseudo nodes into a common space with measurable spatial relations between them. With nodes moving in the space, their evolving relations facilitate flexible pathway construction for a dynamic message-passing process. Associating pseudo nodes to input graphs with their measured relations, graph nodes can communicate with each other intermediately through pseudo nodes under linear complexity.We further develop a GNN model named $\mathtt{N^2}$ based on our dynamic message-passing mechanism. $\mathtt{N^2}$ employs a single recurrent layer to recursively generate the displacements of nodes and construct optimal dynamic pathways. Evaluation on eighteen benchmarks demonstrates the superior performance of $\mathtt{N^2}$ over popular GNNs. $\mathtt{N^2}$ successfully scales to large-scale benchmarks and requires significantly fewer parameters for graph classification with the shared recurrent layer.

Towards Estimating Bounds on the Effect of Policies under Unobserved Confounding
As many practical fields transition to provide personalized decisions, data is increasingly relevant to support the evaluation of candidate plans and policies (e.g., guidelines for the treatment of disease, government directives, etc.). In the machine learning literature, significant efforts have been put into developing machinery to predict the effectiveness of policies efficiently. The challenge is that, in practice, the effectiveness of a candidate policy is not always identifiable, i.e., not uniquely estimable from the combination of the available data and assumptions about the domain at hand (e.g., encoded in a causal graph). In this paper, we develop graphical characterizations and estimation tools to bound the effect of policies given a causal graph and observational data collected in non-identifiable settings. Specifically, our contributions are two-fold: (1) we derive analytical bounds for general probabilistic and conditional policies that are tighter than existing results, (2) we develop an estimation framework to estimate bounds from finite samples, applicable in higher-dimensional spaces and continuously-valued data. We further show that the resulting estimators have favourable statistical properties such as fast convergence and robustness to model misspecification.

Towards Evaluation of Adversarial Robustness and Privacy on Label Mapping Visual Prompting Models
Adversarial robustness and privacy of deep learning (DL) models have always been widely studied in AI security. Adversarial training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to improve the robustness of DL models against adversarial attacks. However, while models with AT demonstrate enhanced robustness, they become more susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIAs), thus increasing the risk of privacy leakage. This indicates a negative trade-off between adversarial robustness and privacy in general deep learning models. Visual prompting is a novel model reprogramming (MR) technique used for fine-tuning pre-trained models, achieving good performance in vision tasks, especially when combined with the label mapping technique. However, the performance of label-mapping-based visual prompting (LM-VP) under adversarial attacks and MIAs still lacks evaluation. In this work, we regard the MR of LM-VP as a unified entity, referred to as the LM-VP model,and take a step toward jointly evaluating the adversarial robustness and privacy of LM-VP models and their combination with transferred AT. Experimental results show that the transferred AT-trained LM-VP models can achieve a good trade-off between adversarial robustness and privacy.

Towards Fast Exact Conformalization of Generalized Parametric Estimation
Conformal prediction converts nearly any point estimator into a prediction interval under standard assumptions while ensuring valid coverage. However, the extensive computational demands of full conformal prediction are daunting in practice, as it necessitates a comprehensive number of trainings across the entire latent label space. Unfortunately, existing efforts to expedite conformalization often carry strong assumptions and are developed specifically for certain models, or they only offer approximate solution sets. To address this gap, we develop a method for fast exact conformalization of generalized statistical estimation. Our analysis reveals that the structure of the solution path is inherently piecewise smooth, and indicates that utilizing second-order information of difference equations suffices to approximate the entire solution spectrum arbitrarily. We provide a unified view that not only encompasses existing work but also attempts to offer geometric insights. Practically, our framework integrates seamlessly with well-studied numerical solvers. As a by-product, we provide a better justified online label-varying algorithm with statistical guarantee, which may be of independent interest. The significant speedups of our algorithm as compared to the existing standard methods are demonstrated across numerous benchmarks.

Towards Global Optimal Visual In-Context Learning Prompt Selection
Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) is a prevailing way to transfer visual foundation models to new tasks by leveraging contextual information contained in in-context examples to enhance learning and prediction of query sample. The fundamental problem in VICL is how to select the best prompt to activate its power as much as possible, which is equivalent to the ranking problem to test the in-context behavior of each candidate in the alternative set and select the best one. To utilize more appropriate ranking metric and leverage more comprehensive information among the alternative set, we propose a novel in-context example selection framework to approximately identify the global optimal prompt, i.e. choosing the best performing in-context examples from all alternatives for each query sample. Our method, dubbed Partial2Global, adopts a transformer-based list-wise ranker to provide a more comprehensive comparison within several alternatives, and a consistency-aware ranking aggregator to generate globally consistent ranking. The effectiveness of Partial2Global is validated through experiments on foreground segmentation, single object detection and image colorization, demonstrating that Partial2Global selects consistently better in-context examples compared with other methods, and thus establish the new state-of-the-arts.

Towards Harmless Rawlsian Fairness Regardless of Demographic Prior
Due to privacy and security concerns, recent advancements in group fairness advocate for model training regardless of demographic information. However, most methods still require prior knowledge of demographics. In this study, we explore the potential for achieving fairness without compromising its utility when no prior demographics are provided to the training set, namely $\textbf{harmless Rawlsian fairness}$. We ascertain that such a fairness requirement with no prior demographic information essential promotes training losses to exhibit a Dirac delta distribution. To this end, we propose a simple but effective method named VFair to minimize the variance of training losses inside the optimal set of empirical losses. This problem is then optimized by a tailored dynamic update approach that operates in both loss and gradient dimensions, directing the model towards relatively fairer solutions while preserving its intact utility. Our experimental findings indicate that regression tasks, which are relatively unexplored from literature, can achieve significant fairness improvement through VFair regardless of any prior, whereas classification tasks usually do not because of their quantized utility measurements.

Towards Heterogeneous Long-tailed Learning: Benchmarking, Metrics, and Toolbox
Long-tailed data distributions pose challenges for a variety of domains like e-commerce, finance, biomedical science, and cyber security, where the performance of machine learning models is often dominated by head categories while tail categories are inadequately learned. This work aims to provide a systematic view of long-tailed learning with regard to three pivotal angles: (A1) the characterization of data long-tailedness, (A2) the data complexity of various domains, and (A3) the heterogeneity of emerging tasks. We develop HeroLT, a comprehensive long-tailed learning benchmark integrating 16 state-of-the-art algorithms, 6 evaluation metrics, and 16 real-world datasets across 5 tasks from 3 domains. HeroLT with novel angles and extensive experiments (313 in total) enables effective and fair evaluation of newly proposed methods compared with existing baselines on varying dataset types. Finally, we conclude by highlighting the significant applications of long-tailed learning and identifying several promising future directions. For accessibility and reproducibility, we open-source our benchmark HeroLT and corresponding results at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HeroLT-9746/.

Towards More Efficient Property Inference Attacks on Graph Neural Networks
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable attention due to their diverse applications. However, the scarcity and quality limitations of graph data present challenges to their training process in practical settings. To facilitate the development of effective GNNs, companies and researchers often seek external collaboration. Yet, directly sharing data raises privacy concerns, motivating data owners to train GNNs on their private graphs and share the trained models instead. Unfortunately, these released models may still inadvertently disclose sensitive properties of their training graphs (e.g., average default rate in a transaction network), leading to severe consequences for data owners. Hence, it is vital for them to evaluate the risk of sensitive information leakage from shared models by devising graph property inference attacks. Existing approaches typically train numerous shadow models for developing such attack, which is computationally intensive and impractical. To address this issue, we propose an efficient graph property inference attack by leveraging model approximation techniques. Our method requires training only a minimal set of models on graphs, by introducing model approximation to generate a sufficient number of approximated models for attacks.  Furthermore, to select approximated models with minimal approximation errors, we theoretically analyze the error bounds for each approximation. Meanwhile, we propose a diversity-enhancing mechanism based on edit distance to ensure diversity among approximated models. Extensive experiments across six real-world scenarios demonstrate our method's substantial improvement over baselines, with average increases of 2.7\% in attack accuracy and 5.6\% in ROC-AUC, while being 6.5× faster compared to the best baseline. Our code is available at: \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/efficient_gpia-8F47}.

Towards Multi-dimensional Explanation Alignment for Medical Classification
The lack of interpretability in the field of medical image analysis has significant ethical and legal implications. Existing interpretable methods in this domain encounter several challenges, including dependency on specific models, difficulties in understanding and visualization, and issues related to efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Med-MICN (Medical Multi-dimensional Interpretable Concept Network). Med-MICN provides interpretability alignment for various angles, including neural symbolic reasoning, concept semantics, and saliency maps, which are superior to current interpretable methods. Its advantages include high prediction accuracy, interpretability across multiple dimensions, and automation through an end-to-end concept labeling process that reduces the need for extensive human training effort when working with new datasets. To demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of Med-MICN, we apply it to four benchmark datasets and compare it with baselines. The results clearly demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our Med-MICN.

Towards Principled Graph Transformers
The expressive power of graph learning architectures based on the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman ($k$-WL) hierarchy is well understood. However, such architectures often fail to deliver solid predictive performance on real-world tasks, limiting their practical impact. In contrast, global attention-based models such as graph transformers demonstrate strong performance in practice, but comparing their expressive power with the $k$-WL hierarchy remains challenging, particularly since these architectures rely on positional or structural encodings for their expressivity and predictive performance. To address this, we show that the recently proposed Edge Transformer, a global attention model operating on node pairs instead of nodes, has 3-WL expressive power when provided with the right tokenization. Empirically, we demonstrate that the Edge Transformer surpasses other theoretically aligned architectures regarding predictive performance while not relying on positional or structural encodings.

Towards Reliable Model Selection for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation: An Empirical Study and A Certified Baseline
Selecting appropriate hyperparameters is crucial for unlocking the full potential of advanced unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods in unlabeled target domains. Although this challenge remains under-explored, it has recently garnered increasing attention with the proposals of various model selection methods. Reliable model selection should maintain performance across diverse UDA methods and scenarios, especially avoiding highly risky worst-case selections—selecting the model or hyperparameter with the worst performance in the pool.Are existing model selection methods reliable and versatile enough for different UDA tasks? In this paper, we provide a comprehensive empirical study involving 8 existing model selection approaches to answer this question. Our evaluation spans 12 UDA methods across 5 diverse UDA benchmarks and 5 popular UDA scenarios.Surprisingly, we find that none of these approaches can effectively avoid the worst-case selection. In contrast, a simple but overlooked ensemble-based selection approach, which we call EnsV, is both theoretically and empirically certified to avoid the worst-case selection, ensuring high reliability. Additionally, EnsV is versatile for various practical but challenging UDA scenarios, including validation of open-partial-set UDA and source-free UDA.Finally, we call for more attention to the reliability of model selection in UDA: avoiding the worst-case is as significant as achieving peak selection performance and should not be overlooked when developing new model selection methods. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Towards Robust \emph{De Novo} Peptide Sequencing in Proteomics against Data Biases
Tandem mass spectrometry has played a pivotal role in advancing proteomics, enabling the high-throughput analysis of protein composition in biological tissues. Despite the development of several deep learning methods for predicting amino acid sequences (peptides) responsible for generating the observed mass spectra, training data biases hinder further advancements of \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing. Firstly, prior methods struggle to identify amino acids with Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) due to their lower frequency in training data compared to canonical amino acids, further resulting in unsatisfactory peptide sequencing performance. Secondly, various noise and missing peaks in mass spectra reduce the reliability of training data (Peptide-Spectrum Matches, PSMs). To address these challenges, we propose AdaNovo, a novel and domain knowledge-inspired framework that calculates Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) between the mass spectra and amino acids or peptides, using CMI for robust training against above biases. Extensive experiments indicate that AdaNovo outperforms previous competitors on the widely-used 9-species benchmark, meanwhile yielding 3.6\% - 9.4\% improvements in PTMs identification. The supplements contain the code.

Towards Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Incomplete Data
The field of Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has recently witnessed an emerging direction seeking to tackle the issue of data incompleteness. Recognizing that the language modality typically contains dense sentiment information, we consider it as the dominant modality and present an innovative Language-dominated Noise-resistant Learning Network (LNLN) to achieve robust MSA. The proposed LNLN features a dominant modality correction (DMC) module and dominant modality based multimodal learning (DMML) module, which enhances the model's robustness across various noise scenarios by ensuring the quality of dominant modality representations. Aside from the methodical design, we perform comprehensive experiments under random data missing scenarios, utilizing diverse and meaningful settings on several popular datasets (e.g., MOSI, MOSEI, and SIMS), providing additional uniformity, transparency, and fairness compared to existing evaluations in the literature. Empirically, LNLN consistently outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating superior performance across these challenging and extensive evaluation metrics.

Towards Stable Representations for Protein Interface Prediction
The knowledge of protein interactions is crucial but challenging for drug discovery applications. This work focuses on protein interface prediction, which aims to determine whether a pair of residues from different proteins interact. Existing data-driven methods have made significant progress in effectively learning protein structures. Nevertheless, they overlook the conformational changes (i.e., flexibility) within proteins upon binding, leading to poor generalization ability. In this paper, we regard the protein flexibility as an attack on the trained model and aim to defend against it for improved generalization. To fulfill this purpose, we propose ATProt, an adversarial training framework for protein representations to robustly defend against the attack of protein flexibility. ATProt can theoretically guarantee protein representation stability under complicated protein flexibility. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that ATProt consistently improves the performance for protein interface prediction. Moreover, our method demonstrates broad applicability, performing the best even when provided with testing structures from structure prediction models like ESMFold and AlphaFold2.

Towards the Dynamics of a DNN Learning Symbolic Interactions
This study proves the two-phase dynamics of a deep neural network (DNN) learning interactions. Despite the long disappointing view of the faithfulness of post-hoc explanation of a DNN, in recent years, a series of theorems have been proven [27] to show that given an input sample, a small number of interactions between input variables can be considered as primitive inference patterns, which can faithfully represent every detailed inference logic of the DNN on this sample. Particularly, it has been observed [42] that various DNNs all learn interactions of different complexities with two-phase dynamics, and this well explains how a DNN's generalization power changes from under-fitting to over-fitting. Therefore, in this study, we prove the dynamics of a DNN gradually encoding interactions of different complexities, which provides a theoretically grounded mechanism for the over-fitting of a DNN. Experiments show that our theory well predicts the real learning dynamics of various DNNs on different tasks.

Towards training digitally-tied analog blocks via hybrid gradient computation
Power efficiency is plateauing in the standard digital electronics realm such that novel hardware, models, and algorithms are needed to reduce the costs of AI training. The combination of energy-based analog circuits and the Equilibrium Propagation (EP) algorithm constitutes one compelling alternative compute paradigm for gradient-based optimization of neural nets. Existing analog hardware accelerators, however, typically incorporate digital circuitry to sustain auxiliary non-weight-stationary operations, mitigate analog device imperfections, and leverage existing digital accelerators.This heterogeneous hardware approach calls for a new theoretical model building block. In this work, we introduce \emph{Feedforward-tied Energy-based Models} (ff-EBMs), a hybrid model comprising feedforward and energy-based blocks accounting for digital and analog circuits. We derive a novel algorithm to compute gradients end-to-end in ff-EBMs by backpropagating and “eq-propagating'' through feedforward and energy-based parts respectively, enabling EP to be applied to much more flexible and realistic architectures. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on ff-EBMs where Deep Hopfield Networks (DHNs) are used as energy-based blocks. We first show that a standard DHN can be arbitrarily split into any uniform size while maintaining performance. We then train ff-EBMs on ImageNet32 where we establish new SOTA performance in the EP literature (46 top-1 \%). Our approach offers a principled, scalable, and incremental roadmap to gradually integrate self-trainable analog computational primitives into existing digital accelerators.

Towards Understanding How Transformers Learn In-context Through a Representation Learning Lens
Pre-trained large language models based on Transformers have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) abilities. With just a few demonstration examples, the models can implement new tasks without any parameter updates. However, it is still an open question to understand the mechanism of ICL. In this paper, we attempt to explore the ICL process in Transformers through a lens of representation learning. Initially, leveraging kernel methods, we figure out a dual model for one softmax attention layer. The ICL inference process of the attention layer aligns with the training procedure of its  dual model, generating token representation predictions that are equivalent to the dual model's test outputs. We delve into the training process of this  dual model from a representation learning standpoint and further derive a generalization error bound related to the quantity of demonstration tokens. Subsequently, we extend our theoretical conclusions to more complicated scenarios, including one Transformer layer and multiple attention layers. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from existing representation learning methods especially contrastive learning, we propose potential modifications for the attention layer. Finally, experiments are designed to support our findings.

Towards Understanding the Working Mechanism of Text-to-Image Diffusion Model
Recently, the strong latent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has been applied to high-quality Text-to-Image (T2I) generation (e.g., Stable Diffusion), by injecting the encoded target text prompt into the gradually denoised diffusion image generator. Despite the success of DPM in practice, the mechanism behind it remains to be explored. To fill this blank, we begin by examining the intermediate statuses during the gradual denoising generation process in DPM. The empirical observations indicate, the shape of image is reconstructed after the first few denoising steps, and then the image is filled with details (e.g., texture). The phenomenon is because the low-frequency signal (shape relevant) of the noisy image is not corrupted until the final stage in the forward process (initial stage of generation) of adding noise in DPM. Inspired by the observations, we proceed to explore the influence of each token in the text prompt during the two stages. After a series of experiments of T2I generations conditioned on a set of text prompts. We conclude that in the earlier generation stage, the image is mostly decided by the special token [\texttt{EOS}] in the text prompt, and the information in the text prompt is already conveyed in this stage. After that, the diffusion model completes the details of generated images by information from themselves. Finally, we propose to apply this observation to accelerate the process of T2I generation by properly removing text guidance, which finally accelerates the sampling up to 25\%+.

Towards Unified One-tower Expression Grounding and Segmentation with Mask Referring Modeling
Constrained by the separate encoding of vision and language, existing grounding and referring segmentation works heavily rely on bulky Transformer-based fusion en-/decoders and a variety of early-stage interaction technologies. Simultaneously, the current masked visual language modeling (MVLM) fails to capture the nuanced referential relationship between image-text in referring tasks. In this paper, we propose **UniRef**, a minimalist referring framework built on the modality-shared transformer that unifies the visual and linguistic feature spaces. To modeling the referential relationship, we introduce a novel MVLM paradigm called masked referring modeling (**MRefM**), which encompasses both referring-aware mask image modeling and referring-aware mask language modeling. Both modules not only reconstruct modality-related content but also cross-modal referring content. Within MRefM, we propose a referring-aware dynamic image masking strategy that is aware of the referred region rather than relying on fixed ratios or generic masking schemes. By leveraging the unified visual language feature space and incorporating MRefM's ability to model the referential relations, our approach enables direct regression of the referring results without resorting to various complex techniques. Our method consistently surpasses existing approaches and achieves SoTA performance on both grounding and segmentation tasks, providing valuable insights for future research. All of the code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Towards Universal Mesh Movement Networks
Solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) accurately and efficiently is an essential and challenging problem in all scientific and engineering disciplines. Mesh movement methods provide the capability to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall mesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods are extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary geometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from scratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their applicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of inverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive, zero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and structures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary geometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting features and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh. We evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well as a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method outperforms existing learning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described above. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Ampère PDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh movement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method fails.

TPC: Test-time Procrustes Calibration for Diffusion-based Human Image Animation
Human image animation aims to generate a human motion video from the inputs of a reference human image and a target motion video. Current diffusion-based image animation systems exhibit high precision in transferring human identity into targeted motion, yet they still exhibit irregular quality in their outputs. Their optimal precision is achieved only when the physical compositions (i.e., scale and rotation) of the human shapes in the reference image and target pose frame are aligned. In the absence of such alignment, there is a noticeable decline in fidelity and consistency. Especially, in real-world environments, this compositional misalignment commonly occurs, posing significant challenges to the practical usage of current systems. To this end, we propose Test-time Procrustes Calibration (TPC), which enhances the robustness of diffusion-based image animation systems by maintaining optimal performance even when faced with compositional misalignment, effectively addressing real-world scenarios. The TPC provides a calibrated reference image for the diffusion model, enhancing its capability to understand the correspondence between human shapes in the reference and target images. Our method is simple and can be applied to any diffusion-based image animation system in a model-agnostic manner, improving the effectiveness at test time without additional training. The code will be made publicly available.

Trace is the New AutoDiff: Unlocking Efficient Optimization of Computational Workflows
We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. We propose an end-to-end optimization framework, Trace, which treats the computational workflow of an AI system as a graph akin to neural networks, based on a generalization of back-propagation. Optimization of computational workflows often involves rich feedback (e.g. console output or user’s responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, hyper-parameters, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). Moreover, its computation graph can change dynamically with the inputs and parameters. We frame a new mathematical setup of iterative optimization, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO), to capture and abstract these properties so as to design optimizers that work across many domains. In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output. Trace is the tool to implement OPTO in practice: Trace has a Python interface that efficiently converts a computational workflow into an OPTO instance using a PyTorch-like interface. Using Trace, we develop a general-purpose optimizer called OptoPrime that can effectively solve OPTO problems. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We believe that Trace, OptoPrime and the OPTO framework will enable the next generation of interactive agents that automatically adapt using various kinds of feedback.

Tracing Hyperparameter Dependencies for Model Parsing via Learnable Graph Pooling Network
\textit{Model Parsing} defines the research task of predicting hyperparameters of the generative model (GM), given a generated image as input. Since a diverse set of hyperparameters is jointly employed by the generative model, and dependencies often exist among them, it is crucial to learn these hyperparameter dependencies for improved model parsing performance. To explore such important dependencies, we propose a novel model parsing method called Learnable Graph Pooling Network (LGPN), in which we formulate model parsing into a graph node classification task, using graph nodes and edges to represent hyperparameters and their dependencies, respectively. Furthermore, LGPN incorporates a learnable pooling-unpooling mechanism tailored to model parsing, which adaptively learns hyperparameter dependencies of GMs used to generate the input image. Also, we introduce a Generation Trace Capturing Network (GTC) that can efficiently identify generation traces of input images, enhancing the understanding of generated images' provenances.Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art results in model parsing and its extended applications, showing the superiority of the proposed LGPN.

TrAct: Making First-layer Pre-Activations Trainable
We consider the training of the first layer of vision models and notice the clear relationship between pixel values and gradient update magnitudes: the gradients arriving at the weights of a first layer are by definition directly proportional to (normalized) input pixel values. Thus, an image with low contrast has a smaller impact on learning than an image with higher contrast, and a very bright or very dark image has a stronger impact on the weights than an image with moderate brightness.In this work, we propose performing gradient descent on the embeddings produced by the first layer of the model.However, switching to discrete inputs with an embedding layer is not a reasonable option for vision models.Thus, we propose the conceptual procedure of (i) a gradient descent step on first layer activations to construct an activation proposal, and (ii) finding the optimal weights of the first layer, i.e., those weights which minimize the squared distance to the activation proposal. We provide a  closed form solution of the procedure and adjust it for robust stochastic training while computing everything efficiently. Empirically, we find that TrAct (Training Activations) speeds up training by factors between 1.25x and 4x while requiring only a small computational overhead. We demonstrate the utility of TrAct with different optimizers for a range of different vision models including convolutional and transformer architectures.

Trading off Consistency and Dimensionality of Convex Surrogates for Multiclass Classification
In multiclass classification over $n$ outcomes, we typically optimize some surrogate loss $L: \mathbb{R}^d \times\mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}$ assigning real-valued error to predictions in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paradigm, outcomes must be embedded into the reals with dimension $d \approx n$ in order to design a consistent surrogate loss. Consistent losses are well-motivated theoretically, yet for large $n$, such as in information retrieval and structured prediction tasks, their optimization may be computationally infeasible. In practice, outcomes are typically embedded into some $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d \ll n$, with little known about their suitability for multiclass classification. We investigate two approaches for trading off consistency and dimensionality in multiclass classification while using a convex surrogate loss. We first formalize partial consistency when the optimized surrogate has dimension $d \ll n$. We then check if partial consistency holds under a given embedding and low-noise assumption, providing insight into when to use a particular embedding into $\mathbb{R}^d$. Finally, we present a new method to construct (fully) consistent losses with $d \ll n$ out of multiple problem instances. Our practical approach leverages parallelism to sidestep lower bounds on $d$.

Trading Place for Space: Increasing Location Resolution Reduces Contextual Capacity in Hippocampal Codes
Researchers have long theorized that animals are capable learning cognitive maps of their environment - a simultaneous representation of context, experience, and position. Since their discovery in the early 1970's, place cells have been assumed to be the neural substrate of these maps. Individual place cells explicitly encode position and appear to encode experience and context through global, population level firing properties. Context, in particular, appears to be encoded through remapping, a process in which subpopulations of place cells change their tuning in response to changes in sensory cues. While many studies have looked at the physiological basis of remapping, the field still lacks explicit calculations of contextual capacity as a function of place field firing properties. Here, we tackle such calculations. First, we construct a geometric approach for understanding population level activity of place cells, assembled from known firing field statistics. We treat different contexts as low dimensional structures embedded in the high dimensional space of firing rates and the distance between these structures as reflective of discriminability between the underlying contexts. Accordingly, we investigate how changes to place cell firing properties effect the distances between representations of different environments within this rate space.Using this approach, we find that the number of contexts storable by the hippocampus grows exponentially with the number of place cells, and calculate this exponent for environments of different sizes. We further identify a fundamental tradeoff between high resolution encoding of position and the number of storable contexts. This tradeoff is tuned by place cell width, which might explain the change in firing field scale along the ventral dorsal axis of the Hippocampus. Finally, we demonstrate that clustering of place cells near likely points of confusion, such as boundaries, increases the contextual capacity of the place system within our framework.

Training Data Attribution via Approximate Unrolling
Many training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to estimate how a model's behavior would change if one or more data points were removed from the training set. Methods based on implicit differentiation, such as influence functions, can be made computationally efficient, but fail to account for underspecification, the implicit bias of the optimization algorithm, or multi-stage training pipelines. By contrast, methods based on unrolling address these issues but face scalability challenges. In this work, we connect the implicit-differentiation-based and unrolling-based approaches and combine their benefits by introducing Source, an approximate unrolling-based TDA method that is computed using an influence-function-like formula. While being computationally efficient compared to unrolling-based approaches, Source is suitable in cases where implicit-differentiation-based approaches struggle, such as in non-converged models and multi-stage training pipelines. Empirically, Source outperforms existing TDA techniques in counterfactual prediction, especially in settings where implicit-differentiation-based approaches fall short.

Training for Stable Explanation for Free
To foster trust in machine learning models, explanations must be faithful and stable for consistent insights. Existing relevant works rely on the $\ell_p$ distance for stability assessment, which diverges from human perception. Besides, existing adversarial training (AT) associated with intensive computations may lead to an arms race. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel metric to assess the stability of top-$k$ salient features. We introduce R2ET which trains for stable explanation by efficient and effective regularizer, and analyze R2ET by multi-objective optimization to prove numerical and statistical stability of explanations. Moreover, theoretical connections between R2ET and certified robustness justify R2ET's stability in all attacks. Extensive experiments across various data modalities and model architectures show that R2ET achieves superior stability against stealthy attacks, and generalizes effectively across different explanation methods.

Training-Free Adaptive Diffusion with Bounded Difference Approximation Strategy
Diffusion models have recently achieved great success in the synthesis of high-quality images and videos. However, the existing denoising techniques in diffusion models are commonly based on step-by-step noise predictions, which suffers from high computation cost, resulting in a prohibitive latency for interactive applications. In this paper, we propose \textit{AdaptiveDiffusion} to relieve this bottleneck by adaptively reducing the noise prediction steps during the denoising process. Our method considers the potential of skipping as many noise prediction steps as possible while keeping the final denoised results identical to the original full-step ones. Specifically, the skipping strategy is guided by the \textit{third}-order latent difference that indicates the stability between timesteps during the denoising process, which benefits the reusing of previous noise prediction results. Extensive experiments on image and video diffusion models demonstrate that our method can significantly speed up the denoising process while generating identical results to the original process, achieving up to an average $2\sim$ $5\times$ speedup without quality degradation.

Training GNNs in Balance by Dynamic Rescaling
Graph neural networks exhibiting a rescale invariance, like GATs, obey a conservation law of its parameters, which has been exploited to derive a balanced state that induces good initial trainability. Yet, finite learning rates as used in practice topple the network out of balance during training. This effect is even more pronounced with larger learning rates that tend to induce improved generalization but make the training dynamics less robust. To support even larger learning rates, we propose to dynamically balance the network according to a different criterion, based on relative gradients, that promotes faster and better. In combination with large learning rates and gradient clipping, dynamic rebalancing significantly improves generalization on real-world data. We observe that rescaling provides us with the flexibility to control the order in which network layers are trained. This leads to novel insights into similar phenomena as grokking, which can further boost generalization performance.

TrajCLIP: Pedestrian trajectory prediction method using contrastive learning and idempotent networks
The distribution of pedestrian trajectories is highly complex and influenced by the scene, nearby pedestrians, and subjective intentions. This complexity presents challenges for modeling and generalizing trajectory prediction. Previous methods modeled the feature space of future trajectories based on the high-dimensional feature space of historical trajectories, but this approach is suboptimal because it overlooks the similarity between historical and future trajectories. Our proposed method, TrajCLIP, utilizes contrastive learning and idempotent generative networks to address this issue. By pairing historical and future trajectories and applying contrastive learning on the encoded feature space, we enforce same-space consistency constraints. To manage complex distributions, we use idempotent loss and tightness loss to control over-expansion in the latent space. Additionally, we have developed a trajectory interpolation algorithm and synthetic trajectory data to enhance model capacity and improve generalization. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that TrajCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance and excels in scene-to-scene transfer, few-shot transfer, and online learning tasks.

TransAgent: Transfer Vision-Language Foundation Models with Heterogeneous Agent Collaboration
Vision-language foundation models (such as CLIP) have recently shown their power in transfer learning, owing to large-scale image-text pre-training. However, target domain data in the downstream tasks can be highly different from the pre-training phase, which makes it hard for such a single model to generalize well. Alternatively, there exists a wide range of expert models that contain diversified vision and/or language knowledge pre-trained on different modalities, tasks, networks, and datasets. Unfortunately, these models are "isolated agents" with heterogeneous structures, and how to integrate their knowledge for generalizing CLIP-like models has not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, we propose a general and concise TransAgent framework, which transports the knowledge of the isolated agents in a unified manner, and effectively guides CLIP to generalize with multi-source knowledge distillation. With such a distinct framework, we flexibly collaborate with 11 heterogeneous agents to empower vision-language foundation models, without further cost in the inference phase. Finally, our TransAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 visual recognition datasets. Under the same low-shot setting, it outperforms the popular CoOp with around 10\% on average, and 20\% on EuroSAT which contains large domain shifts.

Transcendence: Generative Models Can Outperform The Experts That Train Them
Generative models are trained with the simple objective of imitating the conditional probability distribution induced by the data they are trained on. Therefore, when trained on data generated by humans, we may not expect the artificial model to outperform the humans on their original objectives. In this work, we study the phenomenon of *transcendence*: when a generative model achieves capabilities that surpass the abilities of the experts generating its data. We demonstrate transcendence by training an autoregressive transformer to play chess from game transcripts, and show that the trained model can sometimes achieve better performance than all players in the dataset. We theoretically prove that transcendence is enabled by low-temperature sampling, and rigorously assess this experimentally. Finally, we discuss other sources of transcendence, laying the groundwork for future investigation of this phenomenon in a broader setting.

Transcoders find interpretable LLM feature circuits
A key goal in mechanistic interpretability is circuit analysis: finding sparse subgraphs of models corresponding to specific behaviors or capabilities. However, MLP sublayers make fine-grained circuit analysis on transformer-based language models difficult. In particular, interpretable features---such as those found by sparse autoencoders (SAEs)---are typically linear combinations of extremely many neurons, each with its own nonlinearity to account for. Circuit analysis in this setting thus either yields intractably large circuits or fails to disentangle local and global behavior. To address this we explore **transcoders**, which seek to faithfully approximate a densely activating MLP layer with a wider, sparsely-activating MLP layer. We successfully train transcoders on language models with 120M, 410M, and 1.4B parameters, and find them to perform at least on par with SAEs in terms of sparsity, faithfulness, and human-interpretability. We then introduce a novel method for using transcoders to perform weights-based circuit analysis through MLP sublayers. The resulting circuits neatly factorize into input-dependent and input-invariant terms. Finally, we apply transcoders to reverse-engineer unknown circuits in the model, and we obtain novel insights regarding the "greater-than circuit" in GPT2-small. Our results suggest that transcoders can prove effective in decomposing model computations involving MLPs into interpretable circuits.

Transductive Sample Complexities Are Compact
We demonstrate a compactness result holding broadly across supervised learning with a general class of loss functions: Any hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ is learnable with transductive sample complexity $m$ precisely when all of its finite projections are learnable with sample complexity $m$. We prove that this exact form of compactness holds for realizable and agnostic learning with respect to all \emph{proper} metric loss functions (e.g., any norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$) and any continuous loss on a compact space (e.g., cross-entropy, squared loss). For realizable learning with \emph{improper} metric losses, we show that exact compactness of sample complexity can fail, and provide matching upper and lower bounds of a factor of 2 on the extent to which such sample complexities can differ. We conjecture that larger gaps are possible for the agnostic case. Furthermore, invoking the equivalence between sample complexities in the PAC and transductive models (up to lower order factors, in the realizable case) permits us to directly port our results to the PAC model, revealing an almost-exact form of compactness holding broadly in PAC learning.

Transferability Bound Theory: Exploring Relationship between Adversarial Transferability and Flatness
A prevailing belief in attack and defense community is that the higher flatness of adversarial examples enables their better cross-model transferability, leading to a growing interest in employing sharpness-aware minimization and its variants. However, the theoretical relationship between the transferability of adversarial examples and their flatness has not been established, making the belief questionable. To bridge this gap, we embark on a theoretical investigation and, for the first time, derive a theoretical bound for the transferability of adversarial examples with few practical assumptions. Our analysis challenges this belief by demonstrating that the increased flatness of adversarial examples is not a guarantor of improved transferability. Moreover, building upon the theoretical analysis, we propose an attack called Theoretically Provable Adversarial attack (TPA), which optimizes a surrogate of the derived bound to craft adversarial examples. The extensive examinations across standard benchmarks and diverse real-world applications show that the transferability of adversarial examples crafted by TPA can be considerably boosted compared with state-of-the-art baselines. We hope that the theoretical results can recalibrate preconceived impressions within our community and facilitate the development of stronger adversarial attacks and defense mechanisms.

Transferable Adversarial Attacks on SAM and Its Downstream Models via Universal Meta Initialization and Gradient Robust Attacks
The utilization of large foundational models has a dilemma: while fine-tuning downstream tasks from them holds promise for making use of the well-generalized knowledge in practical applications, their open accessibility also poses threats of adverse usage.This paper, for the first time, explores the feasibility of adversarial attacking various downstream models fine-tuned from the segment anything model (SAM), by solely utilizing the information from the open-sourced SAM. In contrast to prevailing transfer-based adversarial attacks, we demonstrate the existence of adversarial dangers even without accessing the downstream task and dataset to train a similar surrogate model.To enhance the effectiveness of the adversarial attack towards models fine-tuned on unknown datasets, we propose a universal meta-initialization (UMI) algorithm to extract the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the foundation model, which is then utilized as the prior knowledge to guide the generation of adversarial perturbations.Moreover, by formulating the gradient difference in the attacking process between the open-sourced SAM and its fine-tuned downstream models, we theoretically demonstrate that a deviation occurs in the adversarial update direction by directly maximizing the distance of encoded feature embeddings in the open-sourced SAM.Consequently, we propose a gradient robust loss that simulates the associated uncertainty with gradient-based noise augmentation to enhance the robustness of generated adversarial examples (AEs) towards this deviation, thus improving the transferability.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed universal meta-initialized and gradient robust adversarial attack (UMI-GRAT) toward SAMs and their downstream models.

Transferable Reinforcement Learning via Generalized Occupancy Models
Intelligent agents must be generalists, capable of quickly adapting to various tasks. In reinforcement learning (RL), model-based RL learns a dynamics model of the world, in principle enabling transfer to arbitrary reward functions through planning. However, autoregressive model rollouts suffer from compounding error, making model-based RL ineffective for long-horizon problems. Successor features offer an alternative by modeling a policy's long-term state occupancy, reducing policy evaluation under new tasks to linear reward regression. Yet, policy improvement with successor features can be challenging. This work proposes a novel class of models, i.e., generalized occupancy models (GOMs), that learn a distribution of successor features from a stationary dataset, along with a policy that acts to realize different successor features. These models can quickly select the optimal action for arbitrary new tasks. By directly modeling long-term outcomes in the dataset, GOMs avoid compounding error while enabling rapid transfer across reward functions. We present a practical instantiation of GOMs using diffusion models and show their efficacy as a new class of transferable models, both theoretically and empirically across various simulated robotics problems.

Transfer Learning for Diffusion Models
Diffusion models, a specific type of generative model, have achieved unprecedented performance in recent years and consistently produce high-quality synthetic samples. A critical prerequisite for their notable success lies in the presence of a substantial number of training samples, which can be impractical in real-world applications due to high collection costs or associated risks. Consequently, various finetuning and regularization approaches have been proposed to transfer knowledge from existing pre-trained models to specific target domains with limited data. This paper introduces the Transfer Guided Diffusion Process (TGDP), a novel approach distinct from conventional finetuning and regularization methods. We prove that the optimal diffusion model for the target domain integrates pre-trained diffusion models on the source domain with additional guidance from a domain classifier. We further extend TGDP to a conditional version for modeling the joint distribution of data and its corresponding labels, together with two additional regularization terms to enhance the model performance. We validate the effectiveness of TGDP on Gaussian mixture simulations and on real electrocardiogram (ECG) datasets.

Transfer Learning for Latent Variable Network Models
We study transfer learning for estimation in latent variable network models. In our setting, the conditional edge probability matrices given the latent variables are represented by $P$ for the source and $Q$ for the target. We wish to estimate $Q$ given two kinds of data: (1) edge data from a subgraph induced by an $o(1)$ fraction of the nodes of $Q$, and (2) edge data from all of $P$. If the source $P$ has no relation to the target $Q$, the estimation error must be $\Omega(1)$. However, we show that if the latent variables are shared, then vanishing error is possible. We give an efficient algorithm that utilizes the ordering of a suitably defined graph distance. Our algorithm achieves $o(1)$ error and does not assume a parametric form on the source or target networks. Next, for the specific case of Stochastic Block Models we prove a minimax lower bound and show that a simple algorithm achieves this rate. Finally, we empirically demonstrate our algorithm's use on real-world and simulated graph transfer problems.

Transferring disentangled representations: bridging the gap between synthetic and real images
Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels. Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is possible and effective.

Transformation-Invariant Learning and Theoretical Guarantees for OOD Generalization
Learning with identical train and test distributions has been extensively investigated both practically and theoretically. Much remains to be understood, however, in statistical learning under distribution shifts. This paper focuses on a distribution shift setting where train and test distributions can be related by classes of (data) transformation maps. We initiate a theoretical study for this framework, investigating learning scenarios where the target class of transformations is either known or unknown. We establish learning rules and algorithmic reductions to Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), accompanied with  learning guarantees. We obtain upper bounds on the sample complexity in terms of the VC dimension of the class composing predictors with transformations, which we show in many cases is not much larger than the VC dimension of the class of predictors. We highlight that the learning rules we derive offer a game-theoretic viewpoint on distribution shift: a learner searching for predictors and an adversary searching for transformation maps to respectively minimize and maximize the worst-case loss.

Transformer Efficiently Learns Low-dimensional Target Functions In-context
Transformers can efficiently learn in-context from example demonstrations. Most existing theoretical analyses studied the in-context learning (ICL) ability of transformers for linear function classes, where it is typically shown that the minimizer of the pretraining loss implements one gradient descent step on the least squares objective. However, this simplified linear setting arguable does not demonstrate the statistical efficiency of ICL, since the trained transformer does not outperform directly doing linear regression on the test prompt. We study ICL of a nonlinear function class via transformer with nonlinear MLP layer: given a class of single-index target functions $f_*(x) = \sigma_*(\langle x,\beta\rangle)$, where the index features $\beta\in\mathbb{R}^d$ are drawn from a rank-$r$ subspace, we show that a nonlinear transformer optimized by gradient descent on the empirical loss learns $f_*$ in-context with a prompt length that only depends on the dimension of function class $r$; in contrast, an algorithm that directly learns $f_*$ on test prompt yields a statistical complexity that scales with the ambient dimension $d$. Our result highlights the adaptivity of ICL to low-dimensional structures of the function class.

Transformers as Game Players: Provable In-context Game-playing Capabilities of Pre-trained Models
The in-context learning (ICL) capability of pre-trained models based on the transformer architecture has received growing interest in recent years. While theoretical understanding has been obtained for ICL in reinforcement learning (RL), the previous results are largely confined to the single-agent setting. This work proposes to further explore the in-context learning capabilities of pre-trained transformer models in competitive multi-agent games, i.e., in-context game-playing (ICGP). Focusing on the classical two-player zero-sum games, theoretical guarantees are provided to demonstrate that pre-trained transformers can provably learn to approximate Nash equilibrium in an in-context manner for both decentralized and centralized learning settings. As a key part of the proof, constructional results are established to demonstrate that the transformer architecture is sufficiently rich to realize celebrated multi-agent game-playing algorithms, in particular, decentralized V-learning and centralized VI-ULCB.

Transformers Can Do Arithmetic with the Right Embeddings
The poor performance of transformers on arithmetic tasks seems to stem in large part from their inability to keep track of the exact position of each digit inside of a large span of digits. We mend this problem by adding an embedding to each digit that encodes its position relative to the start of the number. In addition to the boost these embeddings provide on their own, we show that this fix enables architectural modifications such as input injection and recurrent layers to improve performance even further.With positions resolved, we can study the logical extrapolation ability of transformers. Can they solve arithmetic problems that are larger and more complex than those in their training data? We find that training on only 20 digit numbers with a single GPU for one day, we can reach state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 99% accuracy on 100 digit addition problems. Finally, we show that these gains in numeracy also unlock improvements on other multi-step reasoning tasks including sorting and multiplication.

Transformers Learn Higher-Order Optimization Methods for In-Context Learning: A Study with Linear Models
Transformers excel at *in-context learning* (ICL)---learning from demonstrations without parameter updates---but how they do so remains a mystery. Recent work suggests that Transformers may internally run Gradient Descent (GD), a first-order optimization method, to perform ICL. In this paper, we instead demonstrate that Transformers learn to approximate higher-order optimization methods for ICL. For in-context linear regression, Transformers share a similar convergence rate as *Iterative Newton's Method*, both *exponentially* faster than GD. Empirically, predictions from successive Transformer layers closely match different iterations of Newton’s Method linearly, with each middle layer roughly computing 3 iterations; thus, Transformers and Newton’s method converge at roughly the same rate. In contrast, Gradient Descent converges exponentially more slowly. We also show that Transformers can learn in-context on ill-conditioned data, a setting where Gradient Descent struggles but Iterative Newton succeeds. Finally, to corroborate our empirical findings, we prove that Transformers can implement $k$ iterations of Newton's method with $k + \mathcal O(1)$ layers.

Transformers on Markov data: Constant depth suffices
Attention-based transformers have been remarkably successful at modeling generative processes across various domains and modalities. In this paper, we study the behavior of transformers on data drawn from $k^{\text{th}}$-order Markov processes, where the conditional distribution of the next symbol in a sequence depends on the previous $k$ symbols observed. We observe a surprising phenomenon empirically which contradicts previous findings: when trained for sufficiently long, a transformer with a fixed depth and $1$ head per layer is able to achieve low test loss on sequences drawn from $k^{\text{th}}$-order Markov sources, even as $k$ grows. Furthermore, this low test loss is achieved by the transformer’s ability to represent and learn the in-context conditional empirical distribution. On the theoretical side, we prove that a transformer with $O(\log_2(k))$ layers can represent the in-context conditional empirical distribution by composing induction heads to track the previous $k$ symbols in the sequence. Surprisingly, with the addition of layer normalization, we show that a transformer with a constant number of layers can represent the in-context conditional empirical distribution, concurring with our empirical observations. This result provides more insight into the benefit of soft-attention and non-linearities in the transformer architecture.

Transformers to SSMs: Distilling Quadratic Knowledge to Subquadratic Models
Transformer architectures have become a dominant paradigm for domains like language modeling, but suffer in many inference settings due to their quadratic-time self-attention. Recently proposed sub-quadratic architectures such as Mamba have shown promise, but have been pretrained with substantially less computational resources than the strongest Transformer models. In this work, we present a method that is able to distill a pre-trained Transformer architecture into alternative architectures such as state space models (SSMs).  The key idea to our approach is that we can view both Transformers and SSMs as applying different forms of mixing matrices over the token sequences. We can thus progressively distill the Transformer architecture by matching different degrees of granularity in the SSM: first matching the mixing matrices themselves, then the hidden units at each block, then the end-to-end predictions.  Our method, termed MOHAWK, is able to distill a Mamba-2 variant based upon the Phi-1.5 architecture (Phi-Mamba), using less than 3B tokens.  Despite using less than 1\% of the training data typically used to train models from scratch, we demonstrate substantially stronger performance than all past open source non-Transformer models.  This demonstrates that models such as SSMs can leverage computational resources invested in training Transformer-based architectures, highlighting a new avenue for building such models.

Trap-MID: Trapdoor-based Defense against Model Inversion Attacks
Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant threat to the privacy of Deep Neural Networks by recovering training data distribution from well-trained models. While existing defenses often rely on regularization techniques to reduce information leakage, they remain vulnerable to recent attacks. In this paper, we propose the Trapdoor-based Model Inversion Defense (Trap-MID) to mislead MI attacks. A trapdoor is integrated into the model to predict a specific label when the input is injected with the corresponding trigger. Consequently, this trapdoor information serves as the "shortcut" for MI attacks, leading them to extract trapdoor triggers rather than private data. We provide theoretical insights into the impacts of trapdoor's effectiveness and invisibility on deceiving MI attacks. In addition, empirical experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art defense performance of Trap-MID against various MI attacks without the requirements for extra data or large computational overhead.

Treatment of Statistical Estimation Problems in Randomized Smoothing for Adversarial Robustness
Randomized smoothing is a popular certified defense against adversarial attacks. In its essence, we need to solve a problem of  statistical estimation which is usually very time-consuming since we need to perform numerous (usually $10^5$) forward passes of the classifier for every point to be certified. In this paper, we review the statistical estimation problems for randomized smoothing to find out if the computational burden is necessary.  In particular, we consider the (standard) task of adversarial robustness where we need to decide if a point is robust at a certain radius or not using as few samples as possible while maintaining statistical guarantees.  We present estimation procedures employing confidence sequences enjoying the same statistical guarantees as the standard methods, with the optimal sample complexities for the estimation task and empirically demonstrate their good performance. Additionally, we provide a randomized version of Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals resulting in strictly stronger certificates.

Treeffuser: probabilistic prediction via conditional diffusions with gradient-boosted trees
Probabilistic prediction aims to compute predictive distributions rather than single point predictions. These distributions enable practitioners to quantify uncertainty, compute risk, and detect outliers. However, most probabilistic methods assume parametric responses, such as Gaussian or Poisson distributions. When these assumptions fail, such models lead to bad predictions and poorly calibrated uncertainty.  In this paper, we propose Treeffuser, an easy-to-use method for probabilistic prediction on tabular data. The idea is to learn a conditional diffusion model where the score function is estimated using gradient-boosted trees. The conditional diffusion model makes Treeffuser flexible and non-parametric, while the gradient-boosted trees make it robust and easy to train on CPUs. Treeffuser learns well-calibrated predictive distributions and can handle a wide range of regression tasks---including those with multivariate, multimodal, and skewed responses. We study Treeffuser on synthetic and real data and show that it outperforms existing methods, providing better calibrated probabilistic predictions. We further demonstrate its versatility with an application to inventory allocation under uncertainty using sales data from Walmart. We implement Treeffuser in [repo].

Truncated Variance Reduced Value Iteration
We provide faster randomized algorithms for computing an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in a discounted Markov decision process with $A_{\text{tot}}$-state-action pairs, bounded rewards, and discount factor $\gamma$. We provide an $\tilde{O}(A_{\text{tot}}[(1 - \gamma)^{-3}\epsilon^{-2} + (1 - \gamma)^{-2}])$-time algorithm in the sampling setting, where the probability transition matrix is unknown but accessible through a generative model which can be queried in $\tilde{O}(1)$-time, and an $\tilde{O}(s +  (1-\gamma)^{-2})$-time algorithm in the offline setting where the probability transition matrix is known and $s$-sparse. These results improve upon the prior state-of-the-art which either ran in $\tilde{O}(A_{\text{tot}}[(1 - \gamma)^{-3}\epsilon^{-2} + (1 - \gamma)^{-3}])$ time [Sidford, Wang, Wu, Ye 2018] in the sampling setting, $\tilde{O}(s + A_{\text{tot}} (1-\gamma)^{-3})$ time [Sidford, Wang, Wu, Yang, Ye 2018] in the offline setting, or time at least quadratic in the number of states using interior point methods for linear programming. We achieve our results by building upon prior stochastic variance-reduced value iteration methods [Sidford, Wang, Wu, Yang, Ye 2018]. We provide a variant that carefully truncates the progress of its iterates to improve the variance of new variance-reduced sampling procedures that we introduce to implement the steps. Our method is essentially model-free and can be implemented in $\tilde{O}(A_{\text{tot}})$-space when given generative model access. Consequently, our results take a step in closing the sample-complexity gap between model-free and model-based methods.

U-DiTs: Downsample Tokens in U-Shaped Diffusion Transformers
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) introduce the transformer architecture to diffusion tasks for latent-space image generation. With an isotropic architecture that chains a series of transformer blocks, DiTs demonstrate competitive performance and good scalability; but meanwhile, the abandonment of U-Net by DiTs and their following improvements is worth rethinking. To this end, we conduct a simple toy experiment by comparing a U-Net architectured DiT with an isotropic one. It turns out that the U-Net architecture only gain a slight advantage amid the U-Net inductive bias, indicating potential redundancies within the U-Net-style DiT. Inspired by the discovery that U-Net backbone features are low-frequency-dominated, we perform token downsampling on the query-key-value tuple for self-attention and bring further improvements despite a considerable amount of reduction in computation. Based on self-attention with downsampled tokens, we propose a series of U-shaped DiTs (U-DiTs) in the paper and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the extraordinary performance of U-DiT models. The proposed U-DiT could outperform DiT-XL with only 1/6 of its computation cost.

UDON: Universal Dynamic Online distillatioN for generic image representations
Universal image representations are critical in enabling real-world fine-grained and instance-level recognition applications, where objects and entities from any domain must be identified at large scale.Despite recent advances, existing methods fail to capture important domain-specific knowledge, while also ignoring differences in data distribution across different domains.This leads to a large performance gap between efficient universal solutions and expensive approaches utilising a collection of specialist models, one for each domain.In this work, we make significant strides towards closing this gap, by introducing a new learning technique, dubbed UDON (Universal Dynamic Online distillatioN).UDON employs multi-teacher distillation, where each teacher is specialized in one domain, to transfer detailed domain-specific knowledge into the student universal embedding.UDON's distillation approach is not only effective, but also very efficient, by sharing most model parameters between the student and all teachers, where all models are jointly trained in an online manner.UDON also comprises a sampling technique which adapts the training process to dynamically allocate batches to domains which are learned slower and require more frequent processing.This boosts significantly the learning of complex domains which are characterised by a large number of classes and long-tail distributions.With comprehensive experiments, we validate each component of UDON, and showcase significant improvements over the state of the art in the recent UnED benchmark.Code will be released.

UDPM: Upsampling Diffusion Probabilistic Models
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) have recently gained significant attention. DDPMs compose a Markovian process that begins in the data domain and gradually adds noise until reaching pure white noise. DDPMs generate high-quality samples from complex data distributions by defining an inverse process and training a deep neural network to learn this mapping. However, these models are inefficient because they require many diffusion steps to produce aesthetically pleasing samples. Additionally, unlike generative adversarial networks (GANs), the latent space of diffusion models is less interpretable. In this work, we propose to generalize the denoising diffusion process into an Upsampling Diffusion Probabilistic Model (UDPM). In the forward process, we reduce the latent variable dimension through downsampling, followed by the traditional noise perturbation. As a result, the reverse process gradually denoises and upsamples the latent variable to produce a sample from the data distribution. We formalize the Markovian diffusion processes of UDPM and demonstrate its generation capabilities on the popular FFHQ, AFHQv2, and CIFAR10 datasets. UDPM generates images with as few as three network evaluations, whose overall computational cost is less than a single DDPM or EDM step, while achieving an FID score of 6.86. This surpasses current state-of-the-art efficient diffusion models that use a single denoising step for sampling. Additionally, UDPM offers an interpretable and interpolable latent space, which gives it an advantage over traditional DDPMs.

UGC: Universal Graph Coarsening
In the era of big data, graphs have emerged as a natural representation of intricate relationships. However, graph sizes often become unwieldy, leading to storage, computation, and analysis challenges. A crucial demand arises for methods that can effectively downsize large graphs while retaining vital insights. Graph coarsening seeks to simplify large graphs while maintaining essential features. Most published methods are suitable for homophilic datasets, limiting their universal use. We propose **U**niversal **G**raph **C**oarsening (UGC), a framework equally suitable for homophilic and heterophilic datasets. UGC integrates node attributes and adjacency information, leveraging the dataset's heterophily factor. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UGC preserves spectral similarity while coarsening. In comparison to existing methods, UGC is 4$\times$ to 15$\times$ faster, has lower eigen-error, and yields superior performance on downstream processing tasks even at 70% coarsening ratios.

UltraPixel: Advancing Ultra High-Resolution Image Synthesis to New Peaks
Ultra-high-resolution image generation poses great challenges, such as increased semantic planning complexity and detail synthesis difficulties, alongside substantial training resource demands. We present UltraPixel, a novel architecture utilizing cascade diffusion models to generate high-quality images at multiple resolutions (\textit{e.g.}, 1K, 2K, and 4K) within a single model, while maintaining computational efficiency. UltraPixel leverages semantics-rich representations of lower-resolution images in a later denoising stage to guide the whole generation of highly detailed high-resolution images, significantly reducing complexity. Specifically, we introduce implicit neural representations for continuous upsampling and scale-aware normalization layers adaptable to various resolutions. Notably, both low- and high-resolution processes are performed in the most compact space, sharing the majority of parameters with less than 3$\%$ additional parameters for high-resolution outputs, largely enhancing training and inference efficiency. Our model achieves fast training with reduced data requirements, producing photo-realistic high-resolution images and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments.

Uncertainty-aware Fine-tuning of Segmentation Foundation Models
The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a large-scale foundation model that has revolutionized segmentation methodology. Despite its impressive generalization ability, the segmentation accuracy of SAM on images with intricate structures is often unsatisfactory. Recent works have proposed lightweight fine-tuning using high-quality annotated data to improve accuracy on such images. However, here we provide extensive empirical evidence that this strategy leads to forgetting how to "segment anything": these models lose the original generalization abilities of SAM, in the sense that they perform worse for segmentation tasks not represented in the annotated fine-tuning set. To improve performance without forgetting, we introduce a novel framework that combines high-quality annotated data with a large unlabeled dataset. The framework relies on two methodological innovations. First, we quantify the uncertainty in the SAM pseudo labels associated with the unlabeled data and leverage it to perform uncertainty-aware fine-tuning. Second, we encode the type of segmentation task associated with each training example using a \textit{task prompt} to reduce ambiguity. We evaluated the proposed Segmentation with Uncertainty Model (SUM) on a diverse test set consisting of 14 public benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, our method consistently surpasses SAM by 3-6 points in mean IoU and 4-7 in mean boundary IoU across point-prompt interactive segmentation rounds.

Uncertainty-based Offline Variational Bayesian Reinforcement Learning for Robustness under Diverse Data Corruptions
Real-world offline datasets are often subject to data corruptions (such as noise or adversarial attacks) due to sensor failures or malicious attacks. Despite advances in robust offline reinforcement learning (RL), existing methods struggle to learn robust agents under high uncertainty caused by the diverse corrupted data (i.e., corrupted states, actions, rewards, and dynamics), leading to performance degradation in clean environments. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel robust variational Bayesian inference for offline RL (TRACER). It introduces Bayesian inference for the first time to capture the uncertainty via offline data for robustness against all types of data corruptions. Specifically, TRACER first models all corruptions as the uncertainty in the action-value function. Then, to capture such uncertainty, it uses all offline data as the observations to approximate the posterior distribution of the action-value function under a Bayesian inference framework. An appealing feature of TRACER is that it can distinguish corrupted data from clean data using an entropy-based uncertainty measure, since corrupted data often induces higher uncertainty and entropy. Based on the aforementioned measure, TRACER can regulate the loss associated with corrupted data to reduce its influence, thereby enhancing robustness and performance in clean environments. Experiments demonstrate that TRACER significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches across both individual and simultaneous data corruptions.

Uncovering the Redundancy in Graph Self-supervised Learning Models
Graph self-supervised learning, as a powerful pre-training paradigm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) without labels, has received considerable attention. We have witnessed the success of graph self-supervised learning on pre-training the parameters of GNNs, leading many not to doubt that whether the learned GNNs parameters are all useful. In this paper, by presenting the experimental evidence and analysis, we surprisingly discover that the graph self-supervised learning models are highly redundant at both of neuron and layer levels, e.g., even randomly removing 51.6\% of parameters, the performance of graph self-supervised learning models still retains at least 96.2\%. This discovery implies that the parameters of graph self-supervised models can be largely reduced, making simultaneously fine-tuning both graph self-supervised learning models and prediction layers more feasible. Therefore, we further design a novel graph pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm called SLImming DE-correlation Fine-tuning (SLIDE). The effectiveness of SLIDE is verified through extensive experiments on various benchmarks, and the performance can be even improved with fewer parameters of models in most cases. For example, in comparison with full fine-tuning GraphMAE on Amazon-Computers dataset, even randomly reducing 40\% of parameters, we can still achieve the improvement of 0.24\% and 0.27\% for Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 scores respectively.

Understanding and Improving Adversarial Collaborative Filtering for Robust Recommendation
Adversarial Collaborative Filtering (ACF), which typically applies adversarial perturbations at user and item embeddings through adversarial training, is widely recognized as an effective strategy for enhancing the robustness of Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems against poisoning attacks. Besides, numerous studies have empirically shown that ACF can also improve recommendation performance compared to traditional CF. Despite these empirical successes, the theoretical understanding of ACF's effectiveness in terms of both performance and robustness remains unclear. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we first theoretically show that ACF can achieve a lower recommendation error compared to traditional CF with the same training epochs in both clean and poisoned data contexts. Furthermore, by establishing bounds for reductions in recommendation error during ACF's optimization process, we find that applying personalized perturbation magnitudes for different users based on their embedding scales can further improve ACF's effectiveness. Building on these theoretical understandings, we propose Personalized Magnitude Adversarial Collaborative Filtering (PamaCF). Extensive experiments demonstrate that PamaCF effectively defends against various types of poisoning attacks while significantly enhancing recommendation performance.

Understanding and Minimising Outlier Features in Neural Network Training
Outlier Features (OF) are neurons whose activation magnitudes significantly exceed the average over a neural network's (NN) width. They are well known to emerge during standard transformer training and have the undesirable effect of hindering quantisation in afflicted models. Despite their practical importance, little is known behind why OFs emerge during training, nor how one can minimise them.Our work focuses on the above questions, first identifying several quantitative metrics, such as the kurtosis over neuron activation norms, to measure OFs. With these metrics, we study how architectural and optimisation choices influence OFs, and provide practical insights to minimise OFs during training. As highlights, we emphasise the importance of controlling signal propagation throughout training, and propose the Outlier Protected transformer block, which removes standard Pre-Norm layers to mitigate OFs, without loss of convergence speed or training stability. Overall, our findings shed new light on our understanding of, our ability to prevent, and the complexity of this important facet in NN training dynamics.

Understanding Generalizability of Diffusion Models Requires Rethinking the Hidden Gaussian Structure
Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a highly effective new class of deep generative models, demonstrating exceptional generation performance. In this work, we study the generalizability (i.e., be able to generate new samples) of diffusion models  by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. Notably, we observe that the nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit strong linearity when the diffusion model is able to generalize. This discovery leads us to approximate their function mappings with linear models, which serve as the first-order approximation of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that the diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. Our experiment results show that this inductive bias becomes more pronounced when the model capacity is relatively small compared to the size of the training dataset. However, even the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalizability recently observed in real-world diffusion models.

Understanding Hallucinations in Diffusion Models through Mode Interpolation
Colloquially speaking, image generation models based upon diffusion processes are frequently said to exhibit ''hallucinations'' samples that could never occur in the training data.  But where do such hallucinations come from? In this paper, we study a particular failure mode in diffusion models, which we term ***mode interpolation***.  Specifically, we find that diffusion models smoothly ``interpolate'' between nearby data modes in the training set, to generate samples that are completely outside the support of the original training distribution; this phenomenon leads diffusion models to generate artifacts that never existed in real data (i.e., hallucinations). We systematically study the reasons for, and the manifestation of this phenomenon. Through experiments on 1D and 2D Gaussians, we show how a discontinuous loss landscape in the diffusion model's decoder leads to a region where any smooth approximation will cause such hallucinations. Through experiments on artificial datasets with various shapes, we show how hallucination leads to the generation of combinations of shapes that never existed. Finally, we show that diffusion models in fact ***know*** when they go out of support and hallucinate. This is captured by the high variance in the trajectory of the generated sample towards the final few backward sampling process. Using a simple metric to capture this variance, we can remove over 95\% of hallucinations at generation time. We conclude our exploration by showing the implications of such hallucination (and its removal) on the collapse (and stabilization) of recursive training on synthetic data with experiments on datasets like MNIST .

Understanding Linear Probing then Fine-tuning Language Models from NTK Perspective
The two-stage fine-tuning (FT) method, linear probing then fine-tuning (LP-FT), consistently outperforms linear probing (LP) and FT alone in terms of accuracy for both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This success is largely attributed to the preservation of pre-trained features, achieved through a near-optimal linear head obtained during LP. However, despite the widespread use of large language models, the exploration of complex architectures such as Transformers remains limited. In this paper, we analyze the training dynamics of LP-FT for classification models on the basis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory. Our analysis decomposes the NTK matrix into two components, highlighting the importance of the linear head norm alongside the prediction accuracy at the start of the FT stage. We also observe a significant increase in the linear head norm during LP, stemming from training with the cross-entropy (CE) loss, which effectively minimizes feature changes. Furthermore, we find that this increased norm can adversely affect model calibration, a challenge that can be addressed by temperature scaling. Additionally, we extend our analysis with the NTK to the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method and validate its effectiveness. Our experiments with a Transformer-based model on natural language processing tasks across multiple benchmarks confirm our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of LP-FT in fine-tuning language models.

Understanding Multi-Granularity for Open-Vocabulary Part Segmentation
Open-vocabulary part segmentation (OVPS) is an emerging research area focused on segmenting fine-grained entities based on diverse and previously unseen vocabularies.Our study highlights the inherent complexities of part segmentation due to intricate boundaries and diverse granularity, reflecting the knowledge-based nature of part identification.To address these challenges, we propose PartCLIPSeg, a novel framework utilizing generalized parts and object-level contexts to mitigate the lack of generalization in fine-grained parts.PartCLIPSeg integrates competitive part relationships and attention control techniques, alleviating ambiguous boundaries and underrepresented parts.Experimental results demonstrate that PartCLIPSeg outperforms existing state-of-the-art OVPS methods, offering refined segmentation and an advanced understanding of part relationships in images.Through extensive experiments, our model demonstrated an improvement over the state-of-the-art models on the Pascal-Part-116, ADE20K-Part-234, and PartImageNet datasets.Our code will be available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/part-clipseg-A526

Understanding Representation of Deep Equilibrium Models from Neural Collapse Perspective
Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ), which serves as a typical implicit neural network, emphasizes their memory efficiency and competitive performance compared to explicit neural networks. However, there has been relatively limited theoretical analysis on the representation of DEQ. In this paper, we utilize the Neural Collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) as a tool to systematically analyze the representation of DEQ under both balanced and imbalanced conditions. $\mathcal{NC}$ is an interesting phenomenon in the neural network training process that characterizes the geometry of class features and classifier weights. While extensively studied in traditional explicit neural networks, the $\mathcal{NC}$ phenomenon has not received substantial attention in the context of implicit neural networks. We theoretically show that $\mathcal{NC}$ exists in DEQ under balanced conditions. Moreover, in imbalanced settings, despite the presence of minority collapse, DEQ demonstrated advantages over explicit neural networks. These advantages include the convergence of extracted features to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame and self-duality properties under mild conditions, highlighting DEQ's superiority in handling imbalanced datasets. Finally, we validate our theoretical analyses through experiments in both balanced and imbalanced scenarios.

Understanding the Expressive Power and Mechanisms of Transformer for Sequence Modeling
We conduct a systematic study of the approximation properties of Transformer for sequence modeling with long, sparse and complicated memory. We investigate the mechanisms through which different components of Transformer, such as the dot-product self-attention, positional encoding and feed-forward layer, affect its expressive power, and we study their combined effects through establishing explicit approximation rates.Our study reveals the roles of critical parameters in the Transformer, such as the number of layers and the number of attention heads.These theoretical insights are validated experimentally and offer natural suggestions for alternative architectures.

Understanding the expressivity and trainability of Fourier Neural Operator
In this paper, we explores the expressivity and trainability of the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). We establish a mean-field theory for the FNO, analyzing the behavior of the random FNO from an \emph{edge of chaos} perspective. Our investigation into the expressivity of a random FNO involves examining the ordered-chaos phase transition of the network based on the weight distribution. This phase transition demonstrates characteristics unique to the FNO, induced by mode truncation, while also showcasing similarities to those of densely connected networks. Furthermore, we identify a connection between expressivity and trainability: the ordered and chaotic phases correspond to regions of vanishing and exploding gradients, respectively. This finding provides a practical prerequisite for the stable training of the FNO. Our experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings.

Understanding the Gains from Repeated Self-Distillation
Self-Distillation is a special type of knowledge distillation where the student model has the same architecture as the teacher model. Despite using the same architecture and the same training data, self-distillation has been empirically observed to improve performance, especially when applied repeatedly. For such a process, there is a fundamental question of interest: How much gain is possible by applying multiple steps of self-distillation? To investigate this relative gain, we propose using the simple but canonical task of linear regression. Our analysis shows that the excess risk achieved by multi-step self-distillation can significantly improve upon a single step of self-distillation, reducing the excess risk by a factor of $d$, where $d$ is the input dimension. Empirical results on regression tasks from the UCI repository show a reduction in the learnt model's risk (MSE) by up to $47$%.

Understanding the Role of Equivariance in Self-supervised Learning
Contrastive learning has been a leading paradigm for self-supervised learning, but it is widely observed that it comes at the price of sacrificing useful features (e.g., colors) by being invariant to data augmentations. Given this limitation, there has been a surge of interest in equivariant self-supervised learning (E-SSL) that learns features to be augmentation-aware. However, even for the simplest rotation prediction method, there is a lack of rigorous understanding of why, when, and how E-SSL learns useful features for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we establish an information-theoretic perspective to understand the generalization ability of E-SSL. In particular, we identify a critical explaining-away effect in E-SSL that creates a synergy between the equivariant and classification tasks. This synergy effect encourages models to extract class-relevant features to improve its equivariant prediction, which, in turn, benefits downstream tasks requiring semantic features. Based on this perspective, we theoretically analyze the influence of data transformations and reveal several principles for practical designs of E-SSL. Our theory not only aligns well with existing E-SSL methods but also sheds light on new directions by exploring the benefits of model equivariance. We believe that a theoretically grounded understanding on the role of equivariance would inspire more principled and advanced designs in this field.

Understanding the Transferability of Representations via Task-Relatedness
The growing popularity of transfer learning due to the availability of models pre-trained on vast amounts of data, makes it imperative to understand when the knowledge of these pre-trained models can be transferred to obtain high-performing models on downstream target tasks. However, the exact conditions under which transfer learning succeeds in a cross-domain cross-task setting are still poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel analysis that analyzes the transferability of the representations of pre-trained models to downstream tasks in terms of their relatedness to a given reference task. Our analysis leads to an upper bound on transferability in terms of task-relatedness, quantified using the difference between the class priors, label sets, and features of the two tasks.Our experiments using state-of-the-art pre-trained models show the effectiveness of task-relatedness in explaining transferability on various vision and language tasks. The efficient computability of task-relatedness even without labels of the target task and its high correlation with the model's accuracy after end-to-end fine-tuning on the target task makes it a useful metric for transferability estimation. Our empirical results of using task-relatedness on the problem of selecting the best pre-trained model from a model zoo for a target task highlight its utility for practical problems.

Understanding Transformer Reasoning Capabilities via Graph Algorithms
Which transformer scaling regimes are able to perfectly solve different classes of algorithmic problems?   While tremendous empirical advances have been attained by transformer-based neural networks, a theoretical understanding of their algorithmic reasoning capabilities in realistic parameter regimes is lacking.  We investigate this question in terms of the network’s depth, width, and number of extra tokens for algorithm execution.  Our novel representational hierarchy separates 9 algorithmic reasoning problems into classes solvable by transformers in different realistic parameter scaling regimes.  We prove that logarithmic depth is necessary and sufficient for tasks like graph connectivity, while single-layer transformers with small embedding dimensions can solve contextual retrieval tasks. We also support our theoretical analysis with ample empirical evidence using the GraphQA benchmark.  These results show that transformers excel at many graph reasoning tasks, even outperforming specialized graph neural networks.

Understanding Transformers via N-Gram Statistics
Transformer based large-language models display extreme proficiency with language yet a precise understanding of how they work remains elusive. One way of demystifying transformer predictions would be to describe how they depend on their context in terms of simple template functions. This paper takes a first step in this direction by considering families of functions (i.e. rules) formed out of simple N-gram based statistics of the training data. By studying how well these rulesets approximate transformer predictions, we obtain a variety of novel discoveries: a simple method to detect overfitting during training without using a holdout set, a quantative measure of how transformers progress from learning simple to more complex statistical rules over the course of training, a model-variance criterion governing when transformer predictions tend to be described by N-gram rules, and insights into how well transformers can be approximated by N-gram rulesets in the limit where these rulesets become increasingly complex.

Unelicitable Backdoors via Cryptographic Transformer Circuits
The rapid proliferation of open-source language models significantly increases the risks of downstream backdoor attacks. These backdoors can introduce dangerous behaviors during model deployment and can evade detection by conventional cybersecurity monitoring systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of backdoors in autoregressive transformer models, that, in contrast to prior art, are unelicitable in nature. Unelicitability prevents the defender from triggering the backdoor, making it impossible to evaluate or detect ahead of deployment if if given full white-box access and using automated techniques, such as red-teaming or formal verification methods. We show that our novel construction is not only unelicitable thanks to using cryptographic techniques, but also has favourable robustness properties.We confirm these properties in empirical investigations, and show evidence that our backdoors can withstand state-of-the-art mitigation strategies. Additionally, we expand on previous work by showing that our universal backdoors, while not completely undetectable in white-box settings, can be significantly harder to detect than existing approaches. By demonstrating the feasibility of seamlessly integrating backdoors into transformer models, this paper fundamentally questions the efficacy of pre-deployment detection strategies. This offers new insights into the offense-defense balance in AI safety and security.

UniBench: Visual Reasoning Requires Rethinking Vision-Language Beyond Scaling
Significant research efforts have been made to scale and improve vision-language model (VLM) training approaches. Yet, with an ever-growing number of benchmarks,researchers are tasked with the heavy burden of implementing each protocol, bearing a non-trivial computational cost, and making sense of how all these benchmarks translate into meaningful axes of progress.To facilitate a systematic evaluation of VLM progress, we introduce UniBench: a unified implementation of 50+ VLM benchmarks spanning a comprehensive range of carefully categorized capabilities from object recognition to spatial awareness, counting, and much more. We showcase the utility of UniBench for measuring progress by evaluating nearly 60 publicly available vision-language models, trained on scales of up to 12.8B samples. We find that while scaling training data or model size can boost many vision-language model capabilities, scaling offers little benefit for reasoning or relations.  Surprisingly, we also discover today's best VLMs struggle on simple digit recognition and counting tasks, e.g. MNIST, which much simpler networks can solve. Where scale falls short, we find that more precise interventions, such as data quality or tailored-learning objectives offer more promise. For practitioners, we also offer guidance on selecting a suitable VLM for a given application. Finally, we release an easy-to-run UniBench code-base with the full set of 50+ benchmarks and comparisons across 59 models as well as a distilled, representative set of benchmarks that runs in 5 minutes on a single GPU.

Unified Covariate Adjustment for Causal Inference
Causal effect identification and estimation are two crucial tasks in causal inference. Although causal effect identification has been theoretically resolved, many existing estimators only address a subset of scenarios, known as the sequential back-door adjustment (SBD) (Pearl and Robins, 1995) or g-formula (Robins, 1986). Recent efforts for developing general-purpose estimators with broader coverage, incorporating the front-door adjustment (FD) (Pearl, 2000) and more, lack scalability due to the high computational cost of summing over high-dimensional variables. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that achieves broad coverage of causal estimands beyond the SBD, incorporating various sum-product functionals like the FD, while maintaining scalability -- estimated in polynomial time relative to the number of variables and samples. Specifically, we present the class of UCA for which a scalable and doubly robust estimator is developed. In particular, we illustrate the expressiveness of UCA for a wide spectrum of causal estimands (e.g., SBD, FD, and more) in causal inference. We then develop an estimator that exhibits computational efficiency and doubly robustness. The scalability and robustness of the proposed framework are verified through simulations.

Unified Domain Generalization and Adaptation for Multi-View 3D Object Detection
Recent advances in 3D object detection leveraging multi-view cameras have demonstrated their practical and economical value in various challenging vision tasks.However, typical supervised learning approaches face challenges in achieving satisfactory adaptation toward unseen and unlabeled target datasets (ie, direct transfer) due to the inevitable geometric misalignment between the source and target domains.In practice, we also encounter constraints on resources for training models and collecting annotations for the successful deployment of 3D object detectors.In this paper, we propose Unified Domain Generalization and Adaptation (UDGA), a practical solution to mitigate those drawbacks.We first propose Multi-view Overlap Depth Constrain that leveraging the strong association between multi-views, significantly alleviating geometric gaps from perspective view changes.Then, we present a Label-Efficient Domain Adaptation approach to handle unfamiliar targets with significantly fewer amounts of labels (ie, 1% and 5%), while preserving well-defined source knowledge for training efficiency.Overall, UDGA framework enables stable detection performance in both source and target domains, effectively bridging inevitable domain gaps, while demanding fewer annotations.We demonstrate the robustness of UDGA with large-scale benchmarks: nuScenes, Lyft, and Waymo, where our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

Unified Gradient-Based Machine Unlearning with Remain Geometry Enhancement
Machine unlearning (MU) has emerged to enhance the privacy and trustworthiness of deep neural networks. Approximate MU is a practical method for large-scale models. Our investigation into approximate MU starts with identifying the steepest descent direction, minimizing the output Kullback-Leibler divergence to exact MU inside a parameters' neighborhood. This probed direction decomposes into three components: weighted forgetting gradient ascent, fine-tuning retaining gradient descent, and a weight saliency matrix. Such decomposition derived from Euclidean metric encompasses most existing gradient-based MU methods. Nevertheless, adhering to Euclidean space may result in sub-optimal iterative trajectories due to the overlooked geometric structure of the output probability space. We suggest embedding the unlearning update into a manifold rendered by the remaining geometry, incorporating second-order Hessian from the remaining data. It helps prevent effective unlearning from interfering with the retained performance. However, computing the second-order Hessian for large-scale models is intractable. To efficiently leverage the benefits of Hessian modulation, we propose a fast-slow parameter update strategy to implicitly approximate the up-to-date salient unlearning direction.Free from specific modal constraints, our approach is adaptable across all computer vision unlearning tasks. Extensive experiments validate our efficacy and efficiency. Notably, our method successfully performs class-forgetting on ImageNet using DiT and forgets a class on CIFAR-10 using DDPM in just 50 steps, compared to thousands of steps required by previous methods.

Unified Guidance for Geometry-Conditioned Molecular Generation
Effectively designing molecular geometries is essential to advancing pharmaceutical innovations, a domain, which has experienced great attention through the success of generative models and, in particular, diffusion models. However, current molecular diffusion models are tailored towards a specific downstream task and lack adaptability. We introduce UniGuide, a framework for controlled geometric guidance of unconditional diffusion models that allows flexible conditioning during inference without the requirement of extra training or networks. We show how applications such as structure-based, fragment-based, and ligand-based drug design are formulated in the UniGuide framework and demonstrate on-par or superior performance compared to specialised models. Offering a more versatile approach, UniGuide has the potential to streamline the development of molecular generative models, allowing them to be readily used in diverse application scenarios.

Unified Insights: Harnessing Multi-modal Data for Phenotype Imputation via View Decoupling
Phenotype imputation plays a crucial role in improving comprehensive and accurate medical evaluation, which in turn can optimize patient treatment and bolster the reliability of clinical research. Despite the adoption of various techniques, multi-modal biological data, which can provide crucial insights into a patient's overall health, is often overlooked. With multi-modal biological data, patient characterization can be enriched from two distinct views: the biological view and the phenotype view. However, the heterogeneity and imprecise nature of the multimodal data still pose challenges in developing an effective method to model from two views. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to incorporate multi-modal biological data via view decoupling. Specifically, we segregate the modeling of biological data from phenotype data in a graph-based learning framework. From the biological view, the latent factors in biological data are discovered to model patient correlation. From the phenotype view, phenotype co-occurrence can be modeled to reveal patterns across patients. Then patients are encoded from these two distinct views. To mitigate the influence of noise and irrelevant information in biological data, we devise a cross-view contrastive knowledge distillation aimed at distilling insights from the biological view to enhance phenotype imputation. We show that phenotype imputation with the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on the real-world biomedical database.

UniFL: Improve Stable Diffusion via Unified Feedback Learning
Diffusion models have revolutionized the field of image generation, leading to the proliferation of high-quality models and diverse downstream applications. However, despite these significant advancements, the current competitive solutions still suffer from several limitations, including inferior visual quality, a lack of aesthetic appeal, and inefficient inference, without a comprehensive solution in sight. To address these challenges, we present \textit{\textbf{UniFL}}, a unified framework that leverages feedback learning to enhance diffusion models comprehensively. UniFL stands out as a universal, effective, and generalizable solution applicable to various diffusion models, such as SD1.5 and SDXL.Notably, UniFL incorporates three key components: perceptual feedback learning, which enhances visual quality; decoupled feedback learning, which improves aesthetic appeal; and adversarial feedback learning, which accelerates inference.In-depth experiments and extensive user studies validate the superior performance of our proposed method in enhancing both the quality of generated models and their acceleration. For instance, UniFL surpasses ImageReward by \textbf{17\%} user preference in terms of generation quality and outperforms LCM and SDXL Turbo by \textbf{57\%} and \textbf{20\%} with 4-step inference.

Unifying Generation and Prediction on Graphs with Latent Graph Diffusion
In this paper, we propose the first framework that enables solving graph learning tasks of all levels (node, edge and graph) and all types (generation, regression and classification) with one model. We first formulate prediction tasks including regression and classification as (conditional) generation, which is a generic formulation that enables diffusion models to perform deterministic tasks with provable guarantees. We then propose Latent Graph Diffusion (LGD), a generative model that can generate node, edge, and graph-level features of all categories simultaneously. We achieve this goal by embedding the graph structures and features into a latent space leveraging a powerful encoder which can also be decoded, then training a diffusion model in the latent space. LGD is also capable of conditional generation through a specifically designed cross-attention mechanism. Leveraging LGD and the unified ``all tasks as generation'' formulation, our framework is capable of solving tasks of all levels and all types. We verify the effectiveness of our framework with extensive experiments, where our models achieve state-of-the-art or highly competitive results across a wide range of generation and regression tasks.

Unifying Homophily and Heterophily for Spectral Graph Neural Networks via Triple Filter Ensembles
Polynomial-based learnable spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) utilize polynomial to approximate graph convolutions and have achieved impressive performance on graphs. Nevertheless, there are three progressive problems to be solved. Some models use polynomials with better approximation for approximating filters, yet perform worse on real-world graphs. Carefully crafted graph learning methods, sophisticated polynomial approximations, and refined coefficient constraints leaded to overfitting, which diminishes the generalization of the models. How to design a model that retains the ability of polynomial-based spectral GNNs to approximate filters while it possesses higher generalization and performance? In this paper, we propose a spectral GNN with triple filter ensemble (TFE-GNN), which extracts homophily and heterophily from graphs with different levels of homophily adaptively while utilizing the initial features. Specifically, the first and second ensembles are combinations of a set of base low-pass and high-pass filters, respectively, after which the third ensemble combines them with two learnable coefficients and yield a graph convolution (TFE-Conv). Theoretical analysis shows that the approximation ability of TFE-GNN is consistent with that of ChebNet under certain conditions, namely it can learn arbitrary filters. TFE-GNN can be viewed as a reasonable combination of two unfolded and integrated excellent spectral GNNs, which motivates it to perform well. Experiments show that TFE-GNN achieves high generalization and new state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets.

Unique3D: High-Quality and Efficient 3D Mesh Generation from a Single Image
In this work, we introduce Unique3D, a novel image-to-3D framework for efficiently generating high-quality 3D meshes from single-view images, featuring state-of-the-art generation fidelity and strong generalizability. Previous methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) can produce diversified 3D results by distilling 3D knowledge from large 2D diffusion models, but they usually suffer from long per-case optimization time with inconsistent issues. Recent works address the problem and generate better 3D results either by finetuning a multi-view diffusion model or training a fast feed-forward model. However, they still lack intricate textures and complex geometries due to inconsistency and limited generated resolution. To simultaneously achieve high fidelity, consistency, and efficiency in single image-to-3D, we propose a novel framework Unique3D that includes a multi-view diffusion model with a corresponding normal diffusion model to generate multi-view images with their normal maps, a multi-level upscale process to progressively improve the resolution of generated orthographic multi-views, as well as an instant and consistent mesh reconstruction algorithm called ISOMER, which fully integrates the color and geometric priors into mesh results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Unique3D significantly outperforms other image-to-3D baselines in terms of geometric and textural details.

UniSDF: Unifying Neural Representations for High-Fidelity 3D Reconstruction of Complex Scenes with Reflections
Neural 3D scene representations have shown great potential for 3D reconstruction from 2D images. However, reconstructing real-world captures of complex scenes still remains a challenge. Existing generic 3D reconstruction methods often struggle to represent fine geometric details and do not adequately model reflective surfaces of large-scale scenes. Techniques that explicitly focus on reflective surfaces can model complex and detailed reflections by exploiting better reflection parameterizations. However, we observe that these methods are often not robust in real scenarios where non-reflective as well as reflective components are present. In this work, we propose UniSDF, a general purpose 3D reconstruction method that can reconstruct large complex scenes with reflections. We investigate both camera view as well as reflected view-based color parameterization techniques and find that explicitly blending these representations in 3D space enables reconstruction of surfaces that are more geometrically accurate, especially for reflective surfaces. We further combine this representation with a multi-resolution grid backbone that is trained in a coarse-to-fine manner, enabling faster reconstructions than prior methods. Extensive experiments on object-level datasets DTU, Shiny Blender as well as unbounded datasets Mip-NeRF 360 and Ref-NeRF real demonstrate that our method is able to robustly reconstruct complex large-scale scenes with fine details and reflective surfaces, leading to the best overall performance.

Unitary Convolutions for Learning on Graphs and Groups
Data with geometric structure is ubiquitous in machine learning often arising from fundamental symmetries in a domain, such as permutation-invariance in graphs and translation-invariance in images. Group-convolutional architectures, which encode symmetries as inductive bias, have shown great success in applications, but can suffer from instabilities as their depth increases and often struggle to learn long range dependencies in data. For instance, graph neural networks experience instability due to the convergence of node representations (over-smoothing), which can occur after only a few iterations of message-passing, reducing their effectiveness in downstream tasks. Here, we propose and study unitary group convolutions, which allow for deeper networks that are more stable during training. The main focus of the paper are graph neural networks, where we show that unitary graph convolutions provably avoid over-smoothing. Our experimental results confirm that unitary graph convolutional networks achieve competitive performance on benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art graph neural networks. We complement our analysis of the graph domain with the study of general unitary convolutions and analyze their role in enhancing stability in general group convolutional architectures.

United We Stand, Divided We Fall: Fingerprinting Deep Neural Networks via Adversarial Trajectories
In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have witnessed extensive applications, and protecting their intellectual property (IP) is thus crucial. As a non-invasive way for model IP protection, model fingerprinting has become popular. However, existing single-point based fingerprinting methods are highly sensitive to the changes in the decision boundary, and may suffer from the misjudgment of the resemblance of sparse fingerprinting, yielding high false positives of innocent models. In this paper, we propose ADV-TRA, a more robust fingerprinting scheme that utilizes adversarial trajectories to verify the ownership of DNN models. Benefited from the intrinsic progressively adversarial level, the trajectory is capable of tolerating greater degree of alteration in decision boundaries. We further design novel schemes to generate a surface trajectory that involves a series of fixed-length trajectories with dynamically adjusted step sizes. Such a design enables a more unique and reliable fingerprinting with relatively low querying costs. Experiments on three datasets against four types of removal attacks show that ADV-TRA exhibits superior performance in distinguishing between infringing and innocent models, outperforming the state-of-the-art comparisons.

UNIT: Unifying Image and Text Recognition in One Vision Encoder
Currently, vision encoder models like Vision Transformers (ViTs) typically excel at image recognition tasks but cannot simultaneously support text recognition like human visual recognition. To address this limitation, we propose UNIT, a novel training framework aimed at UNifying Image and Text recognition within a single model. Starting with a vision encoder pre-trained with image recognition tasks, UNIT introduces a lightweight language decoder for predicting text outputs and a lightweight vision decoder to prevent catastrophic forgetting of the original image encoding capabilities. The training process comprises two stages: intra-scale pretraining and inter-scale finetuning. During intra-scale pretraining, UNIT learns unified representations from multi-scale inputs, where images and documents are at their commonly used resolution, to enable fundamental recognition capability. In the inter-scale finetuning stage, the model introduces scale-exchanged data, featuring images and documents at resolutions different from the most commonly used ones, to enhance its scale robustness. Notably, UNIT retains the original vision encoder architecture, making it cost-free in terms of inference and deployment. Experiments across multiple benchmarks confirm that our method significantly outperforms existing methods on document-related tasks (e.g., OCR and DocQA) while maintaining the performances on natural images, demonstrating its ability to substantially enhance text recognition without compromising its core image recognition capabilities.

Unity by Diversity: Improved Representation Learning for Multimodal VAEs
Variational Autoencoders for multimodal data hold promise for many tasks in data analysis, such as representation learning, conditional generation, and imputation.Current architectures either share the encoder output, decoder input, or both across modalities to learn a shared representation. Such architectures impose hard constraints on the model. In this work, we show that a better latent representation can be obtained by replacing these hard constraints with a soft constraint. We propose a new mixture-of-experts prior, softly guiding each modality's latent representation towards a shared aggregate posterior.This approach results in a superior latent representation and allows each encoding to preserve information better from its uncompressed original features. In extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and two challenging real-world datasets, we show improved learned latent representations and imputation of missing data modalities compared to existing methods.

Universal In-Context Approximation By Prompting Fully Recurrent Models
Zero-shot and in-context learning enable solving tasks without model fine-tuning, making them essential for developing generative model solutions. Therefore, it is crucial to understand whether a pretrained model can be prompted to approximate any function, i.e., whether it is a universal in-context approximator. While it was recently shown that transformer models do possess this property, these results rely on their attention mechanism. Hence, these findings do not apply to fully recurrent architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, and the increasingly popular SSMs. We demonstrate that RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Linear RNNs, and linear gated architectures such as Mamba and Hawk/Griffin can also serve be universal in-context approximators. To streamline our argument, we introduce a programming language called LSRL that compiles to these fully recurrent architectures. LSRL may be of independent interest for further studies of fully recurrent models, such as constructing interpretability benchmarks. We also study the role of multiplicative gating and observe that architectures incorporating such gating (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, Hawk/Griffin) can implement certain operations more stably, making them more viable candidates for practical in-context universal approximation.

UnlearnCanvas: Stylized Image Dataset for Enhanced Machine Unlearning Evaluation in Diffusion Models
The technological advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in text-to-image generation and are widely used in diverse applications. However, they have also raised significant societal concerns, such as the generation of harmful content and copyright disputes. Machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a promising solution, capable of removing undesired generative capabilities from DMs. However, existing MU evaluation systems present several key challenges that can result in incomplete and inaccurate assessments. To address these issues, we propose UnlearnCanvas, a comprehensive high-resolution stylized image dataset that facilitates the evaluation of the unlearning of artistic styles and associated objects. This dataset enables the establishment of a standardized, automated evaluation framework with 7 quantitative metrics assessing various aspects of the unlearning performance for DMs. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark 9 state-of-the-art MU methods for DMs, revealing novel insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we explore challenging unlearning scenarios for DMs to evaluate worst-case performance against adversarial prompts, the unlearning of finer-scale concepts, and sequential unlearning. We hope that this study can pave the way for developing more effective, accurate, and robust DM unlearning methods, ensuring safer and more ethical applications of DMs in the future. The dataset, benchmark, and codes are publicly available at this [link](https://unlearn-canvas.netlify.app/).

Unleashing the Denoising Capability of Diffusion Prior for Solving Inverse Problems
The recent emergence of diffusion models has significantly advanced the precision of learnable priors, presenting innovative avenues for addressing inverse problems. Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, we efficiently utilize the projection gradient descent method to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

Unlocking the Capabilities of Masked Generative Models for Image Synthesis via Self-Guidance
Masked generative models (MGMs) have shown impressive generative ability while providing an order of magnitude efficient sampling steps compared to continuous diffusion models. However, MGMs still underperform in image synthesis compared to recent well-developed continuous diffusion models with similar size in terms of quality and diversity of generated samples. A key factor in the performance of continuous diffusion models stems from the guidance methods, which enhance the sample quality at the expense of diversity. In this paper, we extend these guidance methods to generalized guidance formulation for MGMs and propose a self-guidance sampling method, which leads to better generation quality and diversity. The proposed approach leverages an auxiliary task for semantic smoothing in vector-quantized token space, analogous to the Gaussian blur in continuous pixel space. Equipped with the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, MGMs with our self-guidance technique achieve a superior quality-diversity trade-off, outperforming existing sampling methods in MGMs with more efficient training and sampling costs. We further extensively experiment with the various sampling hyperparameters, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed guidance.

Unlocking the Potential of Global Human Expertise
Solving societal problems on a global scale requires the collection and processing of ideas and methods from diverse sets of international experts. As the number and diversity of human experts increase, so does the likelihood that elements in this collective knowledge can be combined and refined to discover novel and better solutions. However, it is difficult to identify, combine, and refine complementary information in an increasingly large and diverse knowledge base. This paper argues that artificial intelligence (AI) can play a crucial role in this process. An evolutionary AI framework, termed RHEA, fills this role by distilling knowledge from diverse models created by human experts into equivalent neural networks, which are then recombined and refined in a population-based search. The framework was implemented in a formal synthetic domain, demonstrating that it is transparent and systematic. It was then applied to the results of the XPRIZE Pandemic Response Challenge, in which over 100 teams of experts across 23 countries submitted models based on diverse methodologies to predict COVID-19 cases and suggest non-pharmaceutical intervention policies for 235 nations, states, and regions across the globe. Building upon this expert knowledge, by recombining and refining the 169 resulting policy suggestion models, RHEA discovered a broader and more effective set of policies than either AI or human experts alone, as evaluated based on real-world data. The results thus suggest that AI can play a crucial role in realizing the potential of human expertise in global problem-solving.

Unraveling the Gradient Descent Dynamics of Transformers
While the Transformer architecture has achieved remarkable success across various domains, a thorough theoretical foundation explaining its optimization dynamics is yet to be fully developed. In this study, we aim to bridge this understanding gap by answering the following two core questions: (1) Which types of Transformer architectures allow Gradient Descent (GD) to achieve guaranteed convergence? and (2) Under what initial conditions and architectural specifics does the Transformer achieve rapid convergence during training? By analyzing the loss landscape of a single Transformer layer using Softmax and Gaussian attention kernels, our work provides concrete answers to these questions. Our findings demonstrate that, with appropriate weight initialization, GD can train a Transformer model (with either kernel type) to achieve a global optimal solution, especially when the input embedding dimension is large. Nonetheless, certain scenarios highlight potential pitfalls: training a Transformer using the Softmax attention kernel may sometimes lead to suboptimal local solutions. In contrast,  the Gaussian attention kernel exhibits a much favorable behavior. Our empirical study further validate the theoretical findings.

Unravelling in Collaborative Learning
Collaborative learning offers a promising avenue for leveraging decentralized data. However, collaboration in groups of learners is not a given, as strategic learners may act in a way to maximize their own utility at the expense of a collective utility. In this work, we consider strategic agents who wish to train a model together but have sampling distributions of different quality. The collaboration is organized by a benevolent aggregator who gathers samples so as to maximize total welfare, but is unaware of data quality. This setting allows us to shed light on the deleterious effect of \textit{adverse selection} in collaborative learning. More precisely, we demonstrate that when data quality indices are private, the coalition may undergo a phenomenon known as \emph{unravelling}, wherein it shrinks up to the point that it becomes empty or solely comprised of the worst agent. We show how this issue can be addressed without making use of external transfers, by proposing a novel method inspired by accuracy shaping. This approach makes the truthful, optimal coalition an approximate pure Nash equilibrium with high probability in spite of information asymmetry.

Unrolled denoising networks that provably learn to perform optimal Bayesian inference
Much of Bayesian inference centers around the design of estimators for inverse problems which are optimal assuming the data comes from a certain prior. Where does this prior come from, and what do these optimality guarantees mean if we don't know the prior? In recent years, algorithm unrolling has emerged as deep learning's answer to this age-old question: design a neural network whose layers can in principle simulate iterations of these ``optimal'' inference algorithms, and train the network on data generated by the unknown prior. In practice this method, which is inherently prior-agnostic, performs at least as well and often better than the best hand-crafted, prior-aware algorithms.Despite these empirical successes, it has remained unclear theoretically why this method works well, or what estimators these networks converge to. In this work, we prove the first rigorous learning guarantees for neural networks based on unrolling approximate message passing (AMP). For compressed sensing, we prove that when trained on data coming from a product prior, the layers of the network approximately converge to the same denoisers used in Bayes AMP. We also provide extensive numerical experiments demonstrating the advantages of our unrolled architecture\--- in addition to being able to obliviously adapt to general priors, it can handle more general (e.g. non-sub-Gaussian) measurements and exhibits non-asymptotic improvements over the MSE achieved by Bayes AMP.

Unscrambling disease progression at scale: fast inference of event permutations with optimal transport
Disease progression models infer group-level temporal trajectories of change in patients' features as a chronic degenerative condition plays out. They provide unique insight into disease biology and staging systems with individual-level clinical utility. Discrete models consider disease progression as a latent permutation of events, where each event corresponds to a feature becoming measurably abnormal. However, permutation inference using traditional maximum likelihood approaches becomes prohibitive due to combinatoric explosion, severely limiting model dimensionality and utility. Here we leverage ideas from optimal transport to model disease progression as a latent permutation matrix of events belonging to the Birkhoff polytope, facilitating fast inference via optimisation of the variational lower bound. This enables a factor of 1000 times faster inference than the current state of the art and, correspondingly, supports models with several orders of magnitude more features than the current state of the art can consider. Experiments demonstrate the increase in speed, accuracy and robustness to noise in simulation. Further experiments with real-world imaging data from two separate datasets, one from Alzheimer's disease patients, the other age-related macular degeneration, showcase, for the first time, pixel-level disease progression events in the brain and eye, respectively. Our method is low compute, interpretable and applicable to any progressive condition and data modality, giving it broad potential clinical utility.

UnSeg: One Universal Unlearnable Example Generator is Enough against All Image Segmentation
Image segmentation is a crucial vision task that groups pixels within an image into semantically meaningful segments, which is pivotal in obtaining a fine-grained understanding of real-world scenes. However, an increasing privacy concern exists regarding training large-scale image segmentation models on unauthorized private data. In this work, we exploit the concept of unlearnable examples to make images unusable to model training by generating and adding unlearnable noise into the original images. Particularly, we propose a novel Unlearnable Segmentation (UnSeg) framework to train a universal unlearnable noise generator that is capable of transforming any downstream images into their unlearnable version. The unlearnable noise generator is finetuned from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) via bilevel optimization on an interactive segmentation dataset towards minimizing the training error of a surrogate model that shares the same architecture with SAM (but trains from scratch). We empirically verify the effectiveness of UnSeg across 6 mainstream image segmentation tasks, 10 widely used datasets, and 7 different network architectures, and show that the unlearnable images can reduce the segmentation performance by a large margin. Our work provides useful insights into how to leverage foundation models in a data-efficient and computationally affordable manner to protect images against image segmentation models.

Unsupervised Discovery of Formulas for Mathematical Constants
In recent years, we are witnessing a rise of AI and machine learning methods for scientific discovery and hypothesis creation. Despite the strides in other fields of science, a persistent challenge lies in the creation of formulas for mathematical constants.In the landscape of formula creation, there is no straightforward ‘’distance metric'' between two samples that can guide progress. Formulas are either true or false, with no continuous adjustments that can enhance their correctness.The absence of a systematic method left the realm of formula discovery elusive for automated methods. In this work, we propose a systematic methodology for categorization, characterization, and pattern identification of such formulas. We demonstrate this methodology on Polynomial Continued Fraction formulas, which are ubiquitous in their intrinsic connections to mathematical constants, and generalize many mathematical functions and structures.We discover organizing metrics for the space of polynomial continued fractions. We test our methodology on a set of 1,768,900 such formulas, identifying many known formulas for mathematical constants, and discover previously unknown formulas for $\pi$, $\ln(2)$, Gauss, and Lemniscate constants. The uncovered patterns enable a direct generalization of individual formulas to infinite families, unveiling rich mathematical structures. This success paves the way towards a generative model that creates continued fractions fulfilling requested mathematical properties, potentially accelerating by orders of magnitude the rate of discovery of useful formulas.

Unsupervised Hierarchy-Agnostic Segmentation: Parsing Semantic Image Structure
Unsupervised semantic segmentation aims to discover groupings within images, capturing objects' view-invariance without external supervision. This task is inherently ambiguous due to the variable levels of granularity in natural groupings. Existing methods often bypass this ambiguity using dataset-specific priors. In our research, we address this ambiguity head-on and provide a universal tool for pixel-level semantic parsing of images guided by the latent representations encoded in self-supervised models. We introduce a novel algebraic methodology for unsupervised image segmentation. The innovative approach identifies scene-conditioned primitives within a dataset and creates a hierarchy-agnostic semantic region tree of the image pixels. The method leverages deep feature extractors and graph partitioning techniques to recursively identify latent semantic regions, dynamically estimating the number of components and ensuring smoothness in the partitioning process. In this way, the model captures fine and coarse semantic details, producing a more nuanced and unbiased segmentation. We present a new metric for estimating the quality of the semantic segmentation of elements discovered on the different levels of the hierarchy. The metric is beneficial because it validates the intrinsic nature of the compositional relations among parts, objects, and scenes in a hierarchy-agnostic domain.Our results unequivocally demonstrate the power of this methodology. It uncovers detailed and hierarchical semantic regions without prior definitions and scales effectively across various datasets. This robust framework for unsupervised image segmentation provides richer and more accurate semantic hierarchical relationships between scene elements than traditional algorithms. The experiments underscore its potential for broad applicability in image analysis tasks, showcasing its ability to deliver a detailed and unbiased segmentation that surpasses existing unsupervised methods.

Unsupervised Homography Estimation on Multimodal Image Pair via Alternating Optimization
Estimating the homography between two images is a crucial process for various tasks, such as image stitching, reconstruction. However, applying supervised learning methods is often challenging or expensive due to the difficulty of collecting ground truth data. Consequently, methods based on unsupervised learning have been developed. Most of these methods assume that the given image pairs are from the same camera or have slight differences in lighting. While these studies perform effectively under these assumptions, they generally fail when the input pair images come from different domains, referred to as multimodal image pairs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a learning framework for estimating homography in multimodal image pairs using unsupervised learning, which does not require ground truth. Our method employs a two-phase optimization framework similar to Expectation-Maximization (EM), featuring phases to reduce the geometry gap and to capture the modality gap. To handle these gaps, we also propose to use Barlow Twins loss for modality gap and its extended version, named `Geometry Barlow Twins, for geometry gap. As a result, we have demonstrated that it is possible to train a various architectures of networks to outperform than other unsupervised based methods on multimodal datasets.

Unsupervised Modality Adaptation with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Semantic Segmentation
Despite their success, unsupervised domain adaptation methods for semantic segmentation primarily focus on adaptation between image domains and do not utilize other abundant visual modalities like depth, infrared and event. This limitation hinders their performance and restricts their application in real-world multimodal scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Modality Adaptation with text-to-image Diffusion Models (MADM) for semantic segmentation task which utilizes text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on extensive image-text pairs to enhance the model's cross-modality capabilities. Specifically, MADM comprises two key complementary components to tackle major challenges. First, due to the large modality gap, using one modal data to generate pseudo labels for another modality suffers from a significant drop in accuracy. To address this, MADM designs diffusion-based pseudo-label generation which adds latent noise to stabilize pseudo-labels and enhance label accuracy. Second, to overcome the limitations of latent low-resolution features in diffusion models, MADM introduces the label palette and latent regression which converts one-hot encoded labels into the RGB form by palette and regresses them in the latent space, thus ensuring the pre-trained decoder for up-sampling to obtain fine-grained features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MADM achieves state-of-the-art adaptation performance across various modality tasks, including images to depth, infrared, and event modalities. The code will be released.

Unveil Benign Overfitting for Transformer in Vision: Training Dynamics, Convergence, and Generalization
Transformers have demonstrated great power in the recent development of large foundational models. In particular, the Vision Transformer (ViT) has brought revolutionary changes to the field of vision, achieving significant accomplishments on the experimental side. However, their theoretical capabilities, particularly in terms of generalization when trained to overfit training data, are still not fully understood. To address this gap, this work delves deeply into the \textit{benign overfitting} perspective of transformers in vision. To this end, we study the optimization of a Transformer composed of a self-attention layer with softmax followed by a fully connected layer under gradient descent on a certain data distribution modal. By developing techniques that address the challenges posed by softmax and the interdependent nature of multiple weights in transformer optimization, we successfully characterized the training dynamics and achieved generalization in post-training. Our results establish a sharp condition that can distinguish between the small test error phase and the large test error regime, based on the signal-to-noise ratio in the data model. The theoretical results are further verified by experimental simulation.

Unveiling the Hidden Structure of Self-Attention via Kernel Principal Component Analysis
The remarkable success of transformers in sequence modeling tasks, spanning various applications in natural language processing and computer vision, is attributed to the critical role of self-attention. Similar to the development of most deep learning models, the construction of these attention mechanisms relies on heuristics and experience. In our work, we derive self-attention from kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) and show that self-attention projects its query vectors onto the principal component axes of its key matrix in a feature space. We then formulate the exact formula for the value matrix in self-attention, theoretically and empirically demonstrating that this value matrix captures the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix of the key vectors in self-attention. Leveraging our kernel PCA framework, we propose Attention with Robust Principal Components (RPC-Attention), a novel class of robust attention that is resilient to data contamination. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of RPC-Attention over softmax attention on the ImageNet-1K object classification, WikiText-103 language modeling, and ADE20K image segmentation task.

Unveiling the Potential of Robustness in Selecting Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimators
The growing demand for personalized decision-making has led to a surge of interest in estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). Various types of CATE estimators have been developed with advancements in machine learning and causal inference. However, selecting the desirable CATE estimator through a conventional model validation procedure remains impractical due to the absence of counterfactual outcomes in observational data. Existing approaches for CATE estimator selection, such as plug-in and pseudo-outcome metrics, face two challenges. First, they must determine the metric form and the underlying machine learning models for fitting nuisance parameters (e.g., outcome function, propensity function, and plug-in learner). Second, they lack a specific focus on selecting a robust CATE estimator. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Distributionally Robust Metric (DRM) for CATE estimator selection. The proposed DRM is nuisance-free, eliminating the need to fit models for nuisance parameters, and it effectively prioritizes the selection of a distributionally robust CATE estimator. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the DRM method in selecting a CATE estimator that is robust to the uncertainty of counterfactual distribution incurred by covariate shift and unmeasured confounders.

Unveiling the Power of Diffusion Features For Personalized Segmentation and Retrieval
Personalized retrieval and segmentation aim to locate specific instances within a dataset based on an input image and a short description of the reference instance. While supervised methods are effective, they require extensive labeled data for training. Recently, self-supervised foundation models have been introduced to these tasks showing comparable results to supervised methods. However, a significant flaw in these models is evident: they struggle to locate a desired instance when other instances within the same class are presented. In this paper, we explore text-to-image diffusion models for these tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called PDM for Personalized Features Diffusion Matching, that leverages intermediate features for personalization tasks without any additional training. PDM demonstrates superior performance on popular retrieval and segmentation benchmarks, outperforming even supervised methods. We also highlight notable shortcomings in current instance and segmentation benchmarks and propose new benchmarks for these tasks.

UPS: Unified Projection Sharing for Lightweight Single-Image Super-resolution and Beyond
To date, transformer-based frameworks have demonstrated impressive results in single-image super-resolution (SISR). However, under practical lightweight scenarios, the complex interaction of deep image feature extraction and similarity modeling limits the performance of these methods, since they require simultaneous layer-specific optimization of both two tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel Unified Projection Sharing algorithm(UPS) to decouple the feature extraction and similarity modeling, achieving notable performance. To do this, we establish a unified projection space defined by a learnable projection matrix, for similarity calculation across all self-attention layers. As a result, deep image feature extraction remains a per-layer optimization manner, while similarity modeling is carried out by projecting these image features onto the shared projection space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed UPS achieves state-of-the-art performance relative to leading lightweight SISR methods, as verified by various popular benchmarks. Moreover, our unified optimized projection space exhibits encouraging robustness performance for unseen data (degraded and depth images). Lastly, lightweight UPS also shows promising results for more image restoration tasks.

UQ-Guided Hyperparameter Optimization for Iterative Learners
Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) plays a pivotal role in unleashing the potential of iterative machine learning models. This paper addresses a crucial aspect that has largely been overlooked in HPO: the impact of uncertainty in ML model training. The paper introduces the concept of uncertainty-aware HPO and presents a novel approach called the UQ-guided scheme for quantifying uncertainty. This scheme offers a principled and versatile method to empower HPO techniques in handling model uncertainty during their exploration of the candidate space.By constructing a probabilistic model and implementing probability-driven candidate selection and budget allocation, this approach enhances the quality of the resulting model hyperparameters. It achieves a notable performance improvement of over 50\% in terms of accuracy regret and exploration time.

User-Creator Feature Dynamics in Recommender Systems with Dual Influence
Recommender systems are designed to serve the dual purpose of presenting relevant content to users, while also helping content creators reach their target audience. The dual nature of these systems naturally influences both users and creators: a user's preference can be altered by the items they are recommended, while creators may be incentivized to alter their content such that it is recommended more frequently.We define a model, called user-creator feature dynamics, to capture the dual influences of recommender systems.We prove that a recommender system with dual influence is guaranteed to polarize, causing diversity loss in the system.We then investigate, both theoretically and experimentally, approaches for promoting diversity in recommender systems as a means of mitigating polarization.Unexpectedly, we find that common diversity-promoting approaches do not work in the presence of dual influence, while relevancy-optimizing methods like top-$k$ recommendation can prevent polarization and improve diversity of the system.

User-item fairness tradeoffs in recommendations
In the basic recommendation paradigm, the most relevant item is recommended to each user. This may result in some items receiving lower exposure than they "should"; to counter this, several algorithmic approaches have been developed to ensure item fairness. These approaches necessarily degrade recommendations for some users to improve outcomes for items, leading to user fairness concerns. In turn, a recent line of work has focused on developing algorithms for multi-sided fairness, to jointly optimize user fairness, item fairness, and overall recommendation quality. This induces the question: what is the tradeoff between these objectives, and what are the characteristics of (multi-objective) optimal solutions? Theoretically, we develop a model of recommendations with user, item, and overall utility objectives and characterize the solutions of fairness-constrained optimization. We identify two phenomena: (a) when user preferences are diverse, there is "free" item and user fairness; and (b) users whose preferences are misestimated can be especially disadvantaged by item fairness constraints. Empirically, we build a recommendation system for preprints on arXiv and implement our framework, measuring the phenomena in practice and showing how these phenomena inform the design of markets with recommendation systems-intermediated matching.

Using Noise to Infer Aspects of Simplicity Without Learning
Noise in data significantly influences decision-making in the data science process. In fact, it has been shown that noise in data generation processes motivates practitioners to choose simpler hypothesis spaces. However, an open question still remains: what is the degree of model simplification we can expect under different noise levels? In this work, we address this question by investigating the relationship between the amount of noise and model simplicity across various hypothesis spaces, focusing on decision trees and linear models. We formally show that noise acts as an implicit regularizer for different noise models. Furthermore, we prove that Rashomon sets (sets of near-optimal models) constructed with noisy data tend to contain simpler models than corresponding Rashomon sets with non-noisy data. Additionally, we show that noise expands the set of ``good'' features, and increases the set of models that use at least one good feature. Our work offers theoretical guarantees and practical insights for both practitioners and policymakers on whether simple-yet-accurate machine learning models are likely to exist, based on knowledge of noise levels in the data generation process.

Using Surrogates in Covariate-adjusted Response-adaptive Randomization Experiments with Delayed Outcomes
Covariate-adjusted response-adaptive randomization (CARA) designs are gaining increasing attention. These designs combine the advantages of randomized experiments with the ability to adaptively revise treatment allocations based on data collected across multiple stages, enhancing estimation efficiency. Yet, CARA designs often assume that primary outcomes are immediately observable, which is not the case in many clinical scenarios where there is a delay in observing primary outcomes. This assumption can lead to significant missingness and inefficient estimation of treatment effects. To tackle this practical challenge, we propose a CARA experimental strategy integrating delayed primary outcomes with immediately observed surrogate outcomes. Surrogate outcomes are intermediate clinical outcomes that are predictive or correlated with the primary outcome of interest. Our design goal is to improve the estimation efficiency of the average treatment effect (ATE) of the primary outcome utilizing surrogate outcomes. From a methodological perspective, our approach offers two benefits: First, we accommodate arm and covariates-dependent delay mechanisms without imposing any parametric modeling assumptions on the distribution of outcomes. Second, when primary outcomes are not fully observed, surrogate outcomes can guide the adaptive treatment allocation rule. From a theoretical standpoint, we prove the semiparametric efficiency bound of estimating ATE under delayed primary outcomes while incorporating surrogate outcomes. We show that the ATE estimator under our proposed design strategy attains this semiparametric efficiency bound and achieves asymptotic normality. Through theoretical investigations and a synthetic HIV study, we show that our design is more efficient than the design without incorporating any surrogate information.

Utilizing Human Behavior Modeling to Manipulate Explanations in AI-Assisted Decision Making: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Recent advances in AI models have increased the integration of AI-based decision aids into the human decision making process. To fully unlock the potential of AI-assisted decision making, researchers have worked on the computational modeling of how humans incorporate AI recommendations into their final decisions, and how to utilize these models to improve human-AI team performance. Currently, due to the ``black-box'' nature of AI models, the incorporation of explanations in AI-assisted decision making is becoming more common to help humans better rely on AI recommendations. In this work, we explore whether we can quantitatively model how humans integrate both AI recommendations and explanations into their decision process, and whether this quantitative understanding of human behavior from the learned model can be utilized to manipulate AI explanations, thereby nudging individuals towards making targeted decisions. Our extensive human experiments across various tasks demonstrate that  human behavior can be easily influenced by these manipulated explanations towards targeted outcomes, regardless of the intent being adversarial or benign. Furthermore, individuals often fail to detect any anomalies in these  explanations, despite their behavior being affected by them.

Utilizing Image Transforms and Diffusion Models for Generative Modeling of Short and Long Time Series
Lately, there has been a surge in interest surrounding generative modeling of time series data. Most existing approaches are designed either to process short sequences or to handle long-range sequences. This dichotomy can be attributed to gradient issues with recurrent networks, computational costs associated with transformers, and limited expressiveness of state space models. Towards a unified generative model for varying-length time series, we propose in this work to transform sequences into images. By employing invertible transforms such as the delay embedding and the short-time Fourier transform, we unlock three main advantages: i) We can exploit advanced diffusion vision models; ii) We can remarkably process short- and long-range inputs within the same framework; and iii) We can harness recent and established tools proposed in the time series to image literature. We validate the effectiveness of our method through a comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks, including unconditional generation, interpolation, and extrapolation. We show that our approach achieves consistently state-of-the-art results against strong baselines. In the unconditional generation tasks, we show remarkable mean improvements of $49.92$% and $132.61$% in the short discriminative and (ultra-)long classification scores, respectively.

UV-free Texture Generation with Denoising and Heat Diffusion
Seams, distortions, wasted uv space, vertex-duplication, and varying resolution over the surface are the most prominent issues of the standard uv-based texturing of meshes. These issues are particularly acute when automatic uv unwrapping techniques are used. For this reason, instead of generating textures in automatically generated uv planes like most state-of-the-art methods, we propose to represent textures as coloured point-clouds whose colours are generated by a denoising diffusion probabilistic model constrained to operate on the surface of 3D objects. Our sampling and resolution agnostic generative model heavily relies on heat diffusion over the surface of the meshes for spatial communication between points. To enable processing of arbitrarily sampled point-cloud textures and ensure long-distance texture consistency we introduce a fast re-sampling of the mesh spectral properties used during the heat diffusion and introduce a novel heat-diffusion-based self-attention mechanism.

Value Imprint: A Technique for Auditing the Human Values Embedded in RLHF Datasets
LLMs are increasingly being fine-tuned using RLHF datasets to align them with human preferences and values. However, little research has investigated which specific human values are being operationalized through these datasets. In this paper, we introduce an approach for auditing RLHF datasets to examine the human values and ethical paradigms embedded within them. Our approach involves two phases. During the first phase, we developed a taxonomy of human values through a systematic review of prior works from philosophy, axiology, and ethics and then used this taxonomy to manually annotate a section of the RLHF preferences to gain foundational insight into the kinds of human values and ethical paradigms embedded within the RLHF dataset. During the second phase, we employed the labels generated from the first phase as ground truth labels to train transformer-based models and, using that approach, conducted an automated human values audit of more than 100K RLHF preferences that we contribute via this study. Overall, through these approaches, we discovered the most dominant human values and ethical orientations within the RLHF preference dataset. These findings have significant implications for developing LLMs and AI systems that align with societal values and norms.

Variance estimation for compound decisions
The normal means model is often studied under the assumption of a known variance. However, ignorance of the variance is a frequent issue in applications and basic theoretical questions still remain open in this setting. This article establishes that the sharp minimax rate of variance estimation in square error is $(\frac{\log\log n}{\log n})^2$ under arguably the most mild assumption imposed for identifiability: bounded means. The rate-optimal estimator proposed in this article achieves the optimal rate by estimating $O\left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right)$ cumulants and leveraging a variational representation of the noise variance in terms of the cumulants of the data distribution. The minimax lower bound involves a moment matching construction.

Variational Distillation of Diffusion Policies into Mixture of Experts
This work introduces Variational Diffusion Distillation (VDD), a novel method that distills denoising diffusion policies into Mixtures of Experts (MoE) through variational inference. Diffusion Models are the current state-of-the-art in generative modeling due to their exceptional ability to accurately learn and represent complex, multi-modal distributions. This ability allows Diffusion Models to replicate the inherent diversity in human behavior, making them the preferred models in behavior learning such as Learning from Human Demonstrations (LfD).However, diffusion models come with some drawbacks, including the intractability of likelihoods %a lack of interpretability, and long inference times due to their iterative sampling process. The inference times, in particular, pose a significant challenge to real-time applications such as robot control.In contrast, MoEs effectively address the aforementioned issues while retaining the ability to represent complex distributions but are notoriously difficult to train.VDD is the first method that distills pre-trained diffusion models into MoE models, and hence, combines the expressiveness of Diffusion Models with the benefits of Mixture Models.Specifically, VDD leverages a decompositional upper bound of the variational objective that allows the training of each expert separately, resulting in a robust optimization scheme for MoEs.VDD demonstrates across nine complex behavior learning tasks, that it is able to: i) accurately distill complex distributions learned by the diffusion model, ii) outperform existing state-of-the-art distillation methods, and iii) surpass conventional methods for training MoE.

VCR-GauS: View Consistent Depth-Normal Regularizer for Gaussian Surface Reconstruction
Although 3D Gaussian Splatting has been widely studied because of its realistic and efficient novel-view synthesis, it is still challenging to extract a high-quality surface from the point-based representation. Previous works improve the surface by incorporating geometric priors from the off-the-shelf normal estimator. However, there are two main limitations: 1) Supervising normal rendered from 3D Gaussians updates only the rotation parameter while neglecting other geometric parameters; 2) The inconsistency of predicted normal maps across multiple views may lead to severe reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we propose a Depth-Normal regularizer that directly couples normal with other geometric parameters, leading to full updates of the geometric parameters from normal regularization. We further propose a confidence term to mitigate inconsistencies of normal predictions across multiple views. Moreover, we also introduce a densification and splitting strategy to regularize the size and distribution of 3D Gaussians for more accurate surface modeling. Compared with Gaussian-based baselines, experiments show that our approach obtains better reconstruction quality and maintains competitive appearance quality at faster training speed and 100+ FPS rendering. Our code will be made open-source upon paper acceptance.

Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction
Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular uncertainty quantification method that provides distribution-free, statistically valid prediction sets, assuming that training and test data are exchangeable. In such a case, CP's prediction sets are guaranteed to cover the (unknown) true test output with a user-specified probability. Nevertheless, this guarantee is violated when the data is subjected to adversarial attacks, which often result in a significant loss of coverage. Recently, several approaches have been put forward to recover CP guarantees in this setting. These approaches leverage variations of randomised smoothing to produce conservative sets which account for the effect of the adversarial perturbations. They are, however, limited in that they only support $\ell^2$-bounded perturbations and classification tasks. This paper introduces VRCP (Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction), a new framework that leverages recent neural network verification methods to recover coverage guarantees under adversarial attacks. Our VRCP method is the first to support perturbations bounded by arbitrary norms including $\ell^1$, $\ell^2$, and $\ell^\infty$, as well as regression tasks. We evaluate and compare our approach on image classification tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet) and regression tasks for deep reinforcement learning environments. In every case, VRCP achieves above nominal coverage and yields significantly more efficient and informative prediction regions than the SotA.

VERIFIED: A Video Corpus Moment Retrieval Benchmark for Fine-Grained Video Understanding
Existing Video Corpus Moment Retrieval (VCMR) is limited to coarse-grained understanding that hinders precise video moment localization when given fine-grained queries. In this paper, we propose a more challenging fine-grained VCMR benchmark requiring methods to localize the best-matched moment from the corpus with other partially matched candidates. To improve the dataset construction efficiency and guarantee high-quality data annotations, we propose VERIFIED, an automatic \underline{V}id\underline{E}o-text annotation pipeline to generate captions with \underline{R}el\underline{I}able \underline{FI}n\underline{E}-grained statics and \underline{D}ynamics. Specifically, we resort to large language models (LLM) and large multimodal models (LMM) with our proposed Statics and Dynamics Enhanced Captioning modules to generate diverse fine-grained captions for each video. To filter out the inaccurate annotations caused by the LLM hallucination, we propose a Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator where we fine-tune a video foundation model with disturbed hard-negatives augmented contrastive and matching losses. With VERIFIED, we construct a more challenging fine-grained VCMR benchmark containing Charades-FIG, DiDeMo-FIG, and ActivityNet-FIG which demonstrate a high level of annotation quality. We evaluate several state-of-the-art VCMR models on the proposed dataset, revealing that there is still significant scope for fine-grained video understanding in VCMR.

VHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Vision Language Models
Current benchmarks for assessing vision-language models (VLMs) often focus on their perception or problem-solving capabilities and neglect other equally critical aspects such as fairness, unbiasedness, or toxicity. Furthermore, they differ in their evaluation procedures and the scope of the evaluation, making it difficult to compare models. To address these issues, we extend the HELM framework to VLMs to present the Holistic Evaluation of Vision Language Models (VHELM). VHELM aggregates various benchmark datasets and maps the scenarios to one or more of the 8 aspects: unbiasedness, fairness, knowledge, multilinguality, reasoning, robustness, toxicity mitigation, and perception. In doing so, we produce a comprehensive, multi-dimensional view of the capabilities of the VLMs across these important factors. In addition, we standardize the standard inference parameters, methods of prompting, and evaluation metrics to enable fair comparisons between models. Our framework is designed to be lightweight and automatic so that evaluation runs are cheap and fast. Our initial run evaluates 18 VLMs on 19 datasets to provide a holistic snapshot of the models. We uncover new key findings, such as the observation that no single model excels across all aspects (as of the time of writing). For transparency, we release the raw model generations and complete results on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/vhelm/v2.0.0. VHELM is meant to be a living benchmark, and we hope to continue adding new scenarios and models over time.

Video Diffusion Models are Training-free Motion Interpreter and Controller
Video generation primarily aims to model authentic and customized motion across frames, making understanding and controlling the motion a crucial topic. Most diffusion-based studies on video motion focus on motion customization with training-based paradigms, which, however, demands substantial training resources and necessitates retraining for diverse models. Crucially, these approaches do not explore how video diffusion models encode cross-frame motion information in their features, lacking interpretability and transparency in their effectiveness. To answer this question, this paper introduces a novel perspective to understand, localize, and manipulate motion-aware features in video diffusion models. Through analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), our work discloses that robust motion-aware feature already exists in video diffusion models. We present a new MOtion FeaTure (MOFT) by eliminating content correlation information and filtering motion channels. MOFT provides a distinct set of benefits, including the ability to encode comprehensive motion information with clear interpretability, extraction without the need for training, and generalizability across diverse architectures. Leveraging MOFT, we propose a novel training-free video motion control framework. Our method demonstrates competitive performance in generating natural and faithful motion, providing architecture-agnostic insights and applicability in a variety of downstream tasks.

VideoGUI: A Benchmark for GUI Automation from Instructional Videos
Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation holds significant promise for enhancing human productivity by assisting with computer tasks. Existing task formulations primarily focus on simple tasks that can be specified by a single, language-only instruction, such as \``Insert a new slide.'' However, the derived methods often struggle with complex, visually-intensive software tasks in the real world, such as ``recreating a specific animation effect shown in a video.'' The challenges include visual perception, lengthy procedural planning, and executing multiple actions. Recognizing that humans frequently rely on instructional videos to master complex skills, we introduce \textbf{\our}, a novel multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate GUI assistants across multiple dimensions of advanced GUI tasks. Sourced from high-quality web instructional videos, \our focuses on advanced tasks involving professional and novel software (\eg Adobe Photoshop or Stable Diffusion WebUI) and complex activities (\eg video editing). Moreover, \our evaluates GUI assistants through a \textit{hierarchical} process, allowing for identification of the specific levels at which they may fail: \textbf{($i$) high-level planning:} reconstruct procedural subtasks from visual conditions without language descriptions; \textbf{($ii$) middle-level planning:} generate sequences of precise action narrations based on visual state (\ie screenshot) and goals; % transitions \textbf{($iii$) atomic action execution:} perform specific actions such as accurately clicking designated elements. For each level, we design evaluation metrics across individual dimensions to provide clear signals, such as individual performance in clicking, dragging, typing, and scrolling for atomic action execution. We evaluate representative large multimodal models on \our, revealing each model's capabilities on these different levels. We observe that the current best model GPT-4o, while proficient at planning from textual queries, still struggles with reversal planning from visual previews and execute certain actions such as dragging. These gaps show the direction for developing stronger models or agent systems for GUI automation from instructional videos.

VidMan: Exploiting Intrinsic Dynamics from Video Diffusion Model for Effective Robot Manipulation
Recent advancements utilizing large-scale video data for learning video generation models demonstrate significant potential in understanding complex physical dynamics. It suggests the feasibility of leveraging diverse robot trajectory data to develop a unified, dynamics-aware model to enhance robot manipulation. However, given the relatively small amount of available robot data, directly fitting data without considering the relationship between visual observations and actions could lead to suboptimal data utilization. To this end, we propose VidMan (Video Diffusion for Robot Manipulation), a novel framework that employs a two-stage training mechanism inspired by dual-process theory from neuroscience to enhance stability and improve data utilization efficiency. Specifically, in the first stage, VidMan is pre-trained on the Open X-Embodiment dataset (OXE) for predicting future visual trajectories in a video denoising diffusion manner, enabling the model to develop a long horizontal awareness of the environment's dynamics. In the second stage, a flexible yet effective layer-wise cross-attention adapter is introduced to transform VidMan into an efficient inverse dynamics model that predicts action modulated by the intrinsic dynamics knowledge via parameter sharing. Our VidMan framework outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models on the RLBench benchmark, achieving a 57\% and 30\% relative improvement under 10-shot and 100-shot demonstration settings, respectively, and demonstrates over 9\% precision gains on the OXE small-scale dataset. These results provide compelling evidence that world models can significantly enhance the precision of robot action prediction.

Virtual Scanning: Unsupervised Non-line-of-sight Imaging from Irregularly Undersampled Transients
Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging allows for the visualization of hidden scenes around corners through active sensing.Most previous methods for NLOS reconstruction require dense transients acquired through regular scans over a large relay surface, which limits their applicability in realistic scenarios with irregular relay surfaces.In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning-based framework for NLOS imaging from irregularly undersampled transients (IUT).Our method learns implicit priors from noisy undersampled transients without requiring paired data, which is difficult and expensive to acquire and align. To overcome the ambiguity of measurement consistency constraint in inferring the latent volume, we design a virtual scanning process that enables the network to learn within both range and null spaces for high-quality reconstruction.We devise a physics-guided SURE-based denoiser to enhance robustness to ubiquitous noise in the by-nature low-photon imaging condition. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data validate the performance and generalization of our method.Compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, our method achieves higher fidelity, greater robustness, and remarkably faster inference times by orders of magnitude.

Vision Model Pre-training on Interleaved Image-Text Data via Latent Compression Learning
Recently, vision model pre-training has evolved from relying on manually annotated datasets to leveraging large-scale, web-crawled image-text data. Despite these advances, there is no pre-training method that effectively exploits the interleaved image-text data, which is very prevalent on the Internet. Inspired by the recent success of compression learning in natural language processing, we propose a novel vision model pre-training method called Latent Compression Learning (LCL) for interleaved image-text data. This method performs latent compression learning by maximizing the mutual information between the inputs and outputs of a causal attention model. The training objective can be decomposed into two basic tasks: 1) contrastive learning between visual representation and preceding context, and 2) generating subsequent text based on visual representation. Our experiments demonstrate that our method not only matches the performance of CLIP on paired pre-training datasets (e.g., LAION), but can also leverage interleaved pre-training data (e.g., MMC4) to learn robust visual representations from scratch, showcasing the potential of vision model pre-training with interleaved image-text data.

Vision Transformer Neural Architecture Search for Out-of-Distribution Generalization: Benchmark and Insights
While Vision Transformer (ViT) have achieved success across various machine learning tasks, deploying them in real-world scenarios faces a critical challenge: generalizing under Out-of-Distribution (OoD) shifts. A crucial research gap remains in understanding how to design ViT architectures – both manually and automatically – to excel in OoD generalization. To address this gap, we introduce OoD-ViT-NAS, the first systematic benchmark for ViT Neural Architecture Search (NAS) focused on OoD generalization. This comprehensive benchmark includes 3,000 ViT architectures of varying model computational budgets evaluated on common large-scale OoD datasets. With this comprehensive benchmark at hand, we analyze the factors that contribute to the OoD generalization of ViT architecture. Our analysis uncovers several key insights. Firstly, we show that ViT architecture designs have a considerable impact on OoD generalization. Secondly, we observe that In-Distribution (ID) accuracy might not be a very good indicator of OoD accuracy. This underscores the risk that ViT architectures optimized for ID accuracy might not perform well under OoD shifts. Thirdly, we conduct the first study to explore NAS for ViT’s OoD robustness. Specifically, we study 9 Training-free NAS for their OoD generalization performance on our benchmark. We observe that existing Training-free NAS are largely ineffective in predicting OoD accuracy despite their effectiveness at predicting ID accuracy. Moreover, simple proxies like #Param or #Flop surprisingly outperform more complex Training-free NAS in predicting ViTs OoD accuracy. Finally, we study how ViT architectural attributes impact OoD generalization. We discover that increasing embedding dimensions of a ViT architecture generally can improve the OoD generalization. We show that ViT architectures in our benchmark exhibit a wide range of OoD accuracy, with up to 11.85% for some OoD shift, prompting the importance to study ViT architecture design for OoD. We firmly believe that our OoD-ViT-NAS benchmark and our analysis can catalyze and streamline important research on understanding how ViT architecture designs influence OoD generalization. Our OoD-NAS-ViT benchmark, code and additional experiments are in Appx.

VisMin: Visual Minimal-Change Understanding
Fine-grained understanding of objects, attributes, and relationships between objects is crucial for visual-language models (VLMs). To evaluate VLMs' fine-grained understanding, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating VLMs' capability to distinguish between two very similar captions given an image. In this paper, our focus is on evaluating VLMs' capability to distinguish between two very similar images given a caption. To this end, we introduce a new, challenging benchmark termed Visual Minimal-Change Understanding (VisMin), which requires models to predict the correct image-caption match given two images and two captions. Importantly, the image pair (as well as the caption pair) contains minimal changes, i.e., between the two images (as well as between the two captions), only one aspect changes at a time from among the following possible types of changes: object, attribute, count, and spatial relation. These four types of minimal changes are specifically designed to test the models' understanding of objects, attributes of objects (such as color, material, shape), counts of objects, and spatial relationships between objects. To curate our benchmark, we built an automatic pipeline using large language models and diffusion models, followed by a rigorous 4-step verification process by human annotators. Empirical experiments reveal that current VLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in understanding spatial relationships and counting abilities. Furthermore, leveraging the automated nature of our data creation process, we generate a large-scale training dataset, which we use to finetune CLIP (a foundational VLM) and Idefics2 (a multimodal large language model). Our findings show that both these models benefit significantly from fine-tuning on this data, as evident by marked improvements in fine-grained understanding across a wide range of benchmarks. Additionally, such fine-tuning improves CLIP's general image-text alignment capabilities too. All resources including the benchmark, the training data, and the finetuned model checkpoints will be released.

Visual Autoregressive Modeling: Scalable Image Generation via Next-Scale Prediction
We present Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR), a new generation paradigm that redefines the autoregressive learning on images as coarse-to-fine "next-scale prediction" or "next-resolution prediction", diverging from the standard raster-scan "next-token prediction". This simple, intuitive methodology allows autoregressive (AR) transformers to learn visual distributions fast and generalize well: VAR, for the first time, makes GPT-style AR models surpass diffusion transformers in image generation. On ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VAR significantly improve AR baseline by improving Frechet inception distance (FID) from 18.65 to 1.73, inception score (IS) from 80.4 to 350.2, with around 20x faster inference speed. It is also empirically verified that VAR outperforms the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in multiple dimensions including image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability. Scaling up VAR models exhibits clear power-law scaling laws similar to those observed in LLMs, with linear correlation coefficients near -0.998 as solid evidence. VAR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability in downstream tasks including image in-painting, out-painting, and editing. These results suggest VAR has initially emulated the two important properties of LLMs: Scaling Laws and zero-shot task generalization. We have released all models and codes to promote the exploration of AR/VAR models for visual generation and unified learning.

Visual Decoding and Reconstruction via EEG Embeddings with Guided Diffusion
How to decode human vision through neural signals has attracted a long-standing interest in neuroscience and machine learning. Modern contrastive learning and generative models improved the performance of visual decoding and reconstruction based on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). However, the high cost and low temporal resolution of fMRI limit their applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), prompting a high need for visual decoding based on electroencephalography (EEG). In this study, we present an end-to-end EEG-based visual reconstruction zero-shot framework, consisting of a tailored brain encoder, called the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM), which projects neural signals from different sources into the shared subspace as the clip embedding, and a two-stage EEG-to-image generation strategy. In stage one, EEG is embedded to align the high-level clip embedding, and then prior diffusion model refines EEG embedding into image priors. A blurry image also decoded from EEG for maintaining the low-level feature. In stage two, we input both the high-level clip embedding and the blurry image to a pre-trained diffusion model. Furthermore, we analyzed the impacts of different time windows and brain regions on decoding and reconstruction. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated in the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data modality. The experimental results indicate that our EEG-based visual zero-shot framework achieves SOTA performance in classification, retrieval and reconstruction, highlighting the portability, low cost, and high temporal resolution of EEG, enabling a wide range of BCI applications. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Visual_Reconstruction-AC56.

Visual Fourier Prompt Tuning
With the scale of vision Transformer-based models continuing to grow, finetuning these large-scale pretrained models for new tasks has become increasingly parameter-intensive. Visual prompt tuning is introduced as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method to this trend. Despite its successes, a notable research challenge persists within almost all PEFT approaches: significant performance degradation is observed when there is a substantial disparity between the datasets applied in pretraining and finetuning phases. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from human visual cognition, and propose the Visual Fourier Prompt Tuning (VFPT) method as a general and effective solution for adapting large-scale transformer-based models. Our approach innovatively incorporates the Fast Fourier Transform into prompt embeddings and harmoniously considers both spatial and frequency domain information. Apart from its inherent simplicity and intuitiveness, VFPT exhibits superior performance across all datasets, offering a general solution to dataset challenges, irrespective of data disparities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks, with low parameter usage (e.g., 0.57% of model parameters on VTAB-1k) and notable performance enhancements (e.g., 73.20% of mean accuracy on VTAB-1k).

Visual Pinwheel Center Act as Geometric Saliency Detector
During natural evolution, the primary visual cortex (V1) of lower mammals typically forms salt-and-pepper clusters, while higher mammals and primates develop pinwheel structures with distinct topological properties. Despite the general belief that V1 neurons primarily serve as edge detectors, the functional advantages of pinwheel structures over salt-and-pepper configurations are not well recognized. To this end, we propose a two-dimensional self-evolving spiking neural network that integrates Hebbian-like plasticity and empirical morphological data. Through extensive exposure to image data, our network evolves from salt-and-pepper clusters to pinwheel structures, with neurons becoming localized bandpass filters responsive to various orientations. This transformation is accompanied by an increase in visual field overlap. Our findings indicate that neurons in pinwheel centers (PCs) respond more effectively to complex spatial textures in natural images, exhibiting stronger and quicker reactions than those in salt-and-pepper organizations. PCs act as first-order stage processors with heightened sensitivity and reduced latency to intricate contours, while adjacent iso-orientation domains serve as second-order stage processors that refine edge representations for clearer perception. This study provides initial theoretical evidence that pinwheel structures function as crucial detectors of spatial contour saliency in the visual cortex.

Visual Prompt Tuning in Null Space for Continual Learning
Existing prompt-tuning methods have demonstrated impressive performances in continual learning (CL), by selecting and updating relevant prompts in the vision-transformer models. On the contrary, this paper aims to learn each task by tuning the prompts in the direction orthogonal to the subspace spanned by previous tasks' features, so as to ensure no interference on tasks that have been learned to overcome catastrophic forgetting in CL. However, different from the orthogonal projection in the traditional CNN architecture, the prompt gradient orthogonal projection in the ViT architecture shows completely different and greater challenges, i.e., 1) the high-order and non-linear self-attention operation; 2) the drift of prompt distribution brought by the LayerNorm in the transformer block. Theoretically, we have finally deduced two consistency conditions to achieve the prompt gradient orthogonal projection, which provide a theoretical guarantee of eliminating interference on previously learned knowledge via the self-attention mechanism in visual prompt tuning. In practice, an effective null-space-based approximation solution has been proposed to implement the prompt gradient orthogonal projection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of anti-forgetting on four class-incremental benchmarks with diverse pre-trained baseline models, and our approach achieves superior performances to state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available in the supplemental material.

Warm-starting Push-Relabel
Push-Relabel is one of the most celebrated network flow algorithms. Maintaining a pre-flow that saturates a cut, it enjoys better theoretical and empirical running time than other flow algorithms, such as Ford-Fulkerson. In practice, Push-Relabel is even faster than what theoretical guarantees can promise, in part because of the use of good heuristics for seeding and updating the iterative algorithm. However, it remains unclear how to run Push-Relabel on an arbitrary initialization that is not necessarily a pre-flow or cut-saturating. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for warm-starting Push-Relabel with a predicted flow, where our learning-augmented version benefits from fast running time when the predicted flow is close to an optimal flow, while maintaining robust worst-case guarantees. Interestingly, our algorithm uses the gap relabeling heuristic, which has long been employed in practice, even though prior to our work there was no rigorous theoretical justification for why it can lead to run-time improvements. We then show our algorithmic framework works well in practice, as our warm-start version of Push-Relabel improves over the cold-start version by a larger and larger percentage as the size of the image increases.

Warped Diffusion: Solving Video Inverse Problems with Image Diffusion Models
Using image models naively for solving inverse video problems often suffers from flickering, texture-sticking, and temporal inconsistency in generated videos. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we view frames as continuous functions in the 2D space, and videos as a sequence of continuous warping transformations between different frames. This perspective allows us to train function space diffusion models only on *images* and utilize them to solve temporally correlated inverse problems. The function space diffusion models need to be equivariant to the underlying spatial transformations. To ensure temporal consistency, we introduce a simple post-hoc test-time guidance towards (self)-equivariant solutions. Our method allows us to deploy state-of-the-art latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion XL to solve video inverse problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for video inpainting and $8\times$ video super-resolution, outperforming existing techniques based on noise transformations. We provide generated video results in the following (anonymized) URL: https://anonneurips2024.github.io/

Wasserstein convergence of Cech persistence diagrams for samplings of submanifolds
Cech Persistence diagrams (PDs) are topological descriptors routinely used to capture the geometry of complex datasets. They are commonly compared using the Wasserstein distances $\mathrm{OT}_p$; however, the extent to which PDs are stable with respect to these metrics remains poorly understood. We partially close this gap by focusing on the case where datasets are sampled on an $m$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Under this manifold hypothesis, we show that convergence with respect to the $\mathrm{OT}_p$ metric happens exactly when $p>m$. We also provide improvements upon the bottleneck stability theorem in this case and prove new laws of large numbers for the total $\alpha$-persistence of PDs. Finally, we show how these theoretical findings shed new light on the behavior of the feature maps on the space of PDs that are used in ML-oriented applications of Topological Data Analysis.

Wasserstein Distance Rivals Kullback-Leibler Divergence for Knowledge Distillation
Since pioneering work of Hinton et al., knowledge distillation based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Div) has been  predominant, and recently its variants have achieved compelling performance.  However, KL-Div  only compares probabilities of the corresponding category between the teacher and student while lacking a mechanism for cross-category comparison.  Besides, KL-Div is problematic when applied to intermediate layers, as it cannot handle non-overlapping distributions and is unaware of geometry of the underlying manifold. To address these downsides, we propose a methodology of Wasserstein Distance (WD) based knowledge distillation. Specifically, we propose  a logit distillation method called WKD-L based on discrete WD, which performs cross-category comparison of  probabilities and thus can explicitly leverage  rich interrelations among categories.  Moreover, we introduce a feature distillation method called WKD-F, which  uses a parametric method for modeling feature distributions and adopts continuous WD  for transferring knowledge from  intermediate layers. Comprehensive evaluations  on image classification and object detection  have shown  (1) for logit distillation WKD-L outperforms very strong KL-Div variants; (2) for feature distillation WKD-F is superior to the KL-Div counterparts and state-of-the-art competitors.

Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization through the Lens of Structural Causal Models and Individual Fairness
In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when considering causal structures and discrete sensitive attributes in learning problems.To address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from the perspectives of causality and individual fairness. We then present the DRO dual formulation as an efficient tool to convert the main problem into a more tractable and computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step in the Min-Max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust learning.

Wasserstein Gradient Boosting: A General Framework with Applications to Posterior Regression
Gradient boosting is a sequential ensemble method that fits a new base learner to the gradient of the remaining loss at each step. We propose a novel family of gradient boosting, Wasserstein gradient boosting, which fits a new base learner to an exactly or approximately available Wasserstein gradient of a loss functional on the space of probability distributions. Wasserstein gradient boosting returns a set of particles that approximates a target probability distribution assigned at each input. In probabilistic prediction, a parametric probability distribution is often specified on the space of output variables, and a point estimate of the output-distribution parameter is produced for each input by a model. Our main application of Wasserstein gradient boosting is a novel distributional estimate of the output-distribution parameter, which approximates the posterior distribution over the output-distribution parameter determined pointwise at each data point. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of the probabilistic prediction by Wasserstein gradient boosting in comparison with various existing methods.

WebUOT-1M: Advancing Deep Underwater Object Tracking with A Million-Scale Benchmark
Underwater object tracking (UOT) is a foundational task for identifying and tracing submerged entities in underwater video sequences. However, current UOT datasets suffer from limitations in scale, diversity of target categories and scenarios covered, hindering the training and evaluation of modern tracking algorithms. To bridge this gap, we take the first step and introduce WebUOT-1M, \ie, the largest public UOT benchmark to date, sourced from complex and realistic underwater environments. It comprises 1.1 million frames across 1,500 video clips filtered from 408 target categories, largely surpassing previous UOT datasets, \eg, UVOT400. Through meticulous manual annotation and verification, we provide high-quality bounding boxes for underwater targets. Additionally, WebUOT-1M includes language prompts for video sequences, expanding its application areas, \eg, underwater vision-language tracking. Most existing trackers are tailored for open-air environments, leading to performance degradation when applied to UOT due to domain gaps. Retraining and fine-tuning these trackers are challenging due to sample imbalances and limited real-world underwater datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel omni-knowledge distillation framework based on WebUOT-1M, incorporating various strategies to guide the learning of the student Transformer. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first to effectively transfer open-air domain knowledge to the UOT model through knowledge distillation, as demonstrated by results on both existing UOT datasets and the newly proposed WebUOT-1M. Furthermore, we comprehensively evaluate WebUOT-1M using 30 deep trackers, showcasing its value as a benchmark for UOT research by presenting new challenges and opportunities for future studies. The complete dataset, codes and tracking results, will be made publicly available at \href{https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking}{\color{magenta}{here}}.

Weight Diffusion for Future: Learn to Generalize in Non-Stationary Environments
Enabling deep models to generalize in non-stationary environments is vital for real-world machine learning, as data distributions are often found to continually change. Recently, evolving domain generalization (EDG) has emerged to tackle the domain generalization in a time-varying system, where the domain gradually evolves over time in an underlying continuous structure. Nevertheless, it typically assumes multiple source domains simultaneously ready. It still remains an open problem to address EDG in the domain-incremental setting, where source domains are non-static and arrive sequentially to mimic the evolution of training domains. To this end, we propose Weight Diffusion (W-Diff), a novel framework that utilizes the conditional diffusion model in the parameter space to learn the evolving pattern of classifiers during the domain-incremental training process. Specifically, the diffusion model is conditioned on the classifier weights of different historical domain (regarded as a reference point) and the prototypes of current domain, to learn the evolution from the reference point to the classifier weights of current domain (regarded as the anchor point). In addition, a domain-shared feature encoder is learned by enforcing prediction consistency among multiple classifiers, so as to mitigate the overfitting problem and restrict the evolving pattern to be reflected in the classifier as much as possible. During inference, we adopt the ensemble manner based on a great number of target domain-customized classifiers, which are cheaply obtained via the conditional diffusion model, for robust prediction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show the superior generalization performance of W-Diff on unseen domains in the future.

Weight for Robustness: A Comprehensive Approach towards Optimal Fault-Tolerant Asynchronous ML
We address the challenges of Byzantine-robust training in asynchronous distributed machine learning systems, aiming to enhance efficiency amid massive parallelization and heterogeneous compute resources. Asynchronous systems, marked by independently operating workers and intermittent updates, uniquely struggle with maintaining integrity against Byzantine failures, which encompass malicious or erroneous actions that disrupt learning. The inherent delays in such settings not only introduce additional bias to the system but also obscure the disruptions caused by Byzantine faults. To tackle these issues, we adapt the Byzantine framework to asynchronous dynamics by introducing a novel weighted robust aggregation framework. This allows for the extension of robust aggregators and a recent meta-aggregator to their weighted versions, mitigating the effects of delayed updates. By further incorporating a recent variance-reduction technique, we achieve an optimal convergence rate for the first time in an asynchronous Byzantine environment. Our methodology is rigorously validated through empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing fault tolerance and optimizing performance in asynchronous ML systems.

What can Foundation Models’ Embeddings do?
Foundation models possess strong capabilities in reasoning and memorizing across modalities. To further unleash the power of foundation models, we present FIND, a generalized interface for aligning foundation models' embeddings with unified image and dataset-level understanding spanning modality and granularity. As shown in Fig.1, a lightweight transformer interface without tuning any foundation model weights is enough for segmentation, grounding, and retrieval in an interleaved manner. The proposed interface has the following favorable attributes: (1) Generalizable. It applies to various tasks spanning retrieval, segmentation, etc., under the same architecture and weights.  (2) Interleavable. With the benefit of multi-task multi-modal training, the proposed interface creates an interleaved shared embedding space. (3) Extendable. The proposed interface is adaptive to new tasks, and new models. In light of the interleaved embedding space, we introduce FIND-Bench, which introduces new training and evaluation annotations to the COCO dataset for interleaved segmentation and retrieval. We are the first work aligning foundations models' embeddings for interleave understanding. Meanwhile, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on FIND-Bench and competitive performance on standard retrieval and segmentation settings.

What does guidance do? A fine-grained analysis in a simple setting
The use of guidance in diffusion models was originally motivated by the fact that the guidance-modified score corresponds to the data density scaled by the conditional likelihood of a label or prompt raised to a power (a tilted distribution). To the contrary, we show that guidance applied even with the *exact score function* does not sample from the intended tilted distribution. We establish a fine-grained characterization of the dynamics of the probability flow ODE in two cases: (1) mixtures of two products of linearly separable, compactly supported distributions and (2) mixtures of two Gaussians. In both cases, a corollary of our characterization is that increasing the guidance parameter leads to sampling towards the edges of the supports of the class-conditional distributions. In addition to verifying these results empirically in synthetic settings, we also show how our theoretical insights can be applied to practice.

What do Graph Neural Networks learn? Insights from Tropical Geometry
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been analyzed from multiple perspectives, including the WL-hierarchy, which exposes limits on their expressivity to distinguish graphs. However, characterizing the class of functions that they learn has remained unresolved. We address this fundamental question for message passing GNNs under ReLU activations, i.e., the de-facto choice for most GNNs.We first show that such GNNs learn tropical rational signomial maps, establishing an equivalence with feedforward networks (FNNs).We then elucidate the role of the choice of aggregation and update functions, and derive the first general upper and lower bounds on the geometric complexity (i.e., the number of linear regions), establishing new results for popular architectures such as GraphSAGE and GIN. We also introduce and theoretically analyze several new architectures to illuminate the relative merits of the feedforward and the message passing layers, and the tradeoffs involving depth and number of trainable parameters.  Finally, we also characterize the decision boundary for node and graph classification tasks.

What Is Missing For Graph Homophily? Disentangling Graph Homophily For Graph Neural Networks
Graph homophily refers to the phenomenon that connected nodes tend to share similar characteristics. Understanding this concept and its related metrics is crucial for designing effective Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The most widely used homophily metrics, such as edge or node homophily, quantify such "similarity" as label consistency across the graph topology. These metrics are believed to be able to reflect the performance of GNNs, especially on node-level tasks. However, many recent studies have empirically demonstrated that the performance of GNNs does not always align with homophily metrics, and how homophily influences GNNs still remains unclear and controversial. Then, a crucial question arises from such controversy: Should we completely discard the conventional definition of graph homophily? In this paper, our answer is NO. We find that the original homophily is still useful, but only provides a partial understanding of the GNNs performance. To give a comprehensive view, we disentangle graph homophily into $3$ different aspects: label, structural, and feature homophily, which corresponds to $3$ basic elements of graph data and our proposed feature homophily can disentangle the influence of node features from label and structural homophily. To investigate their synergy, we propose a Contextual Stochastic Block Model with $3$ types of Homophily (CSBM-3H), where the topology and feature generation are controlled by those $3$ types of homophily. Based on CSBM-3H, we propose a composite metric, named Tri-Hom, which combines all $3$ homophily aspects. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that GNNs performance is indeed strongly correlated with Tri-Hom. Tri-Hom provides a more comprehensive view of homophily and can explain the inconsistency between conventional homophily metrics and GNNs performance. In addition, our experimental results on $31$ real-world datasets also verify that Tri-Hom aligns with GNNs performance significantly better than other $17$ existing metrics that only focus on a single homophily aspect, which confirms the superiority of the disentangled homophily.

What Makes Partial-Label Learning Algorithms Effective?
A partial label (PL) specifies a set of candidate labels for an instance and partial-label learning (PLL) trains multi-class classifiers with PLs.Recently, many methods that incorporate techniques from other domains have shown strong potential.The expectation that stronger techniques would enhance performance has resulted in prominent PLL methods becoming not only highly complicated but also quite different from one another, making it challenging to choose the best direction for future algorithm design.While it is exciting to see higher performance, this leaves open a fundamental question: what makes a PLL method effective?We present a comprehensive empirical analysis of this question and summarize the success of PLL so far into some minimal algorithm design principles.Our findings reveal that high accuracy on benchmark-simulated datasets with PLs can misleadingly amplify the perceived effectiveness of some general techniques, which may improve representation learning but have limited impact on addressing the inherent challenges of PLs. We further identify the common behavior among successful PLL methods as a progressive transition from uniform to one-hot pseudo-labels, highlighting the critical role of mini-batch PL purification in achieving top performance.Based on our findings, we introduce a minimal working algorithm that is surprisingly simple yet effective, and propose an improved strategy to implement the design principles, suggesting a promising direction for improvements in PLL.

What Matters in Graph Class Incremental Learning? An Information Preservation Perspective
Graph class incremental learning (GCIL) requires the model to classify emerging nodes of new classes while remembering old classes. Existing methods are designed to preserve effective information of old models or graph data to alleviate forgetting, but there is no clear theoretical understanding of what matters in information preservation. In this paper, we consider that present practice suffers from high semantic and structural shifts assessed by two devised shift metrics. We provide insights into information preservation in GCIL and find that maintaining graph information can preserve information of old models in theory to calibrate node semantic and graph structure shifts. We correspond graph information into low-frequency local-global parts and high-frequency parts in spatial domain. Based on the analysis, we propose a universal framework, Graph Spatial Information Preservation (GSIP). Specifically, for low-frequency information preservation, the old node representations obtained by inputting replayed nodes into the old model are aligned with the outputs of the node and its neighbors in the new model, then old and new outputs are globally matched after pooling. For high-frequency information preservation, the new node representations are encouraged to imitate the near neighbor pair similarity of old node representations. GSIP achieves a 10% increase in terms of the forgetting metric compared to prior methods on large-scale datasets. Our framework can also seamlessly integrate existing replay designs.

What type of inference is planning?
Multiple types of inference are available for probabilistic graphical models, e.g., marginal, maximum-a-posteriori, and even marginal maximum-a-posteriori. Which one do researchers mean when they talk about "planning as inference"? There is no consistency in the literature, different types are used, and their ability to do planning is further entangled with specific approximations or additional constraints. In this work we use the variational framework to show that all commonly used types of inference correspond to different weightings of the entropy terms in the variational problem, and that planning corresponds exactly to a different set of weights. This means that all the tricks of variational inference are readily applicable to planning. We develop an analogue of loopy belief propagation that allows us to perform approximate planning in factored-state Markov decisions processes without incurring intractability due to the exponentially large state space. The variational perspective shows that the previous types of inference for planning are only adequate in environments with low stochasticity, and allows us to characterize each type by its own merits, disentangling the type of inference from the additional approximations that its practical use requires. We validate these results empirically on synthetic MDPs and tasks posed in the International Planning Competition.

What Variables Affect Out-Of-Distribution Generalization in Pretrained Models?
Embeddings produced by pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used; however, their efficacy for downstream tasks can vary widely. We study the factors influencing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of pre-trained DNN embeddings through the lens of the tunnel effect hypothesis, which suggests deeper DNN layers compress representations and hinder OOD performance. Contrary to earlier work, we find the tunnel effect is not universal. Based on 10,584 linear probes, we study the conditions that mitigate the tunnel effect by varying DNN architecture, training dataset, image resolution, and augmentations. We quantify each variable's impact using a novel SHAP analysis. Our results emphasize the danger of generalizing findings from toy datasets to broader contexts.

When Is Inductive Inference Possible?
Can a physicist make only a finite number of errors in the eternal quest to uncover the law of nature?This millennium-old philosophical problem, known as inductive inference, lies at the heart of epistemology.Despite its significance to understanding human reasoning, a rigorous justification of inductive inference has remained elusive.At a high level, inductive inference asks whether one can make at most finite errors amidst an infinite sequence of observations, when deducing the correct hypothesis from a given hypothesis class.Historically, the only theoretical guarantee has been that if the hypothesis class is countable, inductive inference is possible, as exemplified by Solomonoff induction for learning Turing machines.In this paper, we provide a tight characterization of inductive inference by establishing a novel link to online learning theory.As our main result, we prove that inductive inference is possible if and only if the hypothesis class is a countable union of online learnable classes, potentially with an uncountable size, no matter the observations are adaptively chosen or iid sampled.Moreover, the same condition is also sufficient and necessary in the agnostic setting, where any hypothesis class meeting this criterion enjoys an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for any time step $T$, while others require an arbitrarily slow rate of regret.Our main technical tool is a novel non-uniform online learning framework, which may be of independent interest.Our main technical tool is a novel non-uniform online learning framework, which may be of independent interest.

When is Multicalibration Post-Processing Necessary?
Calibration is a well-studied property of predictors which guarantees meaningful uncertainty estimates. Multicalibration is a related notion --- originating in algorithmic fairness --- which requires predictors to be simultaneously calibrated over a potentially complex and overlapping collection of protected subpopulations (such as groups defined by ethnicity, race, or income). We conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the usefulness of multicalibration post-processing across a broad set of tabular, image, and language datasets for models spanning from simple decision trees to 90 million parameter fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) models which are calibrated out of the box tend to be relatively multicalibrated without any additional post-processing; (2) multicalibration can help inherently uncalibrated models; and (3) traditional calibration measures may sometimes provide multicalibration implicitly. More generally, we also distill many independent observations which may be useful for practical and effective applications of multicalibration post-processing in real-world contexts.

When to Act and When to Ask: Policy Learning With Deferral Under Hidden Confounding
We consider the task of learning how to act in collaboration with a human expert based on observational data. The task is motivated by high-stake scenarios such as healthcare and welfare where algorithmic action recommendations are made to a human expert, opening the option of deferring making a recommendation in cases where the human might act better on their own.    This task is especially challenging when dealing with observational data, as using such data runs the risk of hidden confounders whose existence can lead to biased and harmful policies. However, unlike standard policy learning, the presence of a human expert can mitigate some of these risks. We build on the work of Mozannar and Sontag (2020) on consistent surrogate loss for learning with the option of deferral to an expert, where they solve a cost-sensitive supervised classification problem. Since we are solving a causal problem, where labels don’t exist, we use a causal model to learn costs which are robust to a bounded degree of hidden confounding.    We prove that our approach can take advantage of the strengths of both the model and the expert to obtain a better policy than either. We demonstrate our results by conducting experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic data and show the advantages of our method compared to baselines.

When to Sense and Control? A Time-adaptive Approach for Continuous-Time RL
Reinforcement learning (RL) excels in optimizing policies for discrete-time Markov decision processes (MDP). However, various systems are inherently continuous in time, making discrete-time MDPs an inexact modeling choice. In many applications, such as greenhouse control or medical treatments, each interaction (measurement or switching of action) involves manual intervention and thus is inherently costly. Therefore, we generally prefer a time-adaptive approach with fewer interactions with the system.In this work, we formalize an RL framework, **T**ime-**a**daptive **Co**ntrol \& **S**ensing (**TaCoS**), that tackles this challenge by optimizing over policies that besides control predict the duration of its application. Our formulation results in an extended MDP that any standard RL algorithm can solve.We demonstrate that state-of-the-art RL algorithms trained on TaCoS drastically reduce the interaction amount over their discrete-time counterpart while retaining the same or improved performance, and exhibiting robustness over discretization frequency.Finally, we propose OTaCoS, an efficient model-based algorithm for our setting. We show that OTaCoS enjoys sublinear regret for systems with sufficiently smooth dynamics and empirically results in further sample-efficiency gains.

Where Do Large Learning Rates Lead Us?
It is generally accepted that starting neural networks training with large learning rates (LRs) improves generalization. Following a line of research devoted to understanding this effect, we conduct an empirical study in a controlled setting focusing on two questions: 1) how large an initial LR is required for obtaining optimal quality, and 2) what are the key differences between models trained with different LRs? We discover that only a narrow range of initial LRs slightly above the convergence threshold lead to optimal results after fine-tuning with a small LR or weight averaging. By studying the local geometry of reached minima, we observe that using LRs from this optimal range allows for the optimization to locate a basin that only contains high-quality minima. Additionally, we show that these initial LRs result in a sparse set of learned features, with a clear focus on those most relevant for the task. In contrast, starting training with small LRs leads to unstable minima and attempts to learn all features simultaneously, resulting in poor generalization. Conversely, using initial LRs that are too large fails to detect a basin with good solutions and extract meaningful patterns from the data.

Who Needs Features? On the Surprising Effectiveness of Attention Transfer for Vision Transformers
Conventional wisdom suggests that pre-training Vision Transformers (ViT) improves downstream performance by learning useful representations. Is this actually true? We investigate this question and find that the features and representations learned during pre-training are not essential.  Surprisingly, using only the attention patterns from pre-training (i.e., guiding how information flows between tokens) is sufficient for models to learn high quality features from scratch and achieve comparable downstream performance. We show this by introducing a simple method called attention transfer, where only the attention patterns from a pre-trained teacher ViT are transferred to a student, either by copying or distilling the attention maps. Since attention transfer lets the student learn its own features, ensembling it with a fine-tuned teacher also further improves accuracy on ImageNet. We systematically study various aspects of our findings on the sufficiency of attention maps, including distribution shift settings where they underperform fine-tuning. We hope our exploration provides a better understanding of what pre-training accomplishes and leads to a useful alternative to the standard practice of fine-tuning.

Who’s asking? User personas and the mechanics of latent misalignment
Despite investments in improving model safety, studies show that misaligned capabilities remain latent in safety-tuned models.In this work, we shed light on the mechanics of this phenomenon. First, we show that even when model generations are safe, harmful content can persist in hidden representations and can be extracted by decoding from earlier layers. Then, we show that whether the model divulges such content depends significantly on its perception of who it is talking to, which we refer to as user persona. In fact, we find manipulating user persona to be even more effective for eliciting harmful content than direct attempts to control model refusal. We study both natural language prompting and activation steering as control methods and show that activation steering is significantly more effective at bypassing safety filters. We investigate why certain personas break model safeguards and find that they enable the model to form more charitable interpretations of otherwise dangerous queries. Finally, we show we can predict a persona’s effect on refusal given only the geometry of its steering vector.

Why the Metric Backbone Preserves Community Structure
The metric backbone of a weighted graph is the union of all-pairs shortest paths. It is obtained by removing all edges $(u,v)$ that are not the shortest path between $u$ and $v$. In networks with well-separated communities, the metric backbone tends to preserve many inter-community edges, because these edges serve as bridges connecting two communities, but tends to delete many intra-community edges because the communities are dense. This suggests that the metric backbone would dilute or destroy the community structure of the network. However, this is not borne out by prior empirical work, which instead showed that the metric backbone of real networks preserves the community structure of the original network well. In this work, we analyze the metric backbone of a broad class of weighted random graphs with communities, and we formally prove the robustness of the community structure with respect to the deletion of all the edges that are not in the metric backbone. An empirical comparison of several graph sparsification techniques confirms our theoretical finding and shows that the metric backbone is an efficient sparsifier in the presence of communities.

Why Transformers Need Adam: A Hessian Perspective
SGD performs worse than Adam by a significant margin on Transformers, but the reason remains unclear.In this work, we provide an explanation of SGD's failure on Transformers through the lens of Hessian: (i) Transformers are "heterogeneous'': the Hessian spectrum across parameter blocks vary dramatically, a phenomenon we call `"block heterogeneity"; (ii) Heterogeneity hampers SGD: SGD performs badly on problems with block heterogeneity.  To validate that heterogeneity hampers SGD, we check various Transformers, CNNs, MLPs, and quadratic problems, and find that SGD works well on problems without block heterogeneity but performs badly when the heterogeneity exists. Our initial theoretical analysis indicates that SGD  fails because it applies one single learning rate to all blocks, which cannot handle the heterogeneity among blocks. The failure could be rescued if we could use coordinate-wise learning rates, as designed in Adam.

Why Warmup the Learning Rate? Underlying Mechanisms and Improvements
In modern deep learning, it is common to warm up the learning rate $\eta$, often by a linear schedule between $\eta_{\text{init}} = 0$ and a predetermined target $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$. In this paper, we show through systematic experiments with SGD and Adam that the overwhelming benefit of warmup arises from allowing the network to tolerate larger $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$ by forcing the network to more well-conditioned areas of the loss landscape. The ability to handle larger target learning rates in turn makes hyperparameter tuning more robust while improving the final performance of the network. We uncover different regimes of operation during the warmup period, depending on whether the network training starts off in a progressive sharpening or sharpness reduction phase, which in turn depends on the initialization and parameterization. Using these insights, we show how $\eta_{\text{init}}$ can be properly chosen by utilizing the loss catapult mechanism, which saves on the number of warmup steps, in some cases completely eliminating the need for warmup. We also suggest an initialization for the variance in Adam, which provides benefits similar to warmup.

Wide Two-Layer Networks can Learn from Adversarial Perturbations
Adversarial examples have raised several open questions, such as why they can deceive classifiers and transfer between different models. A prevailing hypothesis to explain these phenomena suggests that adversarial perturbations appear as random noise but contain class-specific features. This hypothesis is supported by the success of perturbation learning, where classifiers trained solely on adversarial examples and the corresponding incorrect labels generalize well to correctly labeled test data. Although this hypothesis and perturbation learning are effective in explaining intriguing properties of adversarial examples, their solid theoretical foundation is limited. In this study, we theoretically explain the counterintuitive success of perturbation learning. We assume wide two-layer networks and the results hold for any data distribution. We prove that adversarial perturbations contain sufficient class features for networks to generalize from them. Moreover, the predictions of classifiers trained on mislabeled adversarial examples coincide with those of classifiers trained on correctly labeled clean samples.

WikiDBs: A Large-Scale Corpus Of Relational Databases From Wikidata
Deep learning on tabular data, and particularly tabular representation learning, has recently gained growing interest.However, representation learning for relational databases with multiple tables is still an underexplored area, which may be attributed to the lack of openly available resources.To support the development of foundation models for tabular data and relational databases, we introduce WikiDBs, a novel open-source corpus of 100,000 relational databases.Each database consists of multiple tables connected by foreign keys.The corpus is based on Wikidata and follows the characteristics of real-world databases.In this paper, we describe the dataset and our method for creating it.By making our code publicly available, we enable others to create tailored versions of the dataset, for example, by creating databases in different languages.Finally, we conduct a set of initial experiments to showcase how WikiDBs can be used to train for the tasks of missing value imputation and the prediction of column and table names.

WildGaussians: 3D Gaussian Splatting In the Wild
While the field of 3D scene reconstruction is dominated by NeRFs due to their photorealistic quality, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged, offering similar quality with real-time rendering speeds. However, both methods primarily excel with well-controlled 3D scenes, while in-the-wild data - characterized by occlusions, dynamic objects, and varying illumination - remain challenging. NeRFs can adapt to such conditions easily through per-image embedding vectors, but 3DGS struggles due to its explicit representation and lack of shared parameters. To address this, we introduce WildGaussians, a novel approach to handle occlusions and appearance changes with 3DGS. By leveraging robust DINO features and integrating an appearance modeling module within 3DGS, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. We demonstrate that WildGaussians matches the real-time rendering speed of 3DGS while surpassing both 3DGS and NeRF baselines in handling in-the-wild data, all within a simple architectural framework.

WildPPG: A Real-World PPG Dataset of Long Continuous Recordings
Reflective photoplethysmography (PPG) has become the standard sensing technique in wearable devices to monitor cardiac activity via a person's heart rate (HR). However, PPG-based HR estimates can be substantially impacted by factors such as the wearer's activities, resulting motion artifacts, sensor placement, and environmental characteristics such as temperature, all of which can decrease prediction reliability. In this paper, we show that state-of-the-art HR estimation methods struggle with representative data from everyday activities in outdoor environments, likely due to their reliance on existing datasets that captured controlled conditions. We introduce a novel dataset and benchmark results for continuous PPG recordings from 16 participants over 13.5 hours, captured from wearable sensors on four different locations on the body, totaling 216 hours. The recordings include accelerometer, temperature, and altitude data, as well as a synchronized Lead I-based electrocardiogram for ground-truth HR references. Participants completed a round trip to a tall mountain in Europe over the course of one day. This included outdoor and indoor activities such as walking, hiking, stair climbing, eating, drinking, and resting at various altitude levels and temperatures as well as taking trains, cable cars, lifts, and cars for transport---all of which impacted participants' physiological dynamics. We also introduce a HR estimation method, compare it with existing baselines, and show that it can produce more robust values for the real-world scenarios captured by our dataset.  The dataset and HR estimation method are available at https://siplab.ethz.ch/datasets/wildppg-neurips-2024/

Wormhole Loss for Partial Shape Matching
When matching parts of a surface to its whole, a fundamental question arises: Which points should be included in the matching process? The issue is intensified when using isometry to measure similarity, as it requires the validation of whether distances measured between pairs of surface points should influence the matching process. The approach we propose treats surfaces as manifolds equipped with geodesic distances, and addresses the partial shape matching challenge by introducing a novel criterion to meticulously search for consistent distances between pairs of points. The new criterion explores the relation between intrinsic geodesic distances between the points, geodesic distances between the points and surface boundaries, and extrinsic distances between boundary points measured in the embedding space. It is shown to be less restrictive compared to previous measures and achieves state-of-the-art results when used as a loss function in training networks for partial shape matching.

XMask3D: Cross-modal Mask Reasoning for Open Vocabulary 3D Semantic Segmentation
Existing methodologies in open vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation primarily concentrate on establishing a unified feature space encompassing 3D, 2D, and textual modalities. Nevertheless, traditional techniques such as global feature alignment or vision-language model distillation tend to impose only approximate correspondence, struggling notably with delineating fine-grained segmentation boundaries. To address this gap, we propose a more meticulous mask-level alignment between 3D features and the 2D-text embedding space through a cross-modal mask reasoning framework, XMask3D. In our approach, we developed a mask generator based on the denoising UNet from a pre-trained diffusion model, leveraging its capability for precise textual control over dense pixel representations and enhancing the open-world adaptability of the generated masks. We further integrate 3D global features as implicit conditions into the pre-trained 2D denoising UNet, enabling the generation of segmentation masks with additional 3D geometry awareness. Subsequently, the generated 2D masks are employed to align mask-level 3D representations with the vision-language feature space, thereby augmenting the open vocabulary capability of 3D geometry embeddings. Finally, we fuse complementary 2D and 3D mask features, resulting in competitive performance across multiple benchmarks for 3D open vocabulary semantic segmentation.

X-Ray: A Sequential 3D Representation For Generation
We introduce X-Ray, a novel 3D representation inspired by the penetrability of x-ray scans. X-Ray transforms a 3D object into a series of surface frames at different layers, making it suitable for generating 3D models from images. Our method utilizes ray casting from the camera center to capture geometric and textured details, including depth, normal, and color, across all intersected surfaces. This process efficiently condenses complete 3D objects into a multi-frame video format, motivating the utilize of a network architecture similar to those in video diffusion models. This design ensures an efficient 3D representation by focusing solely on surface information. Also, we propose a two-stage pipeline to generate 3D objects from X-Ray Diffusion Model and Upsampler. We demonstrate the practicality and adaptability of our X-Ray representation by synthesizing the complete visible and hidden surfaces of a 3D object from a single input image. Experimental results reveal the state-of-the-art superiority of our representation in enhancing the accuracy of 3D generation, paving the way for new 3D sequential representation research and practical applications.

You Don't Need Data-Augmentations in Self-Supervised Learning
Self-Supervised learning (SSL) with Joint-Embedding Architectures (JEA) has led to outstanding performances. All instantiations of this paradigm were trained using strong and well-established hand-crafted data augmentations, leading to the general belief that they are required for the proper training and performance of such models. On the other hand, generative reconstruction-based models such as BEIT and MAE or Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures such as I-JEPA have shown strong performance without using data augmentations except masking. In this work, we challenge the importance of invariance and data-augmentation in JEAs at scale. By running a case-study on a recent SSL foundation model -- DINOv2 -- we show that strong image representations can be obtained with JEAs and only cropping without resizing provided the training data is large enough, reaching state-of-the-art results and using the least amount of augmentation in the literature. Through this study, we also discuss the impact of compute constraints on the outcomes of experimental deep learning research, showing that they can lead to very different conclusions.

You May Better Reconstruct Anomalous over Normal Graphs: Analysis and a Simple Method for Reconstruction-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection
Graph autoencoders (Graph-AEs) learn representations of given graphs by aiming to reconstruct them. A notable application of Graph-AEs is graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD), whose objective is to identify graphs with anomalous topological structures and/or node features compared to the majority of the graph population. Graph-AEs for GLAD regard a graph with a high reconstruction error (i.e. mean aggregation of errors from all node pairs and/or nodes) as anomalies. Namely, the methods rest on the assumption that they would better reconstruct graphs with similar characteristics to the majority. We, however, report non-trivial counter-examples, a phenomenon we call reconstruction flip, and highlight the limitations of the existing Graph-AE-based GLAD methods. Specifically, we empirically and theoretically investigate when this assumption holds and when it fails. Through our analyses, we further argue that while the reconstruction errors for a given graph are effective features for GLAD, leveraging the multifaceted summaries of the reconstruction errors, beyond just average, can further strengthen the features. Thus, we propose a novel and simple GLAD method, named MUSE. The key innovation of MUSE involves taking multifaceted summaries of reconstruction errors as graph features for GLAD. This surprisingly simple method obtains SOTA performance in GLAD, performing best overall among 14 methods across 10 datasets.

Your contrastive learning problem is secretly a distribution alignment problem
Despite the success of contrastive learning (CL) in vision and language, its theoretical foundations and mechanisms for arranging representations remain poorly understood. In this work, we build connections between noise contrastive estimation losses widely used in CL and distribution alignment with entropic optimal transport (OT). This connection allows us to develop a family of different losses and multistep variants for existing CL methods. Intuitively, by using more information from the distribution of latents, our approach allows a more distribution-aware  manipulation of the relationships within augmented sample sets.  We provide theoretical insights and experimental evidence demonstrating the benefits of our approach for generalized contrastive alignment. Through this framework, it is possible to leverage tools in OT to build unbalanced losses to handle noisy views and customize the representation space by changing the constraints on alignment. By reframing contrastive learning as an alignment problem and leveraging existing optimization tools for OT, our work provides new insights and connections between different self-supervised learning models in addition to new tools that can be more easily adapted to incorporate domain knowledge into learning.

Your Diffusion Model is Secretly a Noise Classifier and Benefits from Contrastive Training
Diffusion models learn to denoise data and the trained denoiser is then used to generate new samples from the data distribution. In this paper, we revisit the diffusion sampling process and identify a fundamental cause of sample quality degradation: the denoiser is poorly estimated in regions that are far Outside Of the training Distribution (OOD), and the sampling process inevitably evaluates in these OOD regions.This can become problematic for all sampling methods, especially when we move to parallel sampling which requires us to initialize and update the entire sample trajectory of dynamics in parallel, leading to many OOD evaluations. To address this problem, we introduce a new self-supervised training objective that differentiates the levels of noise added to a sample, leading to improved OOD denoising performance. The approach is based on our observation that diffusion models implicitly define a log-likelihood ratio that distinguishes distributions with different amounts of noise, and this expression depends on denoiser performance outside the standard training distribution.We show by diverse experiments that the proposed contrastive diffusion training is effective for both sequential and parallel settings, and it improves the performance and speed of parallel samplers significantly.

ZeroMark: Towards Dataset Ownership Verification without Disclosing Dataset-specified Watermarks
High-quality public datasets (\eg, ImageNet) significantly prompt the prosperity of deep neural networks (DNNs). Currently, dataset ownership verification (DOV), which consists of dataset watermarking and ownership verification, is the only feasible solution to protect their copyright by preventing unauthorized use. In this paper, we revisit existing DOV methods and find that they all mainly focused on the first stage by designing different types of dataset watermarks and directly exploiting watermarked samples as the verification samples for ownership verification. As such, their success relies on an underlying assumption that verification is a \emph{one-time} and \emph{privacy-preserving} process, which does not necessarily hold in practice. To alleviate this problem, we propose \emph{ZeroMark} to conduct ownership verification without disclosing dataset-specified watermarks. Our method is inspired by our empirical and theoretical findings of the intrinsic property of DNNs trained on the watermarked dataset. Specifically, ZeroMark first generates the closest boundary version of given benign samples and calculates their boundary gradients under the black-box setting. After that, it examines whether the given suspicious method has been trained on the protected dataset by performing a hypothesis test, based on the cosine similarity measured on the boundary gradients and the watermark pattern. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our ZeroMark and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks.

Zero-Shot Image Segmentation via Recursive Normalized Cut on Diffusion Features
Foundation models have emerged as powerful tools across various domains including language, vision, and multimodal tasks. While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we consider a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and we introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previously state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation across multiple benchmarks. In particular, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

Zeroth-Order Sampling Methods for Non-Log-Concave Distributions: Alleviating Metastability by Denoising Diffusion
This paper considers the problem of sampling from non-logconcave distribution, based on queries of its unnormalized density. It first describes a framework, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), based on the simulation of a denoising diffusion process with its score function approximated by a generic Monte Carlo estimator. DMC is an oracle-based meta-algorithm, where its oracle is the assumed access to samples that generate a Monte Carlo score estimator. Then we provide an implementation of this oracle, based on rejection sampling, and this turns DMC into a true algorithm, termed Zeroth-Order Diffusion Monte Carlo (ZOD-MC). We provide convergence analyses by first constructing a general framework, i.e., a performance guarantee for DMC, without assuming the target distribution to be log-concave or satisfying any isoperimetric inequality. Then we prove that ZOD-MC admits an inverse polynomial dependence on the desired sampling accuracy, albeit still suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Consequently, for low dimensional distributions, ZOD-MC is a very efficient sampler, with performance exceeding latest samplers, including also-denoising-diffusion-based RDMC and RS-DMC. Last, we experimentally demonstrate the insensitivity of ZOD-MC to increasingly higher barriers between modes or discontinuity in non-convex potential.

Zero-to-Hero: Enhancing Zero-Shot Novel View Synthesis via Attention Map Filtering
Generating realistic images from arbitrary views based on a single source image remains a significant challenge in computer vision, with broad applications ranging from e-commerce to immersive virtual experiences. Recent advancements in diffusion models, particularly the Zero-1-to-3 model, have been widely adopted for generating plausible views, videos, and 3D models. However, these models still struggle with inconsistencies and implausibility in new views generation, especially for challenging changes in viewpoint. In this work, we propose Zero-to-Hero, a novel test-time approach that enhances view synthesis by manipulating attention maps during the denoising process of Zero-1-to-3. By drawing an analogy between the denoising process and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we implement a filtering mechanism that aggregates attention maps, enhancing generation reliability and authenticity. This process improves geometric consistency without requiring retraining or significant computational resources. Additionally, we modify the self-attention mechanism to integrate information from the source view, reducing shape distortions. These processes are further supported by a specialized sampling schedule. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in fidelity and consistency, validated on a diverse set of out-of-distribution objects.
